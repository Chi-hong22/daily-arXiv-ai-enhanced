*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TinyViT-Batten框架，使用小参数Vision Transformer通过少样本学习检测早期Batten病，在79例患者和90例对照的MRI数据上达到91%准确率和0.95 AUC，优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病是一种罕见的儿童神经退行性疾病，早期MRI征象细微且常被漏诊，需要开发能够在有限训练样本下准确检测的AI方法。

Method: 将大型教师ViT蒸馏为5M参数TinyViT，使用基于度量的少样本学习（原型损失，5-shot episodes）进行微调，并集成Grad-CAM实现可解释预测。

Result: 在多中心数据集上达到约91%准确率、ROC曲线下面积至少0.95，敏感性>90%、特异性约90%，优于3D-ResNet和Swin-Tiny基线模型。

Conclusion: 模型的小尺寸和强性能展示了早期Batten病检测的实用AI解决方案，通过可解释性方法突出了疾病相关脑区。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

Precision, and inference speed are analyzed to highlight trade-offs between
accuracy and efficiency. Deployment and application perspectives are further
discussed, covering export formats, quantization strategies, and real-world use
in robotics, agriculture, surveillance, and manufacturing. Finally, the paper

hybrid CNN-Transformer integration, open-vocabulary detection, and edge-aware
training approaches.

Motivation: 医学图像分析中，现有方法在数据充足时表现良好，但面临数据稀缺和置信度低的挑战，需要开发适应小数据集的鲁棒方法。

Method: TreeNet是一种分层决策集成学习方法，整合神经网络、集成学习和树基决策模型的关键特征。

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT)，通过B-Spline编码和多阶段残差量化技术，为视觉-语言-动作模型学习紧凑、可迁移的动作表示，将训练序列缩短6.8倍，并支持跨具身学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归VLA模型在处理动作块时会产生长序列和高维度问题，现有压缩方法存在重构质量差或压缩效率低的问题，需要更高效的动作表示方法。

Method: 首先通过B-Spline编码对值范围和时间范围进行归一化，然后对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间应用多阶段残差量化，生成具有粗细粒度的压缩离散标记。

Result: 在Droid大规模数据集上预训练后，离散标记化将训练序列缩短6.8倍，降低目标熵，同时保持重构质量，实现更快的AR训练收敛和更好的模型性能。

Conclusion: OmniSAT提供了更高的压缩效率，同时保持重构质量，支持跨具身学习策略，能够利用异构的自我中心视频进行可扩展的辅助监督。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

Conclusion: EvoCAD证明了结合语言模型和进化算法在CAD生成任务中的有效性，新提出的基于欧拉特征的拓扑指标能有效补充现有空间指标。

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

### [6] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的知识感知Mamba（KAMamba）方法用于增强MODIS变化检测，通过知识驱动的转移矩阵、多任务学习和时空谱Mamba模块来解决MODIS数据中的混合像素、信息耦合和背景异质性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS时间序列变化检测对于环境监测至关重要，但由于混合像素、空间-光谱-时间信息耦合效应以及背景类别异质性等关键MODIS难题，这是一项极具挑战性的任务。

Method: 设计了知识驱动的转移矩阵方法（KAT-loss）、多任务学习方法（PreC-loss、PostC-loss、Chg-loss）、空间-光谱-时间Mamba模块（SSTMamba）以及稀疏可变形Mamba骨干网络（SDMamba）。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS时间序列数据集上评估，变化检测的平均F1得分比基线提高了约1.5-6%，LULC分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标提高了约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba方法有效解决了MODIS变化检测中的关键挑战，在变化检测和土地覆盖分类任务上都取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [7] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NNDM混合框架，结合NN-UNet的鲁棒特征提取和扩散概率模型的生成能力，通过迭代去噪过程提升脑肿瘤分割的边界精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型如U-Net在脑肿瘤MRI分割中存在泛化能力不足、边界精度差和数据多样性有限的问题。

Method: 将NN-UNet与扩散模型结合，扩散模型通过学习预测分割掩码与真实掩码之间的残差分布，迭代细化NN-UNet生成的分割结果。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，NNDM相比传统U-Net和基于transformer的基线方法，在Dice系数和Hausdorff距离指标上表现更优，且对不同模态和肿瘤子区域具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NNDM为确定性分割网络与随机扩散模型的结合开辟了新方向，推进了自动化脑肿瘤分析的技术水平。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的微表情识别方法，包括两种互补表示（时间排序动态图像和运动强度动态图像）和自适应融合网络，在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情是细微、短暂的面部变化，强度极低，几乎难以察觉，但能揭示真实情感。在谎言检测、行为分析和心理评估中具有重要价值。

Method: 提出两种互补表示：时间排序动态图像（强调时间进展）和运动强度动态图像（通过帧重排序机制突出细微运动）；提出自适应融合网络，自动学习最优整合这两种表示。

Result: 在CASME-II数据集上达到93.95%准确率和0.897 UF1，创下新纪录；在SAMM数据集上达到82.47%准确率和0.665 UF1，显示更均衡的类别识别；在MMEW数据集上达到76.00%准确率，验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的输入表示和网络架构在提升微表情识别性能中发挥重要作用，为情感计算、谎言检测和人机交互领域的进一步研究和实际应用奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [10] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过多模态大语言模型的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，在不改变模型权重或架构的情况下，将空间分辨率重新分配到模型认为重要的区域，从而提高细粒度感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在杂乱场景中经常错过小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知基础错误。

Method: 使用MLLM的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，重新分配空间分辨率到重要区域，同时保留全局上下文。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM上，AttWarp持续提高准确性，增强组合推理能力，减少幻觉，优于四种竞争性基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲优先处理与查询相关的信息，同时保留上下文，相同的MLLM在接收这种扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，使用扩散模型将合成数据集适配到特定目标域，通过伪标签训练生成高保真、目标对齐的图像，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集与真实图像存在明显差距，特别是在特定目标域（如Cityscapes）中，这种差距限制了模型性能。传统方法需要昂贵的3D建模，而本方法旨在低成本地弥合这一差距。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，仅通过不完美的伪标签进行目标域适配训练，生成与目标域对齐的高质量图像，并过滤次优生成、修正图像标签不对齐问题，统一跨数据集的语义。

Result: 在五个合成数据集和两个真实目标数据集上的实验显示，分割性能比最先进的翻译方法提升高达8.0% mIoU，使快速构建的合成数据集达到与耗时数月手动设计的数据集相当的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了快速语义原型设计与生成模型相结合的价值，为城市场景理解提供了可扩展、高质量的训练数据创建范式。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

TL;DR: 研究多模态外语学习环境中，学习者如何通过图像-句子配对推断生词含义，分析影响推断成功的数据特征和参与者语言背景，并评估AI系统预测学习者表现的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在多模态语境（图像配句子）中学习者推断生词含义的新外语学习场景，了解哪些数据特征和语言背景因素影响学习效果。

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本配对，分析图像和文本特征与参与者推断生词成功率的关联，同时评估AI系统预测参与者表现的能力。

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，需要进一步研究预测性特征；AI系统在预测参与者表现方面显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态外语学习环境中的生词推断任务需要更深入的特征分析，AI系统在该领域的推理能力有进一步发展的空间。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

Motivation: 现实世界的视觉语言应用需要不同层次的感知粒度，但现有视觉大语言模型通常假设固定的下游任务分辨率，导致性能不佳。

Method: 首先全面调查不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好，发现分辨率偏好与图像复杂度和VLLM在不同分辨率下的不确定性方差相关；然后提出经验公式确定最优分辨率；最后开发参数高效的微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的视觉输入分辨率。

Result: 在各种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过分析分辨率偏好并开发相应的微调技术，能够有效提升视觉大语言模型在不同视觉语言任务上的性能。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卫星图像特征质量较低，分割结果通常不够清晰，需要找到合适的CRF方法来改善分割效果。

Method: 使用不同类型的CRF进行实验，在低质量卫星图像和高质量航空照片两个数据集上进行评估和比较。

Result: 通过实验找出了在不同类型图像上表现最佳的CRF方法，揭示了各种方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 研究展示了不同CRF方法在图像分割中的潜力和局限性，为选择合适的CRF方法提供了指导。

Abstract: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to
low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find
a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a

why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on
these datasets to show the pitfalls and potentials of different approaches.

TL;DR: 使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测，通过增量测试协议评估泛化能力，发现适度添加合成图像可提升性能，但仅使用合成数据效果最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题导致真实人脸图像数据集规模有限的问题，探索合成数据在单形态攻击检测中的应用价值。

Method: 采用多种形态生成工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议来评估随着合成图像添加的泛化能力变化。

Result: 实验结果显示，在现有数据集中谨慎添加适量合成图像或逐步添加真实图像可改善泛化能力，但过度使用合成数据会导致性能下降，仅使用合成数据时等错误率最高。

Conclusion: 在操作场景中，最佳策略不是仅依赖合成数据进行单形态攻击检测，需要平衡使用合成和真实数据。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新型像素聚类方法，利用细胞边界特征和标签将前景像素划分为细胞实例，在六个数据集上优于现有像素聚类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的细胞实例分割方法使用像素级目标（如距离图、热扩散图等）可能会丢失细胞实例的重要几何特性（如形状、曲率、凸性），这些特性需要像素集合才能表示。

Method: Ceb方法从语义分割生成的概率图开始，首先使用改进的Watershed算法提取潜在的前景-前景边界。为每个边界候选构建边界特征表示（边界签名），然后使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过划分或合并相邻区域获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比具有高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb通过利用细胞边界特征和标签，有效解决了像素级目标可能丢失几何特性的问题，在细胞实例分割任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL)框架，通过在分类logits空间进行集成而非特征空间平均，解决传统提示集成方法导致类别中心偏移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示集成方法通过在特征空间平均文本特征来集成上下文提示，但这种方法会使得类别中心偏离真实类别分布，导致次优结果。

Method: CAPEL框架将图像分类到多个类别簇中，每个簇由不同的提示表示。在分类logits空间进行集成，并引入簇保持正则化项来维持提示的区分性，同时使用自适应提示加权技术动态调整有缺陷或模糊提示的注意力权重。

Result: 该方法能更好地与视觉特征分布对齐，在各种数据集和任务上实现鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: CAPEL通过保持上下文提示的簇性质，在分类logits空间进行集成，相比传统特征平均方法能获得更优的零样本迁移性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多目标跟踪方法，通过融合深度和掩码特征，使用自监督编码器生成稳定的物体表示，作为相似性线索与边界框IoU和重识别特征一起用于匹配，避免计算分割掩码IoU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在物体相似或被遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割掩码IoU计算成本高。

Method: 使用零样本深度估计器获取深度图，提示式视觉分割模型获取物体掩码，融合深度和掩码特征通过自监督编码器生成物体表示，作为额外相似性线索。

Result: 在具有非线性运动、遮挡和拥挤场景的挑战性基准测试（如SportsMOT和DanceTrack）中，该方法在大多数指标上优于TBD最先进方法，在简单线性运动基准（如MOT17）上达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器优化分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，在复杂场景中表现出色，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

Conclusion: CHUG数据集填补了UGC-HDR视频质量评估的空白，预计将推动无参考HDR-VQA研究的发展，提供了大规模、多样化和真实世界的UGC数据集。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景通常具有不规则布局和不同复杂度，包含杂乱、遮挡和平坦墙壁。传统均匀基础排列方法无法有效利用有限资源。

Method: 在估计的几何支架上记录观测统计，指导基础的最优放置；提出场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中的几何缺陷并施加正则化。

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中，相比采用规则放置的基线方法，渲染质量和内存需求均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 场景自适应策略能够有效利用几何先验优化表示能力分配，显著改善室内场景的沉浸式体验生成效果。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

TL;DR: 提出LTGS方法，从稀疏视角更新中构建长期高斯场景时序，能够高效处理日常环境变化，支持快速轻量级更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法在处理日常环境变化时面临挑战，需要密集的空间和时间观测。稀疏视角的随意捕捉难以应对频繁的场景变化。

Method: 将对象建模为模板高斯，作为共享对象轨迹的结构化可重用先验。通过少量观测对模板进行细化，适应时间变化的环境。支持通过简单变换实现多时间步泛化。

Result: 相比其他基线方法，实现了更优的重建质量，同时支持快速轻量级更新。在真实世界数据集上验证了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: LTGS框架能够从稀疏视角的随意捕捉中稳健建模场景的长期时序变化，显著提升了3D环境时序演化的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个多视角动物姿态估计框架，结合新颖的训练和后处理技术，通过模型蒸馏产生更高效准确的姿态估计器，在有限标注数据下实现可靠跟踪和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下难以实现准确跟踪，且不确定性估计效果不佳，需要解决这些挑战以支持科学研究的动物行为量化。

Method: 开发多视角transformer(MVT)同时处理所有视角信息，使用补丁掩码方案学习跨视角对应关系；结合几何一致性的3D增强和三角化损失；扩展非线性Ensemble Kalman Smoother后处理器，通过方差膨胀技术增强不确定性量化；设计蒸馏过程利用改进的EKS预测生成高质量伪标签。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界数据约束下的可靠姿态估计提供了实用解决方案，支持下游行为分析，显著减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HeadsUp模型，这是一个单步扩散模型，专门用于肖像图像超分辨率，能够端到端地无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，避免传统混合方法产生的边界伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超分辨率技术要么针对通用真实世界图像，要么针对严格对齐的人脸图像。处理肖像照片时需要混合使用不同模型，导致面部区域出现混合或边界伪影，而人类感知对脸部保真度特别敏感。

Method: 基于单步扩散模型构建，开发了面部监督机制引导模型关注面部区域，集成基于参考的机制帮助身份恢复，减少低质量人脸恢复中的模糊性。还构建了高质量的4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Conclusion: HeadsUp通过端到端的单步扩散模型有效解决了肖像图像超分辨率问题，避免了传统混合方法产生的边界伪影问题。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

Motivation: 纵向MRI数据在分析脑老化轨迹时面临离散采样、时空模式不一致的挑战，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示(INR)将纵向T1加权MRI数据建模为连续函数，设计新颖的INR架构部分解耦时空轨迹参数，并在INR参数空间直接进行分类。

Result: 在模拟数据实验中，不规则采样情况下INR方法达到81.3%的脑老化轨迹分类准确率，优于标准深度学习基线模型的73.7%。

Conclusion: INR方法能够有效处理纵向神经影像数据的不规则采样问题，为脑老化轨迹分析提供了更准确的连续建模框架。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

TL;DR: 提出J-RAS联合训练方法，将分割模型与检索模型联合优化，通过检索图像-掩码对增强分割性能，在多个数据集和架构上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中标注数据稀缺、泛化能力差的问题，传统AI方法需要大量标注数据且难以适应不同成像条件和罕见病例。

Method: 联合训练分割模型和检索模型，分割模型利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强解剖理解，检索模型学习分割相关特征而非简单视觉相似性。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，SegFormer结合J-RAS将Dice分数从0.8708提升到0.9115，Hausdorff距离从1.8130降低到1.1489，在多个架构上均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: J-RAS方法通过联合优化有效提升了分割性能，具有良好的通用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于AI的端到端框架，利用现有交通摄像头进行大规模高分辨率交通监测，通过YOLOv11模型提取交通指标，图基视角归一化处理动态摄像头，集成领域专用大语言模型自动生成交通模式摘要，在纽约拥堵收费政策实施期间验证了系统有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通传感器部署成本高昂，而现有视频分析技术难以处理大规模摄像头网络的动态视角和海量数据，需要开发成本效益高、可扩展的交通监测解决方案。

Method: 使用微调YOLOv11模型进行实时交通密度和分类指标提取；提出图基视角归一化方法处理非固定PTZ摄像头；集成领域专用大语言模型处理24/7视频流数据并生成自动化摘要。

Result: 在纽约拥堵收费政策早期实施期间，工作日乘客车辆密度在拥堵缓解区内下降9%；卡车流量早期减少但出现反弹迹象；行人和自行车活动在走廊和区域尺度上持续增加；基于示例的提示提高了LLM的数值准确性并减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 该框架证明可作为实用、基础设施就绪的解决方案，用于大规模、政策相关的交通监测，所需人工干预极少。

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理原理的镜头光晕数据生成方法FlareX，包含参数化模板创建、光照感知的2D合成和基于物理引擎的3D渲染三个阶段，解决了现有合成数据集缺乏光晕多样性和忽略物理原理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光晕数据集通常通过在背景图像上叠加人工光晕模板来合成，但由于模板缺乏多样性和忽略物理原理，导致训练模型在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 三阶段方法：1）参数化模板创建；2）光照感知的2D合成；3）基于物理引擎的3D渲染，最终得到包含2D和3D视角的混合数据集FlareX。

Result: 生成包含9,500个2D模板（来自95种光晕模式）和3,000个光晕图像对（来自60个3D场景）的数据集，并通过掩码方法从真实图像中获取无光晕图像用于模型评估。

Conclusion: 大量实验证明了所提方法和数据集的有效性，能够更好地泛化到真实世界场景。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了BurstDeflicker数据集，通过三种互补的数据采集策略解决闪烁伪影问题，包括基于Retinex的合成方法、真实场景采集和绿幕方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决滚动快门相机在交流电照明下产生的闪烁伪影问题，这些伪影表现为图像中的暗带，不仅影响图像质量，还影响物体检测和跟踪等高级任务。缺乏大规模真实数据集阻碍了闪烁去除研究的发展。

Method: 1. 开发基于Retinex的合成流水线，可控制关键闪烁属性；2. 采集4000张真实世界闪烁图像；3. 提出绿幕方法在动态场景中保留真实闪烁退化。

Result: 构建了一个可扩展的基准数据集，综合实验证明了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker数据集具有推动闪烁去除研究发展的潜力，通过多种数据采集策略解决了现有数据集的不足。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

TL;DR: 提出了MIMO模型，解决医疗视觉语言模型的两个问题：输入缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解，输出缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。通过多模态输入和像素级定位输出，实现视觉引用和像素定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型存在两个问题：输入仅依赖文本指令而缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解；输出仅提供文本答案而缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。

Method: 提出统一的医疗视觉语言模型MIMO，具有视觉引用多模态输入和像素定位多模态输出。构建了包含89.5万样本的MIMOSeg数据集，从四个不同角度覆盖基础指令跟随和复杂问答。

Result: 在多个下游医疗多模态任务上的实验结果表明，MIMO能够独特地结合视觉引用和像素定位能力，这是先前模型所不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型成功解决了医疗视觉语言模型在输入和输出方面的局限性，通过多模态输入输出设计实现了对复杂医疗图像和语义的更好理解与定位。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Query-Adapter（Q-Adapter），一种轻量级视觉适配器模块，用于增强多模态大语言模型在视频字幕任务中的高效微调，仅需1.4%的参数即可达到与全微调方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法主要关注语言组件，在多模态任务中探索不足，且缺乏对视觉信息的充分理解。为解决这一问题，需要开发能够有效提取稀疏、字幕相关特征的视觉适配器。

Method: Q-Adapter在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询标记和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取与字幕相关的稀疏特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，Q-Adapter在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上均达到参数高效微调方法中的最先进性能，且仅需1.4%的参数即可与全微调方法竞争。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在平衡字幕质量和参数效率方面具有强大潜力，展示了其在视频语言建模中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

TL;DR: P-4DGS是一种用于紧凑4D场景建模的动态3D高斯泼溅表示方法，通过时空预测和量化编码技术显著降低存储需求，在保持高质量重建的同时实现高达90倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3DGS算法忽略了动态场景中固有的时空冗余性，导致内存消耗过高，需要一种更紧凑的4D场景表示方法。

Method: 设计基于3D锚点的时空预测模块来利用高斯基元间的时空相关性，结合自适应量化策略和基于上下文的熵编码来压缩3D锚点。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实现最先进的重建质量和最快的渲染速度，平均存储占用仅约1MB，在合成和真实场景上分别实现40倍和90倍压缩。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过有效利用时空冗余和先进的压缩技术，为动态3D场景重建提供了一种高效且紧凑的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而基于Transformer的方法在提取多模态系数和时序动态方面存在不足，需要一种能同时处理局部和全局信息、捕获时空上下文的新方法。

Method: CCFormer包含三个核心模块：早期集成模块(EIM)使用并行双边架构融合多尺度视觉和音频特征；多查询变换器模块(MTM)动态赋予音频查询学习能力，同时建模帧级和视频级关系；双模态对比学习(BCL)促进统一特征空间中的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上均达到了新的最先进性能基准。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过有效结合局部全局信息处理和时空上下文捕获，成功克服了现有方法的局限性，为音频-视觉分割任务提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家在临床实践中会迭代扫描、聚焦和优化感兴趣区域。ViTAR旨在缩小这种机器与人类感知差距。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，将医学图像视为交互对象，支持多步视觉推理。构建了包含1K交互示例的高质量指令数据集和16K视觉问答训练数据。采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调引导认知轨迹，强化学习优化决策。

Result: ViTAR在广泛评估中优于现有最先进模型。视觉注意力分析显示，从"思考"到"再思考"阶段，ViTAR逐渐将视觉基础锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型可以增强医学AI的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CLSL方法解决多标签图像识别中标签不完整问题，通过语义感知特征学习和标签恢复的协同学习框架，在MS-COCO、VOC2007和NUS-WIDE数据集上取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多标签图像识别中标签不完整情况下的两个核心挑战：语义感知特征学习和缺失标签恢复。

Method: 设计语义相关特征学习模块学习鲁棒语义特征；提出语义引导特征增强模块生成高质量语义感知特征；引入协同学习框架整合特征学习和标签恢复。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的公共数据集（MS-COCO、VOC2007和NUS-WIDE）上，CLSL优于现有的多标签图像识别方法。

Conclusion: CLSL方法通过协同学习框架有效解决了多标签图像识别中的标签不完整问题，形成了特征学习和标签恢复相互增强的循环。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PHG-MAE模型，将神经图与掩码自编码器结合，通过随机掩码整个模态来采样超边分布，将预训练和微调统一到单个训练循环中，并支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用自监督预训练方法（如MAE）无需手动标注数据的优势，解决多模态多任务学习场景中的问题，特别是在无人机户外场景中处理多种世界解释和模态。

Method: 结合神经图和掩码自编码器，随机掩码整个模态而非仅图像块，在每次前向传播中采样超边分布，将预训练和微调统一到单个训练循环，支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。

Result: 开发了数据管道软件，创建并发布了Dronescapes数据集的自动化扩展版本，所有技术细节、代码和复现步骤均已公开。

Conclusion: PHG-MAE模型在多模态多任务学习中表现出色，特别是在无人机户外场景中，该方法可推广到自动驾驶或室内机器人等其他类似领域。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

*Meijun Zhou,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的通用框架，用于追踪大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化，通过将离散遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，实现滑坡演化的连续监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单阶段或前后双阶段滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，而这对理解演化机制和预警至关重要。

Method: 将离散光学遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，利用为视频分割开发的视觉基础模型，在知识引导、自动传播和交互精炼的范式下进行滑坡疤痕识别。

Result: 在巴格滑坡和色拉滑坡两个案例中验证，能够连续追踪滑坡疤痕，捕捉到对预警关键的失稳前兆和对评估次生灾害重要的失稳后演化。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化，为早期预警和长期稳定性评估提供重要支持。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够在无姿态稀疏图像下实现鲁棒的新视角合成和几何一致重建，通过VGGT基础模型获取初始姿态和密集点云，结合混合高斯表示、图引导属性优化和流式深度正则化等技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NeRF和3DGS对准确相机姿态和密集视角覆盖的依赖问题，使其在稀疏视角设置下也能可靠工作，扩展这些技术在现实场景中的适用性。

Method: 1) 使用VGGT基础模型获取可靠初始姿态和密集点云；2) 混合高斯表示结合位置-形状双重优化和视图间匹配一致性；3) 图引导属性优化模块增强场景细节；4) 流式深度正则化提升深度估计精度。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上，相比其他无姿态方法展现出更鲁棒的性能，定量和定性实验均验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架成功解决了稀疏视角下的3D重建和新视角合成问题，通过结合基础模型和多种优化技术，实现了比现有无姿态方法更可靠的性能。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督联邦学习主要关注表示学习和聚类任务，而视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的零样本预测能力为分类问题提供了新机会，但在无监督联邦学习范式下尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出FedCoPL方法：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分配以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，服务器聚合包含通用图像特征的视觉提示，客户端保留编码个性化知识的文本提示。

Result: 大量实验表明，FedCoPL相比基线方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 成功将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，通过伪标签分布调整和部分提示聚合实现了有效的协作学习和个性化。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了ACRE方法，通过一致性检查增强强化学习，解决多模态LLM中推理链与最终答案不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准GRPO方法在视觉问答任务中，推理步骤与答案的一致性仅为79.7%，存在推理与答案不匹配的问题。

Method: 修改GRPO算法，增加辅助一致性检查：打乱答案选项后，用相同的推理轨迹重新预测答案，设计一致性验证奖励机制。

Result: 在视频推理和数学推理基准测试中，相比GRPO基线分别平均提升2.2%和1.5%。

Conclusion: ACRE方法能有效惩罚推理-答案不一致，减少模型对虚假模式（如选项顺序偏差）的依赖。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和视觉特征重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑型深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法在效率和可靠性之间存在平衡问题，紧凑型模型如YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n在部署时容易出现误报和漏检，传统后处理方法仅依赖空间重叠，在复杂场景中效果有限。

Method: 提出轻量级置信度精炼网络，集成不确定性估计与颜色、边缘、纹理等视觉特征，在不修改基础模型的情况下调整检测分数。

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上的实验表明，相比现有基线方法，该方法在精确率、召回率和平均精度方面均有提升，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 后检测重评分方法能有效增强紧凑型深度学习模型在真实世界火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

Motivation: 图像篡改技术发展带来严重安全威胁，现有弱监督或无训练方法性能不足且缺乏可解释性，需要更有效的篡改定位方案。

Method: ICFC框架结合对象化规则构建和自适应过滤构建可靠知识库，采用多步渐进推理流程，从粗粒度提议到细粒度取证结果，系统利用MLLM推理能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICFC不仅超越最先进的无训练方法，还达到与弱监督和全监督方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: ICFC证明了无需训练即可实现高性能、可解释的图像篡改定位，为图像取证提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ImmerIris数据集，这是目前最大的公开VR头显采集的离轴虹膜数据集，包含499,791张图像和564个受试者。针对传统方法在沉浸式场景中表现不佳的问题，提出了无需归一化的识别方法，取得了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在增强现实和虚拟现实等自我中心应用中，沉浸式虹膜识别正在成为一种准确且无缝的身份识别方式。然而，传统系统在受控环境下通过专用正面传感器获取虹膜图像，而沉浸式设置主要通过倾斜放置的头显相机在开放场景中捕获离轴虹膜，这带来了透视畸变、质量退化加剧和虹膜纹理类内变化等独特挑战。

Method: 1) 构建ImmerIris数据集，通过VR头显采集大规模离轴虹膜图像；2) 建立评估协议来基准测试不同挑战因素下的识别方法；3) 提出无需归一化的识别范式，直接从眼部图像中学习，仅需最小调整。

Result: 当前主要为经典轴对齐图像设计的方法在沉浸式设置中表现不理想，主要依赖于易出错的归一化。提出的无需归一化方法尽管简单，但始终优于基于归一化的对应方法。

Conclusion: ImmerIris数据集填补了沉浸式虹膜识别数据稀缺的空白，提出的无需归一化方法为鲁棒的沉浸式识别指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

Motivation: 现有基于手势的帕金森病识别系统性能不佳，需要开发更准确的帕金森病严重程度评估方法以支持临床管理和干预开发。

Result: 模型在区分五个严重程度类别方面表现出色，证明集成时空表示与注意力机制可以改善自动化帕金森病严重程度检测。

Conclusion: 该系统有望成为支持临床医生进行帕金森病监测和进展跟踪的有前景的非侵入性工具。

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法存在SSIM和PSNR分数低、计算复杂度高的问题；传统GAN超分辨率方法参数过多，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用DeepFusionNet架构，包含约250万参数用于低光增强，约10万参数用于超分辨率，基于自编码器而非GAN。

Result: 在LOL-v1数据集上，低光增强达到SSIM 92.8%、PSNR 26.30；超分辨率达到PSNR 25.30、SSIM 80.7%。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在保持较少参数的同时，显著提升了低光图像增强和超分辨率的性能，为实时图像处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

TL;DR: Color3D是一个用于静态和动态3D场景着色的框架，通过个性化颜色器从单张关键视图传播颜色到新视角和时间步，确保跨视图和时间的一致性，同时保持颜色多样性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景，通过平均颜色变化来强制多视图一致性，但牺牲了颜色丰富性和可控性。Color3D旨在解决这一问题，在保持一致性的同时保留颜色多样性和用户控制能力。

Method: 核心方法是仅对单个关键视图着色，然后微调个性化颜色器，学习场景特定的确定性颜色映射，通过其固有归纳偏置将对应颜色传播到新视角和视频帧。使用Lab色彩空间高斯泼溅表示重建彩色3D场景。

Conclusion: Color3D巧妙地将复杂的3D着色问题重新定义为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，提供增强的灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺血性卒中诊断中，准确定位闭塞血管是一个关键挑战。现有机器学习方法主要关注病灶分割，血管定位研究有限。

Method: 结合nnUNet分割分支进行病灶检测，使用动脉图谱进行血管映射和识别，以及使用pGAN从MRI合成MRA图像的生成分支。

Result: 在卒中影响的T1 MRI扫描上定位闭塞血管显示出有希望的结果。

Abstract: A key challenge in ischemic stroke diagnosis using medical imaging is the
accurate localization of the occluded vessel. Current machine learning methods
in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel
localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep
learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization
using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using
nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and
identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images
from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and
more informed stroke diagnosis.

TL;DR: ReMix是一个统一的字符一致性生成和编辑框架，包含ReMix模块和IP-ControlNet两个核心组件，解决了现有方法在身份一致性和空间可控性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在单个框架中统一字符一致性生成和编辑任务，生成方法在细粒度身份一致性方面表现不佳，而编辑方法则容易失去空间可控性和指令对齐。

Conclusion: ReMix成功解决了字符一致性生成和编辑的统一问题，通过创新的模块设计实现了语义连贯性和像素级一致性的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

TL;DR: 提出SaFiRe框架解决指称图像分割中的模糊表达问题，通过模拟人类两阶段认知过程，利用Mamba的扫描-更新特性实现高效多轮细化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS方法主要处理简单表达，无法有效应对现实世界中的对象干扰表达和类别隐式表达等模糊指称场景。

Method: SaFiRe框架模拟人类两阶段认知：先形成全局理解，再通过细节导向检查进行细化，利用Mamba的扫描-更新特性支持多轮细化。

Result: 在标准数据集和提出的aRefCOCO基准上，SaFiRe均优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: SaFiRe通过两阶段认知建模有效解决了RIS中的指称模糊问题，在复杂表达场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下生态监测需要语义分割，但获取密集专家标注成本高昂。稀疏点标注更容易获得，但面临标注点选择和标签传播的挑战。

Method: 采用主动采样策略指导标注者选择最有价值的点，然后结合SAM2和超像素方法的混合方法传播稀疏标签。

Result: 在两个不同的水下数据集上测试，比最先进方法D+NN提升5% mIoU。

Conclusion: 开发并发布了简单有效的交互式标注工具，使生态研究者能够利用基础模型和计算机视觉高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏可视化解释来定位预测概念，限制了在真实世界特别是高风险医疗场景中的应用。

Method: 提出ViConEx-Med框架，引入多概念可学习token，利用专门的注意力层处理视觉和文本概念token，生成概念级定位映射。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上的实验表明，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度方面优于现有概念模型，与黑盒模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的姿态估计方法，通过预测物体前后表面的3D坐标并进行密集采样，创建超密集的2D-3D对应关系，从而提升基于PnP算法的姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前姿态估计方法主要关注物体前表面的3D坐标预测精度，忽略了利用物体后表面和内部信息的潜力。为了充分利用物体的完整表面和内部信息，本研究探索了前后表面坐标预测的方法。

Method: 预测物体前后表面的3D坐标，在两者之间进行密集采样以创建超密集的2D-3D对应关系，并提出分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)来更准确高效地表示前后表面坐标。

Result: 在BOP网站的七个经典核心数据集上，该方法相比现有SOTA方法表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用物体的完整表面和内部信息，结合提出的HCCE编码方法，能够显著提升姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

Motivation: 无人机视频数据量大但检索困难，现有数据集标注粗糙冗余，需要细粒度标注和专门方法来解决无人机视频的文本检索问题。

Method: 构建DVTMD数据集，提出TCMA框架，包含全局视频-句子对齐、句子引导帧聚合和词引导补丁对齐，并设计了词和补丁选择模块以及文本自适应动态温度机制。

Result: 在DVTMD和CapERA数据集上建立了首个完整的无人机文本-视频检索基准，TCMA实现了45.5%的文本到视频R@1和42.8%的视频到文本R@1，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法有效解决了无人机视频文本检索问题，为相关应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为伪平衡的方法，用于在半监督学习中缓解人脸性别分类模型的偏见问题，通过无标签图像实现人口统计平衡，显著提高了公平性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型经常反映并放大训练数据中的人口统计偏见，导致在不同性别和种族子组中表现不均。需要一种简单有效的方法来缓解这种偏见。

Method: 伪平衡策略，在半监督学习中强制实施人口统计平衡的伪标签选择，仅使用来自种族平衡数据集的无标签图像，无需真实标注。

Result: 该方法在整体准确率上达到79.81%，比基线提高6.53%，性别准确率差距减少44.17%。在东亚子组中，基线差距超过49%，该方法将差距缩小到仅5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计平衡或适度偏斜的无标签数据集可以作为消除现有计算机视觉模型偏见的强大资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

Motivation: 当前方法仅建模成对物体关系，忽略了n元组合在多模态关系理解中的全局感知重要性，导致3D-语言对齐困难。

Method: 扩展关系学习从二元到n元，设计分组监督损失促进n元关系学习，在n元关系场景图中使用混合注意力机制的多模态网络定位目标。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中优于现有最先进方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系学习能有效提升3D物体定位性能，特别是在涉及复杂空间关系的场景中。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: AnomReason和AnomAgent为衡量和改进AI生成图像的语义合理性提供了基础，支持语义真实性和可解释AIGC取证的可复现研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了医学视频建模中零样本能力的出现，突显了通用视频模型作为统一学习器和推理器的潜力，为基于视频模型的未来医学基础模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

### [66] [Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257)
*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个改进3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过使用不透明度梯度作为渲染误差的轻量级代理来替代标准位置梯度启发式，结合更保守的剪枝策略和深度相关损失，显著减少基元数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景中容易过拟合并产生臃肿的重建结果，现有方法如FSGS虽然提高了质量但显著增加了基元数量，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用不透明度梯度作为轻量级渲染误差代理的新型致密化触发器，配合保守的剪枝策略防止破坏性优化循环，并采用标准深度相关损失进行几何指导。

Result: 在3视图LLFF数据集上比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs 57k基元），在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上减少约70%基元数量，在重建质量与效率的帕累托边界上达到新的最优水平。

Conclusion: 该框架通过重新设计3DGS核心优化过程，在保持重建质量的同时显著提高了效率，为少样本视图合成建立了新的质量-效率权衡标准。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator是一个端到端的音频和稀疏手部姿态驱动的人体动画框架，通过预训练手部清晰度码本、双流音频感知模块和姿态校准技巧，解决了现有方法中头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要原因是音频与头部运动相关性弱，以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 1. 预训练手部清晰度码本(HCC)编码高保真手部纹理先验；2. 双流音频感知模块(DSAA)分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3. 姿态校准技巧(PCT)通过放松刚性约束来细化和对齐姿态条件。

Result: 大量实验表明VividAnimator达到最先进性能，生成具有优越手部细节、手势真实性和身份一致性的视频，通过定量指标和定性评估验证。

Conclusion: VividAnimator通过三个关键技术创新有效解决了音频和姿态驱动动画中的关键问题，实现了高质量的人体动画生成。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的方法通常只依赖透视视图或鸟瞰图特征，无法同时利用细粒度目标细节和空间结构化场景表示。

Method: 提出混合检测跟踪框架，结合PV和BEV特征，通过基础模型引导的BEV映射，将DINOv2特征蒸馏到BEV表示中，使用可变形聚合增强3D检测跟踪。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试中达到最先进性能，展示了基础模型BEV映射在自动驾驶感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 融合PV和BEV特征的混合表示能够显著提升3D目标检测与跟踪性能，基础模型BEV映射为实现更可靠的自动驾驶感知提供了新途径。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

Motivation: SAM2虽然在低资源环境下具有快速推理能力，但微调仍然具有挑战性。需要一种参数高效的微调方法来适应眼底图像分割任务。

Method: 将低秩适配器集成到图像编码器和掩码解码器中，使用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络调优。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在跨数据集训练条件下在血管和视盘分割方面表现优异，Dice分数分别达到0.86和0.93，AUC值分别达到0.98和0.99。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA在显著减少训练开销的同时，实现了最先进的性能，为眼底图像分割提供了一种高效的微调解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景（如ScanNet）难以捕捉且数据有限，生成具有多样化对象姿态的真实场景仍然是一个开放且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入分解表示法将场景分解为层次化组织的房间程序和对象姿态概念；学习可重用布局模式的函数库；使用大语言模型生成高级程序；学习程序条件模型来分层预测对象姿态；检索并放置3D对象到场景中。

Result: FactoredScenes生成了难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的逼真现实世界房间。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分解场景表示和程序化生成方法，能够有效合成具有真实感的3D室内场景。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7
percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of
0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的作物健康监测系统受限于稀疏航拍图像数据集的正射影像生成技术限制，传统方法需要70-80%的图像重叠率，而资源受限的AI系统难以达到这一要求

Method: 使用基于光流的框架，通过中间光流估计在连续航拍帧之间合成过渡图像，人工增强特征对应关系以改进几何重建

Result: 实验验证显示最小重叠率要求降低了20%

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse框架能够生成可靠的正射影像，同时分析了精准农业中的采用障碍，为AI驱动监测系统的更好集成提供了路径

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云补全模型在测试时无法适应新的结构模式和传感器引起的失真，限制了在安全关键应用中的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用基于MAML的元辅助学习策略，通过两个自监督辅助目标优化补全模型，并在推理时通过自适应λ校准机制动态调整编码器。

Result: 在合成、模拟和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，PointMAC通过逐个样本细化实现了最先进的高质量补全结果。

Conclusion: 这是首个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作，显著提升了模型对未知结构和传感器失真的适应能力。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了CNN在图像分类中存在的隐藏偏见问题，提出了两种方法来区分上下文信息和背景噪声，并在六个数据集上进行了测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型，其决策过程可能受到难以检测的背景信息偏见影响，需要开发方法来识别这些偏见。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）将图像分割成随机打乱的非重叠小图块；2）应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波器等图像变换来恢复CNN用于分类的背景噪声信息。

Result: 该方法能有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声，即使在没有背景信息的情况下也能检测到背景噪声的存在。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可以有效识别CNN中的数据集偏见，帮助区分真正的上下文学习和背景噪声导致的偏见。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法通常只关注2D或3D单一模态，无法充分捕捉人类行走模式的几何和动态复杂性。

Method: 使用多模态多任务学习策略，结合2D时空轮廓和3D SMPL特征，通过统一transformer融合特征，同时执行步态识别和人体属性估计。

Result: 在具有挑战性的大规模BRIAR数据集上，该方法在步态识别和人体属性估计方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 多模态和多任务学习在现实场景中推进基于步态的人类理解方面具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 使用迁移学习和LSTM网络从VR游戏视频中预测晕动症严重程度，准确率达到68.4%，超越仅基于视频数据的现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR技术在医疗、教育和娱乐等领域的广泛应用，晕动症问题严重阻碍了VR的普及。现有研究多关注多模态深度学习方法，但基于视频特征的晕动症预测研究有限。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，使用在ImageNet数据集上预训练的InceptionV3模型从VR游戏视频中提取高级视觉特征，然后将这些特征输入LSTM网络以捕捉VR体验的时间动态并预测晕动症严重程度。

Result: 该方法有效利用了视频数据的时间序列特性，在晕动症严重程度分类任务上达到了68.4%的准确率，超越了仅基于视频数据的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为VR开发者提供了评估和缓解虚拟环境中晕动症的实用工具，并为未来基于视频的时间建模研究以提升VR应用用户舒适度奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

TL;DR: HuLiRAG框架通过"what-where-reweight"级联方法改进多模态问答，使用开放词汇检测定位候选对象，SAM掩码恢复空间精度，自适应权衡局部与全局对齐，并通过掩码引导微调将空间证据注入生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于对象身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参照物。现有检索增强生成方法缺乏局部细节和细粒度交互推理。

Method: 提出HuLiRAG框架，采用"what-where-reweight"级联：通过开放词汇检测锚定候选参照物，使用SAM掩码进行空间解析恢复精度，自适应权衡局部与全局对齐，并通过掩码引导微调注入空间证据。

Result: 广泛实验表明，这种类人级联方法提高了接地保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG通过模拟人类视觉推理过程，将接地从被动偏置转变为答案制定的显式约束，显著提升了多模态问答的可信度和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个单目SE(3)扩散框架，将无标记、基于图像的机器人姿态估计建模为条件去噪扩散过程，通过可见性约束的扩散过程增强训练数据多样性，并通过时间步感知的反向过程进行渐进式姿态优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定尺度的扰动，无法生成在相机视野内且多样化的训练姿态，限制了网络的泛化能力。需要一种能够确保变换保持在相机视野内并生成多样化训练姿态的方法。

Method: 框架包含两个过程：可见性约束的扩散过程用于多样化姿态增强，时间步感知的反向过程用于渐进式姿态优化。扩散过程逐步扰动真实姿态为噪声变换，反向过程通过去噪网络迭代预测姿态，并按照从粗到细的调度程序进行细化。

Result: 在两个基准测试（DREAM和RoboKeyGen）上均取得改进，在最具挑战性的数据集上实现了66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提高了32.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散过程生成视野内且多样化的训练姿态，提高了网络泛化能力；反向过程的时间步感知细化方案提供了比直接预测更高的鲁棒性，在机器人姿态估计任务中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示的方法在处理一致性异常（相似缺陷在多个图像中重复出现）时性能较差，导致异常分类和分割效果不佳。

Method: 构建图像级图结构，将图像作为节点，通过检测共享一致性异常模式的图像连接边，利用社区检测过滤异常。基于极端值理论提供理论基础，识别"邻居耗尽"现象。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络实现98.3% AUROC的异常分类性能，分割性能达到66.8% F1和68.1% AP，比现有零样本方法分别提升4.2%和5.4%。使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步提升分割性能至69.1% F1和71.9% AP。

Conclusion: CoDeGraph算法能有效检测和过滤一致性异常，在零样本异常检测任务中表现出色，且在不同骨干网络架构下都具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割标注存在标注者间差异问题，传统方法简单平均专家标签会丢弃临床不确定性信息，需要更智能的方法来利用专家分歧。

Method: 开发了群体决策模拟框架，包括专家签名生成器学习个体标注者风格，以及模拟会诊模块从潜在空间智能采样生成最终分割结果。

Result: 在CBCT和MRI数据集上取得了最先进的结果，分别达到92.11%和90.72%的Dice分数。

Conclusion: 通过将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，为构建更稳健和可信的医疗AI系统提供了明确路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Result: 在MultiTIPS数据集上的实验表明该方法优于现有最优方法，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床应用中具有潜力，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

TL;DR: 提出Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG)方法，通过降解视觉-语言注意力来减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题，无需额外训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在严重幻觉问题，倾向于生成与图像无关但语言流畅的响应，主要原因是语言偏见。

Method: 通过自适应掩码最有影响力的图像token的注意力权重来降解视觉-语言感知，利用原始模型与降解后模型输出分布的差异进行解码。

Result: CMG在幻觉特定基准测试中显著提高了不同VLM的性能，有效减少语言偏见而不损害模型能力。

Conclusion: CMG是一种无需训练的解码方法，能有效解决VLM的幻觉问题，具有优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

Motivation: 现有伪图像表示方法在处理非结构化点云时往往忽略点云的结构和语义细节，导致特征融合和区分能力有限。

Method: 1. 全局-局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征相关性并捕获全局上下文信息；2. 多分支特征提取网络捕获更多邻域信息并增强轮廓特征区分能力；3. 深度特征引导注意力机制提升跨通道特征融合精度。

Conclusion: DAGLFNet在保持实时性的同时实现了高精度点云语义分割，展示了在LiDAR实时应用中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

Motivation: 微手势识别需要同时建模长程和局部时空依赖。CNN擅长局部模式但长程依赖有限，Transformer能处理长程依赖但计算成本高，Mamba虽高效但缺乏局部时空建模能力。

Method: 提出MSF-Mamba，在Mamba基础上引入基于中心帧差分的运动感知状态融合模块，捕获局部时空依赖。还提出多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，支持多尺度运动感知状态融合和自适应尺度加权。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知状态融合有效增强了Mamba的局部时空建模能力，在微手势识别任务中实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

*Yunlong Deng,Guangyi Chen,Tianpei Gu,Lingjing Kong,Yan Li,Zeyu Tang,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究验证了视觉语言模型(VLMs)具有内在的自我精炼能力，能够无需外部输入自动生成高质量监督数据并自主学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在无监督指令训练下的潜力，验证其自我精炼能力，以摆脱对外部监督数据的依赖。

Method: 提出基于三角一致性原则的自我精炼框架：1)通过多任务指令调优激活指令生成能力；2)从未标注图像生成图像-查询-答案三元组并用三角一致性过滤；3)使用过滤后的合成数据更新模型。

Result: 以LLaVA-1.5为基线，实验表明模型能在无外部监督下在多个基准测试中实现持续但适度的改进。

Conclusion: VLMs具有自我精炼能力，这一发现可为未来VLM学习机制研究提供启示。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

*Jiaye Li,Baoyou Chen,Hui Li,Zilong Dong,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARoPE是一种针对图像生成任务改进的旋转位置编码方法，通过可学习的线性变换动态调整频率分配和旋转平面对齐，解决了标准RoPE在细粒度空间关系建模、颜色线索和物体计数方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的多维RoPE在图像生成中存在三个关键限制：刚性频率分配、轴间独立性和统一的头处理方式，这导致难以捕捉图像生成所需的复杂结构偏置。

Method: 提出HARoPE，在旋转映射前插入通过奇异值分解参数化的可学习线性变换，实现动态频率重分配、旋转平面语义对齐和头特定的位置感受野，同时严格保持RoPE的相对位置属性。

Result: 在类条件ImageNet和文本到图像生成（Flux和MMDiT）上的广泛实验表明，HARoPE始终优于强RoPE基线和其他扩展方法。

Conclusion: HARoPE可作为有效的即插即用替代方案，为基于Transformer的图像生成模型提供原则性且适应性强的位置感知增强解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D是一个基于多视角扩散的3D风格迁移方法，通过拼图操作解耦风格与内容，实现快速、视角一致的3D资产风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在每场景优化成本高、风格与语义内容纠缠的问题，需要一种能够解耦风格与内容、实现快速风格迁移的方法。

Method: 使用拼图操作（空间打乱和随机掩码参考图像块）来抑制对象语义并分离风格统计特征，通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将风格线索集成到多视角扩散模型中。

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，延迟显著降低，并能泛化到掩码部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成。

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D提供了一种有效的3D风格迁移解决方案，通过解耦风格与内容实现了快速、一致的风格化效果。

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker)框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口，让奖励模型能够主动获取和更新视觉证据，解决了传统多模态奖励模型中视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算和导致幻觉的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型存在两个主要限制：(1)视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算，导致只能使用较少帧数，丢失细粒度细节；(2)所有视觉信息都打包到初始提示中，在链式推理过程中加剧幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 采用强化微调流程：首先使用精心策划的视觉链式思维数据进行冷启动，蒸馏基本推理技能和操作格式化；然后选择所有维度判断都正确的样本进行拒绝采样微调；最后应用组相对策略优化来加强推理能力。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进的准确率，特别是对于较长视频：7B参数的VR-Thinker在VideoGen Reward上达到80.5%，在GenAI-Bench上达到82.3%，在MJ-Bench-Video上达到75.6%。

Conclusion: 结果验证了基于图像思考的多模态奖励建模方法的有效性和前景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种扩展CNN感受野的LUT方法，通过优化格点向量量化器、不规则空洞卷积和U型级联LUT结构，在固定表大小下提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法由于表大小组合爆炸问题，卷积核感受野受限，需要在不增加空间复杂度的前提下扩展感受野。

Method: 学习最优格点向量量化器自适应分配量化分辨率，采用不规则空洞卷积和U型级联LUT结构捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 在保持相同空间复杂度的同时，显著提升了LUT驱动的快速CNN推理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了速度、精度和内存效率，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前开放词汇分割和上下文分割方法在架构差异、学习目标和表示学习策略上的不一致问题，构建统一的模型来处理不同粒度的分割任务。

Method: 利用基础模型提取输入图像和多模态提示（文本和图像）的表示，通过SegDecoder对齐这些表示、建模它们的交互，并获取由输入提示指定的不同粒度的掩码。

Result: 综合实验表明COSINE在开放词汇分割和上下文分割任务上都有显著的性能提升，探索性分析显示视觉和文本提示的协同合作比单模态方法具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: COSINE成功统一了开放词汇分割和上下文分割，克服了先前方法的架构不一致问题，多模态提示的协同使用显著提升了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Motivation: 解决传统车牌识别系统在多样化车牌布局和真实世界挑战性条件下可靠性不足的问题，特别是对噪声、失真和非标准字体的适应性。

Method: 采用高精度检测网络，结合基于transformer的视觉模型和迭代语言建模机制，在统一识别阶段同时进行字符识别和OCR后处理，学习车牌特定的结构模式和格式规则。

Conclusion: 通过在识别阶段嵌入模式分析，将计算机视觉和语言建模相结合，为智能交通和监控应用提供了增强的适应性。

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE)方法来解决多模态学习中模态缺失不平衡的问题，包含学习能力增强和表示能力增强两个组件，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中处理缺失模态，特别是在缺失率不平衡的情况下，是一个主要挑战。这种不平衡会引发恶性循环：缺失率较高的模态更新较少，导致学习进度不一致和表示退化。现有方法通常关注全局数据集级平衡，忽略了模态效用的样本级变化和特征质量退化问题。

Method: MCE包含两个协同组件：1) 学习能力增强(LCE)，通过多级因素动态平衡模态特定学习进度；2) 表示能力增强(RCE)，通过子集预测和跨模态补全任务提升特征语义和鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估表明，MCE在各种缺失配置下始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MCE通过同时解决学习进度不平衡和表示质量退化问题，有效提升了多模态学习在缺失模态情况下的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

TL;DR: GLOFNet是一个用于冰川湖溃决洪水监测和预测的多模态数据集，整合了Sentinel-2多光谱影像、NASA冰川速度数据和MODIS地表温度记录，旨在解决数据碎片化和单模态问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川湖溃决洪水是高山地区罕见但破坏性强的灾害，现有研究主要关注事后制图，而预测需要结合视觉指标和物理前兆的协调数据集。

Method: 整合三种互补数据源：Sentinel-2多光谱影像用于空间监测、NASA ITS_LIVE速度产品用于冰川运动学、MODIS地表温度记录；进行云掩膜、质量过滤、归一化、时间插值、数据增强和循环编码等预处理。

Conclusion: GLOFNet通过解决类别不平衡、云污染和粗分辨率等挑战，为罕见灾害预测的多模态深度学习方法提供了结构化基准基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters

that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and

Motivation: 现有统一tokenizer在视觉理解和生成任务之间存在显著性能权衡，因为高层语义抽象与低层像素重建存在内在冲突。

Method: 采用层自适应自蒸馏技术继承预训练视觉编码器的语义特征，并提出轻量级patch-wise像素流解码器进行高效像素重建。

Conclusion: UniFlow通过语义特征作为视觉条件有效缓解了理解与生成之间的训练冲突，实现了高性能的通用视觉建模。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

*Shizhen Zhao,Jiahui Liu,Xin Wen,Haoru Tan,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了预训练视觉基础模型在OOD检测中的应用，发现DINOv2模型无需微调即可提供高度判别性的特征空间。针对大语义空间场景，提出了MoFE模块和Dynamic-β Mixup策略来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉基础模型在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其在OOD检测任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在系统研究这些模型在OOD检测中的应用价值。

Method: 1) 评估预训练DINOv2模型在OOD检测中的表现；2) 提出Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE)模块，将特征划分为子空间以捕获复杂数据分布；3) 引入Dynamic-β Mixup策略，根据类别学习难度动态调整插值权重。

Result: 预训练DINOv2模型无需微调即可达到现有SOTA方法的性能。提出的MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup策略在大语义空间场景中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉基础模型为OOD检测提供了强大的特征表示能力，而MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup策略有效解决了大语义空间下的优化挑战，显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

*Jingchao Wang,Wenlong Zhang,Dingjiang Huang,Hong Wang,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FSVG方法，通过特征选择机制直接整合语言和视觉模态，避免复杂迭代过程，在视觉定位任务中实现精度和效率的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要在不同图像尺度上迭代执行，且每次迭代都需要缓存语言和视觉特征，带来额外计算开销。为了简化实现，需要一种更高效的视觉定位方法。

Method: FSVG方法：1）直接将语言和视觉模态封装到整体网络架构中，避免复杂迭代；2）使用语言作为指导并行促进语言模态和视觉模态的交互；3）引入基于相似度的特征选择机制，仅利用语言相关的视觉特征进行快速预测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FSVG在精度和效率之间达到了比当前最先进方法更好的平衡。

Conclusion: FSVG是一种简单而有效的视觉定位基线方法，通过特征选择机制显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSurf是一种统一的后训练范式，结合了监督微调(SFT)和基于可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)的优势，通过将真实标签注入RLVR过程，同时提供外部监督和内部强化，在多个基准测试中表现优于单独使用SFT、RLVR以及两阶段SFT→RLVR方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法往往导致次优性能，而RLVR在处理超出模型内部知识库的任务时表现不佳。需要一种能够结合两者优势的统一训练范式。

Method: 提出ViSurf统一后训练范式，通过分析SFT和RLVR目标推导出ViSurf目标，将真实标签注入RLVR过程，并引入三种新的奖励控制策略来稳定和优化训练过程。

Result: 在多个多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ViSurf在性能上优于单独的SFT、RLVR以及两阶段SFT→RLVR方法。

Conclusion: ViSurf通过统一SFT和RLVR的优势，提供了一种更有效的后训练范式，深度分析验证了其推导和设计原则的有效性。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要统一框架来处理多任务质量评估。

Method: 构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，通过拒绝采样获取信息丰富的规划-推理轨迹，形成链式思维数据集用于监督微调。采用GRPO进行后训练，使用高斯奖励支持连续分数预测，并加入标准差过滤和熵门控机制稳定训练。

Conclusion: OmniQuality-R框架能够有效处理多任务质量推理，提供连续可解释的奖励信号，并通过稳定化技术提高训练效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性注意力模型由于低秩投影结构和过于均匀的注意力分布，导致表达能力显著下降，限制了模型的分类能力。

Method: 在值矩阵上附加门控局部图网络分支以增加注意力图的秩；在注意力分数中引入可学习的对数幂函数来降低熵并锐化注意力焦点。

Result: 在同类性和异类性图基准测试中，该方法实现了有竞争力的性能，同时保持了线性注意力的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了线性注意力机制的表达能力不足问题，在保持计算效率的同时提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

TL;DR: FS-VFM是一个自监督预训练框架，通过3C学习目标（一致性、连贯性、对应性）结合掩码图像建模和实例判别，学习真实人脸的基础表示，并在多种人脸安全任务中展现出优异的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大量未标记的真实人脸数据，学习鲁棒且可迁移的人脸表示，以提升在各种人脸安全任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出FS-VFM框架，包含三种学习目标：使用CRFR-P掩码策略实现区域一致性和跨区域连贯性；通过自蒸馏机制结合掩码图像建模和实例判别建立局部到全局的对应关系；使用FS-Adapter轻量适配器进行高效迁移。

Conclusion: FS-VFM能够学习到通用的人脸基础表示，在多种人脸安全任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，且通过轻量适配器实现了高效的迁移学习。

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

Motivation: 现有方法只能单独处理散焦模糊或运动模糊，缺乏同时处理两者的能力。虽然两者都可建模为模糊核卷积，但准确估计模糊核的困难限制了该方向进展

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够有效处理单目视频中的散焦模糊和运动模糊，生成高质量的新视角合成结果

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现主动式VR系统，预测用户行为并相应调整虚拟环境，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Motivation: 水下视频监测是评估海洋生物多样性的有前景策略，但海量无事件视频使得人工检查非常不切实际。

Method: 引入AURA多标注者基准数据集，评估四种基于深度神经网络的水下视觉异常检测模型，采用鲁棒的帧选择策略提取有意义的视频片段。

Result: 当前VAD模型性能差异显著，对训练数据量和正常场景视觉内容变异性高度敏感。软标签和共识标签具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 为支持科学探索和可扩展的生物多样性监测提供了实用方法，强调了多标注者基准的重要性。

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过局部可加性解释实现了高精度的人脸验证，同时提供了内在的可解释性。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持临床部署兼容性的同时，有效解决了3D胸部CT多标签分类的挑战，并展示了在放射学报告生成和腹部CT数据上的更广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下图像合成中由于颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象导致的风格变化问题，传统生成模型难以建模不同水下环境的非均匀条件。

Method: 使用K-means聚类将数据集划分为风格特定域，采用分离编码器获取风格和内容的潜在空间，通过AdaIN整合潜在表示并解码生成最终图像，在每个风格聚类上独立训练以保持域特定特征。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN框架成功实现了高质量的水下图像合成，通过风格-内容解耦和聚类特定训练策略有效捕捉了不同水下环境的风格变化。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

Conclusion: imHead为3D面部操作提供可解释解决方案，支持用户进行局部编辑，推动了大规模3D头部建模的发展。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

Motivation: 高质量的公开分割注释数据集对于图像处理领域至关重要，特别是针对大量目标的体积图像标注既耗时又具有挑战性。现有公开数据集中缺乏完整的三维时间序列细胞迁移分割注释。

Method: 三位不同的标注者对来自细胞追踪挑战赛(CTC)的两个MDA231人类乳腺癌细胞序列进行了完整的三维时间序列分割标注。

Result: 创建的注释与CTC先前发布的追踪标记一致，基于CTC二维黄金标准的测量精度在标注者间变异范围内。与CTC自动生成的银标准相比，所提出的注释更好地反映了输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该数据集可用于测试和训练细胞分割算法，或分析高度动态物体的三维形状，为相关研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

TL;DR: 提出了两种3D人体网格恢复的合并策略：误差约束层合并和掩码引导令牌合并，结合扩散解码器，在多个基准测试中实现2.3倍加速且性能略有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型虽然性能强大，但存在计算成本高和复杂度大的问题，主要源于深层transformer架构和冗余令牌。

Method: 1. 误差约束层合并(ECLM)：选择性合并对MPJPE影响最小的transformer层；2. 掩码引导令牌合并(Mask-ToMe)：专注于合并对最终预测贡献小的背景令牌；3. 扩散解码器：结合时间上下文并利用从大规模运动捕捉数据集中学习的姿态先验。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法实现了高达2.3倍的加速，同时性能相比基线略有提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的合并策略和扩散解码器有效解决了transformer-based HMR模型的计算效率问题，在保持甚至提升性能的同时显著加速推理过程。

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

*Zhaofang Qian,Hardy Chen,Zeyu Wang,Li Zhang,Zijun Wang,Xiaoke Huang,Hui Liu,Xianfeng Tang,Zeyu Zheng,Haoqin Tu,Cihang Xie,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EarthWhere是一个用于评估视觉语言模型图像地理定位能力的综合基准，包含810张全球分布图像，分为国家级别和街道级别的定位任务。评估了13个最先进的VLM模型，发现Gemini-2.5-Pro表现最佳，准确率达56.32%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型发展迅速，但其在开放世界条件下进行图像地理定位的能力尚未得到全面评估，而这一任务在现实生活中具有挑战性和需求。

Method: 构建EarthWhere基准，包含810张全球分布图像，分为WhereCountry（500个选择题，国家级别）和WhereStreet（310个街道级别任务，需要多步推理）。采用最终预测指标和中间推理链评分方法，包括人类验证的关键视觉线索和Shapley重加权思维评分。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro达到最佳平均准确率56.32%，最强开源模型GLM-4.5V达到34.71%。网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时不能保证性能提升，模型存在区域偏见，某些区域得分比其他区域高42.7%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在减轻偏见和实现稳健、细粒度定位方面的持续挑战，同时也展示了其潜力。基准已开源。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

### [133] [Topological Alignment of Shared Vision-Language Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10889)
*Junwon You,Dasol Kang,Jae-Hun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToMCLIP是一个拓扑感知的多语言CLIP框架，通过拓扑保持约束来对齐嵌入空间，解决了多语言视觉语言模型中的跨模态对齐偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比视觉语言模型在跨模态对齐上存在英语偏向，多语言扩展方法虽然缓解了这个问题，但只关注实例级对齐而忽略了共享嵌入空间的全局几何结构。

Method: 提出拓扑对齐框架ToMCLIP，应用持久同调定义拓扑对齐损失，使用图稀疏化策略近似持久图，并提供了理论误差界限。

Result: 实验验证了该方法能增强多语言表示的结构一致性，在CIFAR-100上获得更高的零样本准确率，在xFlickr&CO上实现更强的多语言检索性能。

Conclusion: ToMCLIP不仅提升了多语言视觉语言模型的性能，还为表示学习中的拓扑对齐提供了一种通用方法。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

*Honghui Yuan,Keiji Yanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SceneTextStylizer，一种无需训练的基于扩散模型的框架，用于场景图像中文本的灵活高保真风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单样式，缺乏自由风格迁移能力，无法实现灵活和局部化的文本风格编辑。

Method: 设计特征注入模块利用扩散模型反演和自注意力机制有效迁移风格特征；引入基于距离变化掩码的区域控制机制实现精确空间控制；基于傅里叶变换的风格增强模块强化风格丰富度。

Result: 在场景文本风格转换方面实现卓越性能，在视觉保真度和文本保持方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现文本区域的提示引导风格转换，同时保持文本可读性和风格一致性，解决了场景文本灵活局部化风格编辑的挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

Motivation: 尽管GAN在虚拟化妆模拟技术中取得进展，但仍面临训练不稳定和定制能力有限等挑战，需要开发更可控、精确的实图编辑方法。

Method: 采用免训练的扩散模型方法，使用早期停止的DDIM反演技术来保持面部结构和身份，支持多种条件输入（参考图像、RGB颜色、文本描述）进行定制化化妆。

Result: 相比现有的GAN基和扩散基框架，在定制化能力、色彩匹配、身份保持以及与文本描述或LLMs的兼容性方面均有显著提升，且计算成本合理。

Conclusion: DreamMakeup通过扩散模型的优势解决了GAN方法的局限性，为虚拟化妆定制提供了更可控、精确且多功能的解决方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled
advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led
by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including
training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these
challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model
based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of
diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.
DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial
structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various
conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual
descriptions. Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing
GAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization,
color-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with
textual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，通过细粒度监督和多种判别目标，在英语和中文上实现了先进的细粒度对齐能力，并在29个数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度理解方面存在局限，特别是在非英语环境下。CLIP等模型在全局对齐上表现良好，但在对象属性、空间关系和语言表达的细粒度细节捕捉上表现不足，且双语理解支持有限。

Method: 采用丰富的细粒度监督（包括区域-文本匹配和长文本建模）和多种判别目标，引入文本模态内对比损失（TIC）来更好地区分语义相似的描述，并在大规模英语和中文数据上进行训练。

Result: 在29个数据集、8个任务上的广泛实验表明，FG-CLIP 2超越了现有方法，在两种语言上都取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2通过细粒度对齐方法显著提升了双语视觉语言理解能力，为未来的双语细粒度对齐研究提供了模型、代码和基准数据集。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

### [137] [Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需校准的实例级不确定性指标，用于检测生成模型在逆问题重建中的分布偏移，通过测量重建稳定性来识别超出训练分布的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型作为数据驱动先验在逆问题中表现出色，但当测试图像超出训练分布时可能产生幻觉特征。现有不确定性量化方法需要校准数据集、提供启发式估计或无法专门检测分布偏移。

Method: 基于假设：在分布内图像的重建在随机测量变化下保持稳定，而超出分布图像的重建表现出更大不稳定性。通过计算重建稳定性作为分布偏移的代理指标。

Result: 在MNIST数字的断层重建实验中，仅使用数字"0"训练的学习近端网络评估所有十个数字。超出分布数字的重建显示出更高的变异性和重建误差，验证了该指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该指标为生成先验提供了轻量级防护机制，可在分布内情况下实现激进测量减少，同时自动警告先验被应用于超出分布的情况。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IUT-Plug是一个基于图像理解树(IUT)的模块，通过显式结构化推理增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、对象身份和风格方面的上下文漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图像-文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格的一致性，这限制了其在复杂图像-文本输入输出场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：(1)动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为层次符号结构；(2)协调的叙述流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，IUT-Plug不仅提高了现有基准测试的准确性，还能有效缓解三种关键形式的上下文漂移问题。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过结构化推理有效解决了视觉语言模型中的上下文漂移问题，提升了多模态问答场景中的性能。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR是一个通过可验证奖励和GRPO微调LVLMs的框架，旨在提高图表推理的鲁棒性和可解释性，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在分布外数据上表现不佳，且在生成思维链推理时性能进一步下降，限制了可解释性。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)结合三个自动可验证奖励：正确图表类型分类、忠实图表表格重建和过程一致性。

Result: 在3B参数LVLMs上，Chart-RVR在分布内外数据集上均优于标准监督微调，缩小了OOD性能差距，提高了推理保真度，在六个图表推理基准测试中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR通过可验证奖励和GRPO训练出了可靠、可解释的图表推理模型，增强了信任和可靠性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出了Multimodal Mixup (MM)和Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM)方法，通过在多模态特征层面应用Mixup策略来缓解强模态主导学习的问题，提高多模态模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态视频理解中，模型容易过度拟合强模态，导致弱模态的贡献被抑制，影响模型性能。

Method: 首先提出MM在多模态聚合特征层面应用Mixup生成虚拟特征-标签对；然后提出B-MM根据各模态对学习目标的相对贡献动态调整混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，这些方法能有效提高模型的泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的MM和B-MM方法能够有效缓解多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and

TL;DR: ContextGen是一个用于多实例图像生成的Diffusion Transformer框架，通过布局和参考图像引导，解决了现有扩散模型在多实例生成中对象布局控制和身份保持的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中存在关键限制，难以实现精确的对象布局控制和保持多个不同主体的身份一致性。

Method: 提出ContextGen框架，包含两个关键技术：Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA)机制将复合布局图像融入生成上下文以锚定对象位置；Identity Consistency Attention (ICA)注意力机制利用上下文参考图像确保多实例的身份一致性。同时构建了IMIG-100K数据集。

Result: 广泛实验表明ContextGen在控制精度、身份保真度和整体视觉质量方面优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: ContextGen通过创新的CLA和ICA机制，结合大规模数据集IMIG-100K，成功解决了多实例图像生成的挑战，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在复杂低对比度背景下难以聚焦前景区域，特别是当恶性肿瘤与正常器官相似时，上下文区分变得困难。

Method: 1) 前景感知模块放大背景与整体空间差异；2) 基于小波变换的特征级频率增强模块提取高频特征；3) 边缘约束模块保持分割边界的几何连续性。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上的广泛实验显示，所有指标均表现优异，特别是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了低对比度图像的分割效果，为更复杂多样的医学成像场景应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Result: 在四个组合性基准测试（Winoground、EqBench、ColorSwap、SugarCrepe）和七个不同规模的开源VLM上，COCO-Tree相比基线显著提升了组合泛化能力5-10%。

Conclusion: COCO-Tree通过神经符号概念树有效提升了视觉语言模型的组合推理性能，同时提供了预测背后的推理依据。

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的框架，通过全局时空Mamba和局部细化Mamba分别学习高分辨率时空表示，用于视频人体姿态估计，在保持线性复杂度的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VHPE方法难以平衡全局动态上下文和局部运动细节建模，且存在二次复杂度问题。Mamba模型在长序列建模方面表现出色但仅限于1D数据。

Method: 提出全局时空Mamba进行6D选择性时空扫描和调制合并，以及基于窗口时空扫描的局部细化Mamba来增强关键点高频细节。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该模型优于现有最先进的VHPE方法，同时实现了更好的计算权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将Mamba扩展到高分辨率时空建模，解决了VHPE中全局与局部建模的平衡问题，且计算效率更高。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

TL;DR: 提出GeoVLMath模型，通过文本描述辅助线构造而非图像编辑，利用强化学习增强图文对齐，在几何辅助线推理任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在处理几何辅助线时面临挑战，图像编辑方法难以保证几何精度，因此转向文本描述方式以更好地利用模型表征能力。

Method: 提出强化学习框架，通过跨模态奖励评估辅助线描述与真实辅助线图的对齐程度，构建GeoVLMath模型，采用GRPO强化学习实现精确的图文对齐。

Result: 在3B和7B规模上，GeoVLMath在辅助线推理基准测试中表现优于开源和专有大视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 文本描述辅助线构造结合强化学习的图文对齐方法，能有效提升大视觉语言模型在复杂几何问题中的推理能力。

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: GIR-Bench是一个全面的多模态基准测试，用于评估统一模型在理解与生成一致性、推理驱动的文本到图像生成以及多步推理编辑三个方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评估多模态模型理解与生成对齐及其在复杂视觉任务中泛化能力的基准测试。

Method: 设计了三个互补视角的评估：理解-生成一致性、推理驱动的文本到图像生成、多步推理编辑，并为每个子集定制了专门评估流程。

Result: 统一模型在推理驱动的视觉任务中表现更好，但理解与生成之间仍存在显著差距。

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为系统评估多模态模型提供了重要工具，揭示了理解与生成之间的对齐挑战。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG)模块，协作使用CLIP和SAM生成正负点提示，引导SAM专注于异常区域分割；2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS)模块，使用混合提示与SAM的轻量级解码器级联，实现异常区域的精确分割。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的零样本异常分割结果，特别是在Visa数据集上，F1-max和AP指标分别比现有最佳方法高出10.3%和7.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合了CLIP和SAM的优势，在零样本异常分割任务中取得了显著性能提升，证明了协作使用基础模型的可行性。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

Motivation: 喉癌影像研究缺乏标准化数据集来支持可复现的深度学习模型开发。

Method: 从TCIA六个数据集中收集1,029个CT扫描，使用弱监督参数搜索框架提取喉部感兴趣区域，并评估了多种3D深度学习架构（3D CNN、ResNet18/50/101、DenseNet121）。

Result: 3D CNN在早期vs晚期分类任务中表现最佳（AUC-0.881，F1-macro-0.821），ResNet18在T4 vs非T4分类中表现最佳（AUC-0.892，F1-macro-0.646）。

Conclusion: LaryngealCT通过开源数据、预训练模型和可解释性工具，为AI驱动的喉癌研究提供了可复现的基础，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for
AI-driven research to support clinical decisions in laryngeal oncology.

Motivation: 现有文本引导扩散模型在真实人脸编辑任务中难以保持身份和结构一致性，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 将人脸表示分解为身份和属性特征，作为联合条件指导反演和反向扩散过程，实现身份和属性的独立控制。

Result: 支持仅使用文本提示的复杂多属性人脸编辑，无需区域特定输入，速度与DDIM反演相当，实验证明其实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持身份一致性的同时实现了精确的面部属性操控，为真实人脸编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 为野外环境下的弹性、语言感知视频分割指明未来发展方向。

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Motivation: 现有无源目标检测方法主要针对传统检测模型如Faster R-CNN，缺乏专门为DETR等新型检测器架构设计的适配方案，需要开发专门针对DETR的无源目标检测框架。

Method: FRANCK包含四个核心组件：基于目标性得分的样本重加权模块、基于匹配记忆库的对比学习模块、不确定性加权的查询融合特征蒸馏模块，以及改进的自训练流程。

Conclusion: FRANCK框架有效将源域预训练的DETR模型适配到目标域，具有增强的鲁棒性和泛化能力，与基于DETR的无源目标检测模型具有良好的兼容性。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖当前场景上下文，低估了场景动态性和时间演化的重要性，限制了在复杂驾驶场景中的适应性决策能力。

Method: 引入SeerDrive框架，包含两个关键组件：(1) 未来感知规划，将预测的BEV特征注入轨迹规划器；(2) 迭代场景建模和车辆规划，通过协作优化同时改进未来场景预测和轨迹生成。

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SeerDrive显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 自动驾驶车辆的未来轨迹与环境动态演化紧密交织，双向关系建模能够实现更智能和自适应的决策。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪为多模态防御提供了有效解决方案，有助于多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠安全部署。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是第一篇专门针对组合零样本学习的全面综述论文，系统回顾了该领域的最新方法，提出了基于解缠的四种方法分类，并分析了不同问题设置下的优势和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习是计算机视觉中的重要任务，能够识别已知属性和对象在推理时的未见组合，解决需要为所有可能组合提供训练数据的组合挑战。由于原始特征的视觉外观具有高度上下文依赖性，有效建模这种上下文性和内在组合性对于稳健的组合零样本识别至关重要。

Method: 提出了基于解缠的分类法，将方法分为四类：无显式解缠、文本解缠、视觉解缠和跨模态解缠。对现有方法进行了详细的比较分析，重点关注它们在封闭世界和开放世界CZSL等不同问题设置中的核心优势和局限性。

Result: 建立了首个专门的CZSL综述框架，提供了方法分类和比较分析，识别了该领域最重要的开放挑战，并概述了有前景的未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本综述旨在作为基础资源，指导和启发这一重要领域未来的进一步发展，为研究人员提供了系统的方法分类和问题分析框架。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从真实视频中学习3D运动先验的方法，使用像素对齐的运动图表示，通过扩散模型生成语义一致的3D场景运动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张输入图像预测未来3D场景运动的挑战，需要学习语义和功能上有意义的3D运动先验。

Method: 提出像素对齐的运动图表示，从5万多个真实视频创建大规模MoMap数据库，并训练扩散模型进行运动生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够生成合理且语义一致的3D场景运动。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能够合成3D轨迹，还提出了一种新的2D视频合成流程：先生成MoMap，然后根据运动图扭曲图像并完成渲染。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

*Chen Liu,Wenfang Yao,Kejing Yin,William K. Cheung,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro框架通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，解决纵向多模态数据中的冗余和时序不对齐问题，在疾病进展识别和ICU预测任务上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多模态数据（如电子健康记录和连续胸片）对疾病进展建模至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床意义动态）以及稀疏、不规则成像与连续EHR数据之间的时序不对齐。

Method: DiPro框架采用区域感知解耦方法，将序列CXR中的静态（解剖结构）和动态（病理进展）特征分离，优先考虑疾病相关变化；然后通过局部（成对间隔级别）和全局（完整序列）同步，分层对齐这些静态和动态CXR特征与异步EHR数据，以建模一致的进展路径。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiPro能够有效提取时序临床动态，在疾病进展识别和一般ICU预测任务上均达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架通过解决多模态数据中的关键挑战，成功实现了对疾病进展的有效建模，为纵向临床数据分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

TL;DR: SynTrans是一个新颖的小样本学习框架，通过从大型多模态模型转移多样化和互补的知识来增强现成的小样本学习器，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本学习中由于训练样本有限导致的分类挑战，同时避免传统方法中因数据简单性引入的噪声和偏差。

Method: 使用CLIP作为强教师模型，小样本视觉编码器作为弱学生模型，通过无监督代理任务进行语义对齐的视觉知识蒸馏；包含训练无关的协同知识挖掘模块、视觉-语义桥接模块、视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器。

Result: 在四个小样本学习数据集上的实验结果表明，即使使用简单的小样本视觉编码器，SynTrans也显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过有效的多模态知识转移，成功提升了小样本学习的性能，证明了从大型多模态模型转移知识的有效性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中难以准确遵循计数指令，研究发现单纯扩大模型和数据规模无法解决此问题，而是需要控制噪声先验中的布局信息来改善计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成文本提示中指定的对象数量，因为现有模型在计数方面表现不佳。

Method: 构建了两个合成数据集进行评测，分析扩散模型依赖噪声初始化而非文本提示的问题，并提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知的布局信息来控制对象数量。

Result: 提出的方法显著提高了计数准确性，在GrayCount250数据集上从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6数据集上从74.8%提升到86.3%。

Conclusion: 单纯扩大模型规模无法解决计数问题，关键在于控制噪声先验中的布局信息，该方法在不同设置下都能有效泛化。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

*Guangzhi Sun,Yixuan Li,Xiaodong Wu,Yudong Yang,Wei Li,Zejun Ma,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了video-SALMONN S，首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1FPS、360p分辨率）的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过测试时训练内存模块和提示相关内存读取器解决长视频处理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展到长视频流处理，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法会因合并或丢弃token而丢失信息。

Method: 引入测试时训练(TTT)内存模块持续更新token表示来捕捉长程依赖，以及提示相关内存读取器从固定大小内存中选择性检索相关内容，使用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化TTT模块。

Result: 在长视频基准测试中，8B参数模型在包含10k帧和1M token的多小时视频上保持高质量理解，在Video-MME长分割上达到67.8%的准确率，优于离线和流式基线方法。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S是首个能在固定内存预算下处理超长视频的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过创新的内存管理机制实现了长视频的高质量理解。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精液分析无法评估精子DNA碎片化(SDF)，这是男性生育能力评估的关键参数。需要一种非破坏性的实时检测方法来改善生殖医学中的精子选择。

Method: 结合图像处理技术和基于transformer的机器学习模型(GC-ViT)，提出形态辅助集成AI模型，利用精子形态与DNA完整性之间的已知关联，从相位对比图像预测DNA碎片化。

Result: 该框架实现了60%的敏感性和75%的特异性，基准测试显示优于纯transformer视觉模型和仅形态模型。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了生殖医学的重要进展，能够基于DNA完整性进行实时精子选择，适用于临床诊断和治疗应用。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMEFnet方法，通过多流形证据融合有效结合PolSAR协方差矩阵和多特征，解决传统融合方法忽略流形差异和不确定性的问题，实现更可靠可解释的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PolSAR特征融合方法简单拼接或深度学习结合，忽略了协方差矩阵和多特征位于不同流形结构的问题，且未考虑各视图重要性差异和不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 将协方差矩阵建模在HPD流形上，多特征建模在Grassmann流形上，构建两个核度量学习网络学习流形表示，然后用可信多视图证据融合估计置信质量并量化不确定性，最后基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet成功将PolSAR流形学习与证据融合统一到一个框架中，实现了更可靠和可解释的PolSAR图像分类。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的位置感知模型，通过可微分的热图将语言推理与分割任务连接起来，提高了可解释性并实现了更精确的分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器或用文本表示位置，限制了可解释性和语义细节。

Method: 使用可学习的集中令牌聚合图像和推理文本特征，生成可微分的位置先验热图，通过轻量级解码器解码为精确掩码。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，CoPRS达到或超过了现有最佳指标，热图质量与掩码质量密切相关。

Conclusion: 该范式成功连接了推理和分割，在推理驱动的集中性和掩码预测精度方面显示出优势。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

TL;DR: PICO是一个新颖的跨模态对齐框架，通过抑制嵌入交互中的风格干扰来提高对齐性能。该方法量化特征列表示语义信息的概率，并将其作为嵌入交互的权重，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了非语义信息（风格变化）的影响，这会导致信息偏差或丢失。需要分离风格和语义信息，但现有方法基于特征列进行区分，无法表示语义和风格信息之间的复杂耦合关系。

Method: 提出PICO框架，通过量化每个特征列表示语义信息的概率，并将其作为嵌入交互的权重。采用原型迭代构建方法确保语义概率的可靠性，核心是基于性能反馈的加权函数，理论上证明该函数能为带来更高性能提升的原型分配更高权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干网络上进行的广泛实验表明，PICO优于最先进的方法，性能提升幅度为5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过有效抑制风格干扰，显著提升了跨模态对齐的性能，证明了在嵌入交互中考虑语义概率权重的重要性。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

Motivation: 千亿级病理基础模型虽然性能优秀，但计算成本过高，难以实际应用。需要找到一种参数和数据高效的方法来达到类似性能水平。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，将千亿级教师模型的能力转移到参数少得多的大型学生模型上，仅需目标癌症的1000张病理切片进行训练。

Result: 蒸馏后的大型模型不仅超越了同规模的最先进模型，在某些基准测试中甚至超过了千亿级教师模型和更大规模的模型，并表现出更高的鲁棒性指数。

Conclusion: 该蒸馏方法是一种参数和数据高效的方式，可以在不产生过高计算负担的情况下，为癌症特定应用实现千亿级性能水平。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，涵盖语言重述和视觉模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，其理解文化情境知识的能力变得至关重要，但现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立的视觉基础，未能评估模型是否具备鲁棒且可迁移的文化理解能力。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选格式：文本基线、倒置文本变体和VQA风格版本，包含4,916张图像和21,000多个多选题实例，并通过人工标注验证。

Result: BLEnD-Vis揭示了当前VLM文化知识的显著脆弱性；模型在语言重述下表现下降，虽然视觉线索通常有助于性能，但低跨模态一致性突显了在鲁棒整合文本和视觉理解方面的挑战，特别是对于资源较少的地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，暴露了局限性并指导开发更具文化能力的VLM。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用T5模型进行沙特手语翻译，通过预训练在YouTubeASL数据集上显著提升了沙特手语翻译性能（BLEU-4指标约提升3倍），证明了手语模型的跨语言可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用大规模美国手语数据来改进沙特手语翻译系统，解决沙特手语特有的挑战（如面部遮盖），并验证手语模型的跨语言迁移能力。

Method: 使用T5模型进行沙特手语翻译，比较了在YouTubeASL数据集上预训练的模型与直接在沙特手语数据集上训练的模型性能。

Result: 预训练在YouTubeASL上的模型性能显著优于直接训练的模型，BLEU-4指标提升了约3倍，证明了跨语言迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: 利用大规模美国手语数据进行预训练可以有效提升沙特手语翻译性能，为开发更有效的手语翻译系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FlexAC框架，通过调节多模态大语言模型的联想推理强度，在忠实性和创造性之间实现灵活平衡。该方法利用幻觉诱导的中间表示构建联想导向向量，在创造任务上实现5.8倍提升，幻觉率降低29%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法缺乏调节联想推理强度的灵活性，限制了模型在事实性和创造性场景间的适应性。需要一种能够灵活控制联想推理的机制。

Method: FlexAC框架：1) 发现中层在联想行为中的关键作用；2) 利用幻觉诱导中间表示编码联想方向；3) 选择高联想实例构建联想导向向量；4) 自适应校准向量强度平衡创造性与稳定性；5) 引入任务特定联想向量适应不同创造性任务。

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexAC通过灵活控制联想推理强度，有效解决了MLLM在忠实性和创造性之间的权衡问题，提升了模型在多样化任务中的适应性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着儿童早期在线媒体消费的增长，需要数据驱动工具帮助教育工作者筛选适合年轻学习者的教育内容。

Method: 采用基于类别原型的监督对比学习方法，结合多模态transformer网络捕捉视频中的视觉和音频线索交互，处理细粒度多标签分类问题。

Result: 在APPROVE数据集（193小时专家标注视频，19个类别）上，该方法优于Youtube-8M和COIN等基准。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态对比学习方法能有效检测在线视频中的教育内容，为儿童教育内容筛选提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 探索面部表情动态特征是否包含足够的身份识别信息，独立于静态面部外观，这对社交感知和临床评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态参数，仅保留表情和下巴系数。采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行1,429路分类。

Result: 在CANDOR数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率，是随机猜测的458倍。引入漂移噪声比(DNR)量化形状-表情分离的可靠性，发现DNR与识别性能呈强负相关。

Conclusion: 面部动态特征携带强烈的身份特征，在自然对话中具有个体特异性，这一发现对社交感知和临床评估有重要启示。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

Motivation: 当前医学图像分割方法在结构表示和上下文建模方面存在不足，影响在复杂临床场景中的泛化能力。

Method: DTEA模型包含STR模块（将多尺度语义特征重组为动态超图以建模跨分辨率解剖依赖）和EPG模块（通过扰动评估通道稳定性并过滤高熵通道来增强空间注意力）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的分割精度和更好的跨临床场景泛化能力。

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过改进的跳跃连接框架有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

Conclusion: 该自动化方法显著提高了SEM图像中尺度条检测和提取的效率和准确性，为显微分析提供了有价值的工具，推动了科学成像领域的发展。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

Motivation: 现有图像分类器在训练后难以进行后验编辑，特别是在遗忘特定类别或适应分布变化方面。现有方法要么局限于错误修正，要么需要大量重新训练，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 引入Class Vectors概念，在微调过程中捕获类别特定的表示调整。与任务向量在权重空间编码任务级变化不同，Class Vectors在潜在空间中解耦每个类别的适应过程。

Result: Class Vectors能够捕获每个类别的语义偏移，支持通过引导潜在特征或映射到权重空间来更新决策边界。其固有的线性和正交性支持通过简单的类别算术实现高效的概念编辑。

Conclusion: Class Vectors为图像分类器编辑提供了灵活高效的解决方案，在遗忘学习、环境适应、对抗防御和对抗触发器优化等应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

TL;DR: HaDola是一个人类不确定性感知的数据选择和自动标注框架，通过四阶段流程减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖，使视觉语言模型更准确且校准更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集存在人类不确定性（HU）——人类标注信心的变化，但标准监督微调仅优化最频繁标签，忽略了HU分布。这引发了两个问题：HU如何影响SFT，以及如何在训练中有效利用HU。

Method: HaDola框架包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练，通过迭代识别有害样本、优先选择信息丰富的样本，并从少量种子数据（5%数据）进行自举学习。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上的广泛实验表明，HaDola使用更少的训练数据，始终匹配或优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在SFT中明确建模HU的重要性，表明更好地利用HU比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为ΔEnergy的新型OOD检测分数，通过重新对齐视觉-语言模态来显著提升OOD检测性能，并同时改善协变量偏移下的OOD泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，视觉语言模型(VLMs)会同时遇到分布内(ID)数据和分布外(OOD)数据，包括协变量偏移和语义偏移。需要提升VLMs对协变量偏移OOD数据的泛化能力，同时有效检测开放集语义偏移OOD类别。

Method: 基于视觉-语言模态重新对齐时观察到的显著能量变化，提出ΔEnergy OOD分数，并通过下界最大化(EBM)同时提升OOD检测和泛化能力。

Result: 在具有挑战性的OOD检测和泛化基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有方法，AUROC指标提升10%到25%。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy提供了一个统一的微调框架，能够同时提升VLMs在OOD泛化和OOD检测方面的鲁棒性，理论分析表明该方法能产生域一致的Hessian矩阵，这是OOD泛化的强指标。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sketch2Symm方法，通过两阶段生成过程从草图重建几何一致的3D形状，结合语义桥接和对称约束来解决草图稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于草图的3D重建面临挑战，因为草图输入抽象稀疏，缺乏足够的语义和几何信息。

Method: 两阶段生成方法：通过草图到图像翻译进行语义桥接丰富表示，并引入对称约束作为几何先验。

Result: 在主流草图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Chamfer距离、Earth Mover距离和F-Score指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 验证了语义桥接和对称感知设计的有效性，能够从稀疏草图中生成几何一致的3D形状。

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

### [185] [Evaluating the effects of preprocessing, method selection, and hyperparameter tuning on SAR-based flood mapping and water depth estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11305)
*Jean-Paul Travert,Cédric Goeury,Sébastien Boyaval,Vito Bacchi,Fabrice Zaoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了SAR图像预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法对洪水模拟的影响，发现在整个处理流程中方法选择和参数调优都会带来显著不确定性，建议采用集成方法而非单一配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水制图和水深估计对水文模型校准验证至关重要，但SAR图像处理中不同方法和参数选择的影响尚未系统研究，需要评估整个处理流程的不确定性。

Method: 使用SAR图像，评估了多种预处理（特别是斑点噪声抑制）、洪水制图和深度估计方法，通过考虑预处理图像、洪水图和水深场的集成来研究方法和超参数的影响，使用水动力模拟和现场观测作为参考数据。

Result: 斑点滤波器的选择会改变洪水范围估计达数平方公里；监督方法优于无监督方法，但调优后的无监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可达到相当效果；预处理和洪水制图步骤的累积不确定性导致水深估计的高变异性。

Conclusion: 必须考虑包含预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法及其超参数的整个处理流程，应采用集成方法并考虑方法不确定性，洪水制图中方法选择影响最大，水深估计中洪水图输入和方法超参数影响最大。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

TL;DR: 提出了InternSVG系列，这是一个集成数据-基准-模型的套件，包括最大的SVG多模态数据集SAgoge、配套基准SArena和统一的MLLM模型InternSVG，用于SVG的理解、编辑和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SVG建模面临的挑战：数据集碎片化、方法跨任务迁移性差、处理结构复杂性困难。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型的强大迁移和泛化能力，采用SVG特定特殊标记、基于子词的嵌入初始化和两阶段训练策略（从短静态SVG到长序列插图和复杂动画）。

Result: 在SArena和先前基准测试中，InternSVG实现了显著提升，持续优于领先的开源和专有对应模型。

Conclusion: 统一建模方法能够诱导正向迁移并提高整体性能，为SVG理解、编辑和生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

TL;DR: 提出MMAP框架，通过多放大倍率特征提取和原型增强机制，从H&E染色组织图像预测空间转录组基因表达，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从组织学图像预测空间基因表达时存在两个关键局限：局部特征提取粒度不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不充分。

Method: MMAP框架采用多放大倍率补丁表示捕获细粒度组织学细节，并学习潜在原型嵌入作为切片级信息的紧凑表示。

Result: 在多个评估指标（MAE、MSE、PCC）上，MMAP始终优于所有现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMAP通过同时解决局部特征粒度和全局上下文覆盖问题，显著提升了从组织学图像预测空间基因表达的性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

TL;DR: 提出一种在ControlNet中引入不确定性控制的方法，利用未标记域的数据来生成带有标注的合成数据，从而改善跨域分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet倾向于复制原始训练分布，限制了数据增强效果。需要利用未标记域数据来生成目标域的高质量标注数据，以解决领域偏移问题。

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合来自未标记数据集的不确定性控制和来自标记数据集的语义控制，生成目标域的高不确定性标注数据。

Result: 在视网膜OCT和交通场景实验中，该方法显著改善了跨域分割结果，无需额外监督即可适应大域偏移。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导方法优于风格迁移，能够实现任意域偏移而无需严格学习图像风格，为跨域分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Motivation: 基于强化学习的推理型图像质量评估模型虽然泛化能力强，但其推理能耗和延迟远高于传统模型，限制了实际部署。同时，这些模型泛化能力的内在机制尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出RALI算法，使用对比学习直接将图像与通过强化学习学到的可泛化文本表示对齐，无需依赖推理过程或加载大型语言模型。

Result: RALI在质量评分任务中达到了与推理型模型相当的泛化性能，同时只需要不到5%的模型参数和推理时间。

Conclusion: 通过直接对齐图像与可泛化文本表示，可以显著降低推理型图像质量评估模型的计算成本，同时保持其优异的泛化能力，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多视角一致性的高斯泼溅反射建模方法，通过多视角一致的材料推断和基于物理的环境建模来准确学习反射效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在材料推断时缺乏足够约束，特别是在有限环境建模下，会导致光照混叠和泛化能力下降。

Method: 强制2D高斯在多视角下产生一致的材料图，通过跟踪视角间的光度变化识别高反射区域作为反射强度先验，并引入基于2DGS光线追踪的环境建模策略处理间接光照。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法能够忠实恢复光照和几何，在新视角合成中达到最先进的渲染质量。

Conclusion: 多视角一致的材料推断和基于物理的环境建模是高斯泼溅中学习准确反射的关键。

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理工作流自动化主要关注文本质量，忽视了视觉结构和样式对文档可读性和参与度的重要性，缺乏合适的奖励模型来引导生成具有良好结构和样式的文档。

Method: 构建了包含117K对文档的多领域数据集DocPair，涵盖32个领域和267种文档类型，每对包含内容和相同但结构和样式不同的高专业度和低专业度文档。使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型来评分文档。

Result: DocReward在准确性上分别比GPT-4o和GPT-5高出30.6和19.4个百分点。在文档生成的外部评估中，DocReward的胜率达到60.8%，显著高于GPT-5的37.7%。

Conclusion: DocReward在评估文档结构和样式质量方面表现出色，能够有效引导生成代理产生人类偏好的文档，填补了现有代理工作流在视觉结构和样式评估方面的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在表面重建和新视角合成方面均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的视图对齐方法有效增强了3D高斯的几何表示能力，显著提高了表面重建的准确性和多视图一致性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o,
Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with
enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they
significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and
computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces
AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on
Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model
architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves
first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including
fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image
comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual

*Francesco Milano,Jen Jen Chung,Lionel Ott,Roland Siegwart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的表面法线积分方法，通过将问题重新定义为估计连续组件的相对尺度，大幅减少优化变量数量，实现了快速且高质量的表面重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的法线积分方法需要迭代全局优化来估计每个像素的深度，在处理大分辨率法线图时计算效率低下，无法扩展到更大的法线图。

Method: 将法线积分重新定义为估计连续组件的相对尺度，约束同一组件的像素共同调整尺度；包括准确估计连续组件的启发式方法、重新平衡优化项的策略以及迭代合并组件以进一步减小问题规模的技术。

Result: 在标准法线积分基准测试中达到最先进结果，仅需几秒钟完成；在大分辨率法线图上比像素级方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法通过组件级优化显著提高了法线积分的计算效率，同时保持了重建质量，为大规模表面重建提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

TL;DR: Situat3DChange是一个大规模3D数据集，支持三种情境感知的变化理解任务，包含121K问答对、36K变化描述和17K重排指令，通过11K人类观察构建，并提出SCReasoner方法进行高效点云比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D数据集和评估基准主要关注动态场景或动态情况的孤立方面，导致理解不完整，需要克服这些限制来全面理解动态环境。

Method: 利用11K人类观察建立共享心理模型和情境意识，结合自我中心和他人中心视角以及空间关系，使用LLM整合支持情境变化理解；提出SCReasoner方法进行高效点云比较，参数开销小且无需额外语言解码器token。

Result: 在Situat3DChange任务上的综合评估显示了MLLMs在动态场景和情境理解方面的进展和局限性；数据扩展和跨域迁移实验证明了该数据集作为MLLMs训练数据的任务无关有效性。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange数据集和SCReasoner方法为动态环境理解提供了重要工具，展示了在情境感知变化理解方面的潜力，同时也揭示了当前MLLMs的局限性。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

TL;DR: LikePhys是一个无需训练的方法，通过去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代来评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解，区分物理有效和不可能的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解对于构建通用物理合理世界模拟器至关重要，但由于难以在生成中分离物理正确性和视觉外观，准确评估这种能力仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代，在精心策划的有效-无效视频对数据集上区分物理有效和不可能的视频。

Result: 在涵盖四个物理领域的十二个场景构建的基准测试中，我们的评估指标PPE与人类偏好表现出强对齐，优于最先进的评估器基线。

Conclusion: 尽管当前模型在处理复杂和混沌动力学方面存在困难，但随着模型容量和推理设置的扩展，物理理解能力显示出明确的改进趋势。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

TL;DR: mmWalk是一个用于盲人和低视力人群户外安全导航的多模态模拟数据集，包含12万手动控制的行走轨迹和62k同步帧，涵盖RGB、深度和语义模态的55.9万张全景图像，并配有6.9万视觉问答对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲人和低视力人群在极端或复杂环境中行走辅助的挑战，由于缺乏整体场景理解能力，需要开发更全面的导航辅助系统。

Method: 构建mmWalk多模态数据集，包含多视角传感器和面向无障碍的特征，生成mmWalkVQA视觉问答基准，并在零样本和少样本设置下评估最先进的视觉语言模型。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在风险评估和导航任务上表现不佳，但经过mmWalk微调的模型在真实世界数据集上验证有效。

Conclusion: mmWalk数据集能够有效推进多模态行走辅助技术的发展，为盲人和低视力人群提供更安全的导航解决方案。

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了DiTs中的大规模激活现象，发现这些激活在局部细节合成中起关键作用，并提出了一种无需训练的自引导策略DG来增强细节保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs内部特征图中存在大规模激活现象，但其功能尚未被充分理解，需要系统研究这些激活在视觉生成中的作用。

Method: 提出Detail Guidance (DG)策略，通过破坏大规模激活构建退化的"细节缺失"模型，并用其引导原始网络实现更高质量的细节合成。DG可与Classifier-Free Guidance无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明DG能持续改进各种预训练DiTs（如SD3、SD3.5、Flux）的细粒度细节质量。

Conclusion: 大规模激活在局部细节合成中发挥关键作用，提出的DG策略能有效提升DiTs的细节保真度，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在传统2D图像理解上表现优异，但在理解全向图像提供的沉浸式环境方面能力仍未被充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含2000张全向图像和4000个问答对的ODI-Bench基准，并提出基于思维链推理的Omni-CoT训练方法。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLMs在全向图像理解上仍有困难，而Omni-CoT方法能显著提升模型在沉浸式环境中的理解能力。

Conclusion: 全向图像理解是一个重要但尚未充分探索的研究方向，提出的基准和方法为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Motivation: 胸部X光分类任务资源密集，通常需要大量标注数据。基础模型减少了这种依赖，但所需标注样本数量仍不明确。

Method: 系统评估使用幂律拟合来预测达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需的训练样本数量，测试多种病理和基础模型。

Result: XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP在显著减少标注样本的情况下实现强性能，仅需50个标注病例的学习曲线斜率即可准确预测最终性能平台。

Conclusion: 研究结果使实践者能够通过仅标注达到目标性能所需的基本样本来最小化标注成本。

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

Motivation: 解决当前交互式3D分割方法局限于单一域和单一交互形式的问题，避免多数据集训练时的负迁移，开发一个通用且可扩展的3D标注工具。

Method: 使用7个跨域数据集训练，采用域自适应归一化防止负迁移；对于文本提示分割，自动生成掩码提案并与CLIP文本查询嵌入匹配，支持全景和开放词汇分割。

Result: 在9个零样本空间提示分割基准中的8个达到最先进性能，在5个文本提示基准中表现竞争力，统一模型性能可匹敌或超越专用域特定方法。

Conclusion: SNAP证明了统一模型能够有效处理跨域3D分割任务，为可扩展的3D标注提供了实用工具，展示了通用方法的可行性。

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感感知的混合机制有效解决了多模态情感分析中的数据增强问题，显著提升了模型性能，为多模态情感分析提供了更鲁棒的增强方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归方法在训练视图和查询图像的成像条件差异较大时容易失败，因为其训练目标是在坐标回归器权重中编码训练视图，本质上会过拟合训练数据。

Method: 将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，在数万个场景上预训练变换器，使其能够从映射图像泛化到未见过的查询图像。

Result: 在多个挑战性重定位数据集上，ACE-G方法显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了有吸引力的计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，并利用大规模预训练，ACE-G方法成功解决了传统场景坐标回归方法的泛化限制问题。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽视了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长期特性，特别是湿实验室环境，需要系统评估MLLMs在科学实验视频中的实际能力。

Method: 从同行评审视频出版物中构建ExpVid基准，采用三级任务层次：细粒度感知、程序理解、科学推理，结合自动化生成和多学科专家验证的视觉中心标注流程。

Result: 评估19个领先MLLMs发现，它们在粗粒度识别上表现良好，但在区分细节、跟踪状态变化和连接实验程序与科学结果方面存在困难，专有模型与开源模型在高级推理上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够成为科学实验可信赖伙伴的MLLMs制定了路线图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and

TL;DR: LLF-LUT++是一种金字塔网络，通过拉普拉斯金字塔分解和重建整合全局和局部算子，实现高分辨率图像的快速处理和优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有照片增强方法要么性能强大但无法在边缘设备部署，要么计算高效但性能不足，需要兼顾性能与效率的解决方案。

Method: 使用图像自适应3D LUT处理全局色调特征，结合空间频率变换器权重预测器提取权重，应用局部拉普拉斯滤波器优化高频细节。

Result: 在HDR+数据集上PSNR提升2.64 dB，4K分辨率图像处理仅需13毫秒，在两个基准数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++在保持高性能的同时显著降低运行时间，为实际应用提供了有效的照片增强解决方案。

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NV3D模型，通过从体素邻居获取局部特征，使用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量，结合两种采样策略可减少55%数据量，在KITTI数据集上取得优于基线的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态方法面临特征对齐挑战，而局部特征获取方法对于复杂3D物体检测任务可能过于简化，需要更有效的特征表示方法。

Method: 使用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量作为局部特征，提出法向量密度采样和FOV感知分箱采样两种策略，并采用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI验证集上，无采样时汽车和骑行者检测mAP分别达到86.60%和80.18%，比基线Voxel R-CNN提升2.61%和4.23%；使用采样后汽车检测mAP为85.54%，比基线提升1.56%，同时过滤掉约55%体素。

Conclusion: 法向量特征能有效捕捉表面与目标实体关系，采样策略在保持性能的同时显著减少计算量，特别适用于汽车和骑行者等具有特定空间形状的目标检测。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在处理深度模糊、遮挡和物理不一致接触时存在困难，需要一种能够从单张图像重建度量准确且物理合理的人-场景交互的方法。

Method: 从粗略的单目深度和人体估计开始，进行遮挡感知修复，融合可见深度与未缩放几何构建度量支架，合成缺失支撑表面，通过置信度加权优化联合约束深度对齐、接触先验、穿透避免和2D重投影一致性。

Conclusion: PhySIC能够将单张图像转换为物理合理的3D人-场景对，推进了可扩展的3D场景理解，支持多人交互重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Motivation: 现有自动概念发现方法往往无法将提取的概念与模型真实决策过程对齐，损害了解释的忠实性。

Method: 在非负矩阵分解(NMF)基础上添加KL散度正则化项，在概念学习中融入分类器监督，强制预测一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO和CelebA数据集上的系统评估显示，FACE在忠实性和稀疏性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACE框架通过理论保证和实验验证，能够提供更忠实的概念解释，弥合了低层特征与高层语义之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Conclusion: 为机器人和具身AI中的开放集6D理解建立了新标准，证明了仅使用合成数据训练的模型在真实世界中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

TL;DR: 该论文提出用表示自编码器(RAE)替代传统VAE作为扩散变换器(DiT)的潜在空间编码器，解决了VAE在架构、信息容量和表示质量方面的限制，并在ImageNet上取得了优异的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DiT使用的VAE编码器存在三个主要问题：过时的骨干网络损害架构简洁性、低维潜在空间限制信息容量、以及纯重建训练导致的弱表示质量限制了生成质量。

Method: 使用预训练的表示编码器(如DINO、SigLIP、MAE)配合训练的解码器构建表示自编码器(RAE)，分析高维潜在空间中扩散变换器的运行挑战，提出理论解决方案，并使用配备轻量级宽DDT头的DiT变体。

Result: 在ImageNet上取得了优异的图像生成结果：256x256分辨率下无引导FID为1.51，有引导时256x256和512x512分辨率下FID均为1.13，实现了更快的收敛且无需辅助表示对齐损失。

Conclusion: RAE具有明显优势，应该成为扩散变换器训练的新标准方法。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Conclusion: 这种混合方法在图像分类中具有更高的效率和鲁棒性潜力。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，显著提升了全景图像生成的质量和几何保真度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪器和视频生成器解决密切相关的问题：前者分析运动，后者合成运动。这种联系使得预训练视频扩散模型能够通过视觉标记点来进行零样本点跟踪。

Method: 在查询点放置独特颜色的标记，然后从中等噪声水平重新生成视频的其余部分，从而传播标记并追踪点的轨迹。使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示，确保标记在反事实生成中保持可见。

Result: 实验表明，这种"涌现"的跟踪方法优于先前的零样本方法，能够持续通过遮挡，性能与专门的自监督模型相当。

Conclusion: 预训练视频扩散模型可以通过简单的提示实现有效的零样本点跟踪，展示了生成模型在运动分析任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS证明了仅从事件流渲染非刚性变形物体新视角的可行性，为事件相机在动态场景重建中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at

TL;DR: CaDRO是一个因果引导的降维框架，通过因果发现识别对电路性能有重要影响的参数，固定低影响参数来加速多目标优化，相比NSGA-II收敛速度提升10倍且Pareto质量更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化算法如NSGA-II在模拟电路多目标优化中面临高维参数空间、强反馈耦合和昂贵仿真等挑战，对所有参数同等处理导致效率低下。

Method: CaDRO通过混合观测-干预过程构建定量因果图，按参数对目标的因果效应排序，固定低影响参数，仅对关键参数进行进化搜索。

Result: 在放大器、稳压器和射频电路中，CaDRO比NSGA-II收敛快10倍，Pareto质量保持或改善，如折叠共源共栅放大器超体积从0.56提升到0.94。

Conclusion: 因果引导的降维能显著提升模拟电路多目标优化的效率和效果，为高维设计空间优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization of analog circuits is hindered by
high-dimensional parameter spaces, strong feedback couplings, and expensive
transistor-level simulations. Evolutionary algorithms such as Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are widely used but treat all parameters
equally, thereby wasting effort on variables with little impact on performance,
which limits their scalability. We introduce CaDRO, a causal-guided
dimensionality reduction framework that embeds causal discovery into the
optimization pipeline. CaDRO builds a quantitative causal map through a hybrid
observational-interventional process, ranking parameters by their causal effect
on the objectives. Low-impact parameters are fixed to values from high-quality
solutions, while critical drivers remain active in the search. The reduced
design space enables focused evolutionary optimization without modifying the
underlying algorithm. Across amplifiers, regulators, and RF circuits, CaDRO
converges up to 10$\times$ faster than NSGA-II while preserving or improving
Pareto quality. For instance, on the Folded-Cascode Amplifier, hypervolume
improves from 0.56 to 0.94, and on the LDO regulator from 0.65 to 0.81, with
large gains in non-dominated solutions.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效处理动力下降制导问题中的复合状态触发约束，保证了连续时间约束满足和算法收敛性。

Abstract: This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) framework for
ensuring the continuous-time satisfaction of compound state-triggered
constraints, a subset of logical specifications, in the powered descent
guidance (PDG) problem. The proposed framework combines the generalized
mean-based smooth robustness measure (D-GMSR), a parameterization technique
tailored for expressing discrete-time temporal and logical specifications
through smooth functions, with the continuous-time successive convexification
(CT-SCvx) method, a real-time solution for constrained trajectory optimization
that guarantees continuous-time constraint satisfaction and convergence. The
smoothness of the temporal and logical specifications parameterized via D-GMSR
enables solving the resulting optimization problem with robust and efficient
SCP algorithms while preserving theoretical guarantees. In addition to their
smoothness, the parameterized specifications are sound and complete, meaning
the specification holds if and only if the constraint defined by the
parameterized function is satisfied. The CT-SCvx framework is then applied to
solve the parameterized problem, incorporating: (1) reformulation for
continuous-time path constraint satisfaction, (2) time-dilation to transform
the free-final-time PDG problem into a fixed-final-time problem, (3) multiple
shooting for exact discretization, (4) exact penalty functions for penalizing
nonconvex constraints, and (5) the prox-linear method, a convergence-guaranteed
SCP algorithm, to solve the resulting finite-dimensional nonconvex PDG problem.
The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a numerical
simulation. The implementation is available at
https://github.com/UW-ACL/CT-cSTC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对非线性仿射控制系统在任意状态和输入约束下的安全性问题，需要一种通用且系统的方法来构建控制屏障函数，确保系统始终满足约束条件。

Method: 定义基于系统平衡流形的备份策略族，在增强的状态-参考空间中构建控制屏障函数，通过灵敏度分析计算非光滑雅可比矩阵来量化未来约束违反距离。

Result: 该方法成功应用于倒立摆系统，展示了其简单而通用的特性，能够有效处理非线性系统的约束安全控制问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为非线性控制系统提供了一种系统化的控制屏障函数构建框架，具有良好的通用性和实用性，特别适用于具有状态和输入约束的复杂系统。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach to construct control barrier
functions for nonlinear control affine systems subject to arbitrary state and
input constraints. Taking inspiration from the reference governor literature,
the proposed method defines a family of backup policies, parametrized by the
equilibrium manifold of the system. The control barrier function is defined on
the augmented state-and-reference space: given a state-reference pair, the
approach quantifies the distance to constraint violation at any time in the
future, should the current backup policy reference remain constant. Sensitivity
analysis is then used to compute the (possibly nonsmooth) Jacobian with respect
to the augmented state vector. To showcase its simple yet general nature, the
proposed method is applied to an inverted pendulum on cart.

TL;DR: 提出LFI-NODE方法，通过潜特征神经常微分方程模型，仅需少量轨迹数据即可实现黑箱并网逆变器的轻量级稳定性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑箱并网逆变器稳定性评估中数据需求大、受限于专有内部结构的问题。

Method: 使用单个连续时间神经网络参数化系统ODE，从轨迹数据中提取潜扰动特征指导学习过程，同时揭示小信号特征结构。

Result: 相比传统方法减少1-2个数量级的训练样本需求，仅需48个短暂态即可达到百分位轨迹预测误差和十分位特征值估计误差。

Conclusion: LFI-NODE为复杂黑箱电力电子系统提供了一种实用且轻量级的高保真稳定性评估方法。

Abstract: Stability evaluation of black-box grid-tied inverters is vital for grid
reliability, yet identification techniques are both data-hungry and blocked by
proprietary internals. {To solve this, this letter proposes a
latent-feature-informed neural ordinary differential equation (LFI-NODE)
modeling method that can achieve lightweight stability evaluation directly from
trajectory data.} LFI-NODE parameterizes the entire system ODE with a single
continuous-time neural network, allowing each new sample to refine a unified
global model. It faithfully captures nonlinear large-signal dynamics to
preserve uniform predictive accuracy as the inverter transitions between
operating points. Meanwhile, latent perturbation features distilled from every
trajectory steer the learning process and concurrently reveal the small-signal
eigenstructure essential for rigorous stability analysis. Validated on a
grid-forming inverter, {The LFI-NODE requires one to two orders of magnitude
fewer training samples compared with traditional methods, collected from short
time-domain trajectories instead of extensive frequency-domain measurements.}
{Furthermore, the LFI-NODE requires only 48 short transients to achieve a
trajectory prediction error at the hundredth level and an eigenvalue estimation
error at the tenth level, outperforming benchmark methods by one to two orders
of magnitude.} This makes LFI-NODE a practical and lightweight approach for
achieving high-fidelity stability assessment of complex black-box
power-electronic systems.

Motivation: 电力系统正经历根本性变革，逆变器发电挑战频率稳定性，数字化增加系统脆弱性。研究发现电网频率中普遍存在的一分钟振荡模式来源不明，需要探究其成因和影响。

Method: 通过分析全球电网频率时间序列，追踪振荡模式来源，识别出电池储能系统的能量管理系统是主要成因，并评估振幅增长趋势。

Result: 在Nordic和英国电网中，该一分钟振荡模式的振幅显著增加，证实了电池控制系统对电网频率的影响。

Conclusion: 这种效应可能对未来低惯量、高电池渗透率的电网稳定性构成负担，但可以通过修订电池控制算法来缓解。

Abstract: Electric power systems are undergoing fundamental change. The shift to
inverter-based generation challenges frequency stability, while growing
digitalisation heightens vulnerability to errors and attacks. Here we identify
an emerging risk at the intersection of cyber-physical coupling and control
system design. We show that grid frequency time series worldwide exhibit a
persistent one-minute oscillatory pattern, whose origin has remained largely
unexplained. We trace this pattern back to the energy management systems of
battery electric storage systems and demonstrate that the pattern amplitude has
increased substantially in the Nordic and British grids. We argue that this
effect is a potential burden for stability in future grids with low inertia and
an increasing penetration with batteries and smart devices, though it can be
mitigated by a revision of battery control algorithms.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have seen widespread success in providing
forward invariance and safety guarantees for dynamical control systems. A
crucial limitation of discrete-time formulations is that CBFs that are
nonconcave in their argument require the solution of nonconvex optimization
problems to compute safety-preserving control inputs, which inhibits real-time
computation of control inputs guaranteeing forward invariance. This paper
presents a novel method for computing safety-preserving control inputs for
discrete-time systems with nonconvex safety sets, utilizing convex optimization
and the recently developed class of matrix control barrier function techniques.
The efficacy of our methods is demonstrated through numerical simulations on a
bicopter system.

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入粘性控制屏障函数(viscosity CBFs)来桥接控制屏障函数(CBFs)和哈密顿-雅可比可达性(HJR)两个安全控制框架，建立了它们之间的深层联系。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，CBFs和HJR被视为两个不同的安全控制框架，前者专注于最优安全控制器设计，后者提供安全性的充分条件。论文旨在建立这两个框架之间的理论桥梁。

Method: 将CBFs推广到不可微的粘性CBFs，并证明粘性CBFs与控制屏障值函数(CB-VFs)之间的深层联系。扩展CB-VFs到非指数反折扣，并更新相应理论。

Result: 证明了粘性CBFs正是那些提供CBF类安全保证(控制不变性和边界平滑逼近)的函数，并展示了粘性CBFs在最大值和极限操作下的良好闭包性质。

Conclusion: 成功桥接了CBF和HJR框架，通过粘性CBFs建立了两个框架之间的理论联系，为安全控制提供了更统一的理论基础。

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) and Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) are
central frameworks in safe control. Traditionally, these frameworks have been
viewed as distinct, with the former focusing on optimally safe controller
design and the latter providing sufficient conditions for safety. A previous
work introduced the notion of a control barrier value function (CB-VF), which
is defined similarly to the other value functions studied in HJR but has
certain CBF-like properties. In this work, we proceed the other direction by
generalizing CBFs to non-differentiable ``viscosity'' CBFs. We show the deep
connection between viscosity CBFs and CB-VFs, bridging the CBF and HJR
frameworks. Through this bridge, we characterize the viscosity CBFs as
precisely those functions which provide CBF-like safety guarantees (control
invariance and smooth approach to the boundary). We then further show nice
theoretical properties of viscosity CBFs, including their desirable closure
under maximum and limit operations. In the process, we also extend CB-VFs to
non-exponential anti-discounting and update the corresponding theory for CB-VFs
along these lines.

Abstract: We investigate the potential impact of communication and human performance
uncertainties on runway operations. Specifically, we consider these impacts
within the context of an arrival scenario with two converging flows: a
straight-in approach stream and a downwind stream merging into it. Both arrival
stream are modeled using a modified Possion distribution that incorporate the
separation minima as well as the runway occupancy time. Various system level
uncertainties are addressed in this process, including communication link- and
human-related uncertainties. In this research, we first build a Monte
Carlo-based discrete-time simulation, where aircraft arrivals are generated by
modified Poisson processes subject to minimum separation constraints,
simulating various traffic operations. The merging logic incorporates standard
bank angle continuous turn-to-final, pilot response delays, and dynamic gap
availability in real time. Then, we investigate an automated final approach
vectoring model (i.e., Auto-ATC), in which inverse optimal control is used to
learn decision advisories from human expert records. By augmenting trajectories
and incorporating the aforementioned uncertainties into the planning scenario,
we create a setup analogous to the discrete event simulation. For both studies,
runway capacity is measured by runway throughput, the fraction of downwind
arrivals that merge immediately without holding, and the average delay (i.e.,
holding time/distance) experienced on the downwind leg. This research provides
a method for runway capacity estimation in merging scenarios, and demonstrates
that aeronautical communication link uncertainties significantly affect runway
capacity in current voice-based operations, whereas the impact can be mitigated
in autonomous operational settings.

Conclusion: 该分析视角使方法能够推广到多样化设计目标，为性能指标设计提供了统一框架，并提出系统化方法指导性能指标设计以塑造最优控制律。

Abstract: The design of the performance index, also referred to as cost or reward
shaping, is central to both optimal control and reinforcement learning, as it
directly determines the behaviors, trade-offs, and objectives that the
resulting control laws seek to achieve. A commonly used approach for this
inference task in recent years is differentiable trajectory optimization, which
allows gradients to be computed with respect to cost parameters by
differentiating through an optimal control solver. However, this method often
requires repeated solving of the underlying optimal control problem at every
iteration, making the method computationally expensive. In this work, assuming
known dynamics, we propose a novel framework that analytically links the
performance index to the resulting closed-loop optimal control law, thereby
transforming a typically bi-level inverse problem into a tractable single-level
formulation. Our approach is motivated by the question: given a closed-loop
control law that solves an infinite-horizon optimal control problem, how does
this law change when the performance index is modified with additional terms?
This formulation yields closed-form characterizations for broad classes of
systems and performance indices, which not only facilitate interpretation and
stability analysis, but also provide insight into the robust stability and
input-to-state stable behavior of the resulting nonlinear closed-loop system.
Moreover, this analytical perspective enables the generalization of our
approach to diverse design objectives, yielding a unifying framework for
performance index shaping. Given specific design objectives, we propose a
systematic methodology to guide the shaping of the performance index and
thereby design the resulting optimal control law.

Abstract: Local bifurcation analysis plays a central role in understanding qualitative
transitions in networked nonlinear dynamical systems, including dynamic neural
network and opinion dynamics models. In this article we establish explicit
bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two
classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure
to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach
leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of
Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear
systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods
around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain
reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an
illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which
emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new
analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in
dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network
structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.

Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with asymmetric electric field
pulses, such as monophasic, offers directional selectivity for neural
activation but requires excessive energy. Previous pulse shape optimisation has
been limited to symmetric pulses or heavily constrained variations of
conventional waveforms without achieving general optimality in energy
efficiency or neural selectivity. We implemented an optimisation framework that
incorporates neuron model activation constraints and flexible control of pulse
asymmetry. The optimised electric field waveforms achieved up to 92 % and 88 %
reduction in energy loss and thus coil heating respectively compared to
conventional monophasic pulses and previously improved monophasic-equivalent
pulses. In the human experiments, OUR pulses showed similar motor thresholds to
monophasic pulses in both AP and PA directions with significantly lower energy
loss, particularly in the AP direction. Moreover, there was a significant MEP
latency difference of (1.79 +/- 0.41) ms between AP and PA direction with OUR
pulses, which suggests directional selectivity. Our framework successfully
identified highly energy-efficient asymmetric pulses for
directionally-selective neural engagement. These pulses can enable selective
rapid-rate repetitive TMS protocols with reduced power consumption and coil
heating, with potential benefits for precision and potency of neuro-modulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose symbolic decision trees as surrogate models for
approximating model predictive control laws. The proposed approach learns
simultaneously the partition of the input domain (splitting logic) as well as
local nonlinear expressions for predicting the control action leading to
interpretable piecewise nonlinear control laws. The local nonlinear expressions
are determined by the learning problem and are modeled using a set of basis
functions. The learning task is posed as a mixed integer optimization, which is
solved to global optimality with state-of-the-art global optimization solvers.
We apply the proposed approach to a case study regarding the control of an
isothermal reactor. The results show that the proposed approach can learn the
control law accurately, leading to closed-loop performance comparable to that
of a standard model predictive controller. Finally, comparison with existing
interpretable models shows that the symbolic trees achieve both lower
prediction error and superior closed-loop performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-budgeted monitor with a control framework that
certifies safety for autonomous driving. In this process, a sliding window is
proposed to monitor for insufficient barrier residuals or nonzero tail risk,
ensuring system safety. When the safety margin deteriorates, it triggers
switching the safety constraint from a performance-based relaxed-control
barrier function (R-CBF) to a conservative conditional value at risk (CVaR-CBF)
to address the safety concern. This switching is governed by two real-time
triggers: Feasibility-Triggered (FT) and Quality-Triggered (QT) conditions. In
the FT condition, if the R-CBF constraint becomes infeasible or yields a
suboptimal solution, the risk monitor triggers the use of the CVaR constraints
for the controller. In the QT condition, the risk monitor observes the safety
margin of the R-CBF solution at every step, regardless of feasibility. If it
falls below the safety margin, the safety filter switches to the CVaR-CBF
constraints.
  The proposed framework is evaluated using a model predictive controller (MPC)
for autonomous driving in the presence of autonomous vehicle (AV) localization
noise and obstacle position uncertainties. Multiple AV-pedestrian interaction
scenarios are considered, with 1,500 Monte Carlo runs conducted for all
scenarios. In the most challenging setting with pedestrian detection
uncertainty of 5 m, the proposed framework achieves a 94-96% success rate of
not colliding with the pedestrians over 300 trials while maintaining the lowest
mean cross-track error (CTE = 3.2-3.6 m) to the reference path. The reduced CTE
indicates faster trajectory recovery after obstacle avoidance, demonstrating a
balance between safety and performance.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效处理部分未知系统的增量稳定性和安全性问题

Abstract: Incremental stability is a property of dynamical systems that ensures the
convergence of trajectories with respect to each other rather than a fixed
equilibrium point or a fixed trajectory. In this paper, we introduce a related
stability notion called incremental input-to-state practical stability
({\delta}-ISpS), ensuring safety guarantees. We also present a feedback
linearization based control design scheme that renders a partially unknown
system incrementally input-to-state practically stable and safe with formal
guarantees. To deal with the unknown dynamics, we utilize Gaussian process
regression to approximate the model. Finally, we implement the controller
synthesized by the proposed scheme on a manipulator example

TL;DR: 将Tarlac州立大学体育馆改造为近零能耗建筑，通过集成太阳能光伏系统实现能源效率，但需要考虑额外的电气系统升级成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于近零能耗建筑原则，旨在减少碳足迹，将传统体育馆改造为能源高效设施。

Method: 集成太阳能光伏系统作为可再生能源，同时升级电气基础设施，包括更换LED高棚灯、增加空调设备和电源插座。

Result: 分析显示投资回收期在平均范围内，具有成本效益，但需要额外投资升级电气系统。

Conclusion: 项目具有可行性，但需要全面计算总成本，包括电气系统升级费用，并考虑屋顶结构完整性等工程因素。

Abstract: The study is anchored to the principles of Nearly-Zero Energy Building
(NZEB). It aimed to transform the Tarlac State University Gymnasium into a
facility with energy-efficient equipment to contribute to reducing carbon
footprints by integrating a solar PV system as its renewable energy source. The
researchers found out that the electrical infrastructure of the Gym was
outdated, and the lighting was not energy efficient, and there were too few
convenience or power outlets. There was also insufficient cooling equipment to
maintain a comfortable temperature. Analysis shows that the payback period is
within the average range, making it a cost-effective investment for the
University. Aside from the cost of the PV System, adherence to engineering
design standards will mean additional costs to replace the metal halides with
LED high bay lamps, installation of additional air conditioning units, and
provision of additional convenience outlets. These additional costs should be
considered when evaluating the feasibility of the project. It is recommended
that the integrity of the existing roof system of the Gymnasium be considered.
The total cost of putting up the whole electrical system, including new
lighting, cooling, and convenience loads, must be calculated to determine the
total cost of implementing the whole NZEB project. Other factors in the
economic evaluation may be considered to determine a more stringent result.

Abstract: Coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) can engender flexibility
necessary to improve grid reliability. Packetized Energy Management (PEM) is a
method for coordinating DERs, such as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs)
and electric vehicles, within customer quality-of-service (QoS) limits. In PEM,
a DER uses local information to offer flexibility by sending a request to the
DER coordinator to turn-ON or turn-OFF. Much work has focused on modeling and
analyzing aggregations of DERs under PEM with fixed packet durations and only
turn-ON requests. Different recent efforts to enable variable packet lengths
have shown an increase in available flexibility and ramping capability, but
have not been modeled in aggregate, which limits systematic analyses. To
address this issue, this paper presents a new aggregate bin-based (macro) model
of PEM loads that incorporates both turn-ON and turn-OFF request features,
enabling the model to accurately characterize the capability of the fleet of
DERs to track a power reference signal, population temperature dynamics,
aggregate request rates, and variable packet lengths. Simulation-based
validation is performed against an agent-based (micro) model to evaluate
robustness and quantify model accuracy. Finally, the distribution of variable
packet lengths from macro-model simulations are applied to inform past work on
PEM with randomized packet lengths

Abstract: Physically interpretable models are essential for next-generation industrial
systems, as these representations enable effective control, support design
validation, and provide a foundation for monitoring strategies. The aim of this
paper is to develop a system identification framework for estimating modal
models of complex multivariable mechanical systems from frequency response
data. To achieve this, a two-step structured identification algorithm is
presented, where an additive model is first estimated using a refined
instrumental variable method and subsequently projected onto a modal form. The
developed identification method provides accurate, physically-relevant,
minimal-order models, for both generally-damped and proportionally damped modal
systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through
experimental validation on a prototype wafer-stage system, which features a
large number of spatially distributed actuators and sensors and exhibits
complex flexible dynamics.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for estimating the parameters of an aggregated
distributed energy resources (der_a) model. First, we introduce a rigorous
method to determine whether all model parameters are estimable. When they are
not, our approach identifies the subset of parameters that can be estimated.
The proposed framework offers new insights into the number and specific
parameters that can be reliably estimated based on commonly available
measurements. It also highlights the limitations of calibrating such models.
Second, we introduce a Kalman filtering method to calibrate the der_a model.
Since we account for nonlinear effects such as saturation and deadbands, we
develop a specific mechanism to handle smoothing functions within the Kalman
filter. Specifically, we consider the extended and the unscented Kalman filter.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a modified IEEE
34-node distribution feeder with inverter-based resources. Our findings align
with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's parameterization
guideline and underscore the importance of model calibration in accurately
capturing the collective dynamics of distributed energy resources installed on
distribution systems.

Motivation: 交通电气化是全球向净零排放转型的关键挑战，交通部门通常占国家能源消耗的四分之一以上。实现这一转变不仅需要广泛采用电动汽车，还需要将其无缝集成到相互依赖的基础设施系统中，特别是交通-电力耦合系统。

Abstract: The electrification of transportation represents a critical challenge in the
global transition toward net-zero emissions, as the sector often accounts for
more than one-quarter of national energy consumption. Achieving this
transformation requires not only widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs)
but also their seamless integration into interdependent infrastructure
systems-specifically, the transportation-electricity nexus (TEN). This paper
develops an optimal multi-modal transportation and electric power flow (OMTEPF)
model to evaluate the benefits of coordinated, dynamic system operation.
Building on recent advances in hetero-functional graph theory, the framework
enables joint optimization of five key operational decisions in intelligent TEN
management: vehicle dispatch, route choice, charging station queuing,
coordinated charging, and vehicle-to-grid stabilization. The mesoscopic,
dynamic model explicitly represents individual EVs and their state-of-charge
trajectories, thereby extending beyond the prevailing literature's focus on
static, macroscopic traffic assignment. It further captures the full scope of
the TEN as a system-of-systems, incorporating five distinct charging
modalities: private residential, private commercial, wired public commercial,
inductive public, and discharging. On the power system side, an IV-ACOPF
formulation ensures globally optimal solutions to the electrical subproblems.
Comparative analysis demonstrates the substantial value of coordinated TEN
operation relative to the status quo of siloed, uncoordinated infrastructure
management. This work provides both a novel methodological contribution and
actionable insights for the co-design and operation of next-generation
sustainable mobility-energy systems.

Motivation: 模块化产品设计已成为企业平衡产品多样性、运营效率和市场响应能力的关键战略，但现有的MFD方法缺乏对装配考虑的系统支持，增加了生产爬坡延迟和生命周期效率低下的风险。

Method: 扩展的MFD方法引入了结构化启发式、面向装配的模块驱动因素、编码接口分类法以及评估装配可行性和自动化准备度的量化指标，同时保持与标准MFFD工作流程的兼容性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过装配视角支持早期阶段对架构替代方案的评估，能够更快地过渡到高效的批量生产，并为产品生命周期中的持续改进奠定基础。

Abstract: Modular product design has become a strategic enabler for companies seeking
to balance product variety, operational efficiency, and market responsiveness,
making the alignment between modular architecture and manufacturing
considerations increasingly critical. Modular Function Deployment (MFD) is a
widely adopted method for defining modular product architectures, yet it lacks
systematic support for assembly considerations during early concept and
system-level development. This limitation increases the risk of delayed
production ramp-up and lifecycle inefficiencies. This paper proposes a set of
enhancements to MFD that integrate Design for Assembly (DFA) logic into
architectural synthesis. The extended method introduces structured heuristics,
assembly-oriented module drivers, a coded interface taxonomy, and quantitative
metrics for assessing assembly feasibility and automation readiness. These
additions preserve compatibility with standard MFD workflows while enriching
decision-making with traceable, production-informed reasoning. An illustrative
case study involving a handheld leaf blower demonstrates the method's usability
and effectiveness. The redesigned architecture shows reduced assembly effort,
simplified interfaces, and increased automation potential. By supporting
early-stage evaluation of architectural alternatives through an assembly lens,
the method enables faster transition to efficient volume production and
provides a foundation for continuous improvement throughout the product
lifecycle.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效计算动态交通分布下的枢纽容量，为铁路基础设施效率优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The efficiency of railway infrastructure is significantly influenced by the
mix of trains that utilize it, as different service types have competing
operational requirements. While freight services might require extended service
times, passenger services demand more predictable schedules. Traditional
methods for addressing long-term traffic assignment problems often rely on
fixed-value capacity limitations, determined based on specific assumptions
about traffic composition. This paper introduces a methodology for determining
timetable-independent capacity within the traffic rate assignment problem,
enabling the calculation of junction capacities under dynamic traffic
distributions. We solve the underlying non-linear constrained optimization
problem maximizing the traffic throughput using Bayesian optimization (BO).
This setting combines a known objective function with expensive- to-compute
capacity constraints, motivating an adaption of standard BO problems, where
objective functions are usually unknown. We tailor the acquisition process in
BO to this specific setting and increase performance by incorporating prior
knowledge about the shape of the constraint functions into the Gaussian process
surrogate model. Our derived approaches are benchmarked on a railway junction
near Paris, significantly outperforming fixed traffic composition models and
highlighting the benefits of dynamic capacity allocation.

Motivation: 现代电网面临数据生成位置与处理位置不匹配的问题：保护继电器、电动汽车充电和分布式可再生能源需要在边缘进行毫秒级分析，而能耗密集型工作负载往往位于遥远的云端，导致错过实时截止期限和浪费电力。

Conclusion: 与之前仅边缘或仅云的方案不同，SDEN通过统一的软件定义方法解决了电网计算碎片化问题，实现了端到端的能源、延迟和可靠性优化。

Abstract: Modern power grids face an acute mismatch between where data is generated and
where it can be processed: protection relays, EV (Electric Vehicle) charging,
and distributed renewables demand millisecond analytics at the edge, while
energy-hungry workloads often sit in distant clouds leading to missed real-time
deadlines and wasted power. We address this by proposing, to our knowledge, the
first-ever SDEN (Software Defined Energy Network) for CaaS
(Computations-as-a-Service) that unifies edge, fog, and cloud compute with 5G
URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications), SDN (Software Defined
Networking), and NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) to co-optimize energy,
latency, and reliability end-to-end. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a
joint task offloading formulation that couples computation placement with
network capacity under explicit URLLC constraints; (ii) a feasibility
preserving, lightweight greedy heuristic that scales while closely tracking
optimal energy and latency trade-offs; and (iii) a tiered AI (Artificial
Intelligence) pipeline-reactive at the edge, predictive in the fog, strategic
in the cloud-featuring privacy-preserving, federated GNNs (Graph Neural
Networks) for fault detection and microgrid coordination. Unlike prior
edge-only or cloud-only schemes, SDEN turns fragmented grid compute into a
single, programmable substrate that delivers dependable, energy-aware, real
time analytics establishing a first-ever, software defined path to practical,
grid-scale CaaS.

Conclusion: pyspect的设计分离了实现开发者（开发可达性数值程序）和最终用户（编写规范）的关注点，简化了复杂任务的可达性程序开发过程。

Abstract: In this paper, we present pyspect, a Python toolbox that simplifies the use
of reachability analysis for temporal logic problems. Currently, satisfying
complex requirements in cyber-physical systems requires significant manual
effort and domain expertise to develop the underlying reachability programs.
This high development effort limits the broader adoption of reachability
analysis for complex verification problems. To address this, pyspect provides a
method-agnostic approach to performing reachability analysis for verifying a
temporal logic specification via temporal logic trees (TLTs). It enables the
specification of complex safety and liveness requirements using high-level
logic formulations that are independent of any particular reachability
technique or set representation. As a result, pyspect allows for the comparison
of different reachability implementations, such as Hamilton-Jacobi and Hybrid
Zonotope-based reachability analysis, for the same temporal logic
specification. This design separates the concerns of implementation developers
(who develop numerical procedures for reachability) and end-users (who write
specifications). Through a simple vehicle example, we demonstrate how pyspect
simplifies the synthesis of reachability programs, promotes specification
reusability, and facilitates side-by-side comparisons of reachability
techniques for complex tasks.

Conclusion: 基于推测解码的边缘LLM服务框架能有效降低服务延迟，通过大小模型协作和联合优化策略，为边缘环境下的LLM推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference at the network edge is a promising
serving paradigm that leverages distributed edge resources to run inference
near users and enhance privacy. Existing edge-based LLM inference systems
typically adopt autoregressive decoding (AD), which only generates one token
per forward pass. This iterative process, compounded by the limited
computational resources of edge nodes, results in high serving latency and
constrains the system's ability to support multiple users under growing
demands.To address these challenges, we propose a speculative decoding
(SD)-based LLM serving framework that deploys small and large models across
heterogeneous edge nodes to collaboratively deliver inference services.
Specifically, the small model rapidly generates draft tokens that the large
model verifies in parallel, enabling multi-token generation per forward pass
and thus reducing serving latency. To improve resource utilization of edge
nodes, we incorporate pipeline parallelism to overlap drafting and verification
across multiple inference tasks. Based on this framework, we analyze and derive
a comprehensive latency model incorporating both communication and inference
latency. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem for speculation
length, task batching, and wireless communication resource allocation to
minimize total serving latency. To address this problem, we derive the
closed-form solutions for wireless communication resource allocation, and
develop a dynamic programming algorithm for joint batching and speculation
control strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves lower serving latency compared to AD-based serving systems.
In addition,the proposed joint optimization method delivers up to 44.9% latency
reduction compared to benchmark schemes.

Abstract: Fiber optic current sensors (FOCS) are widely adopted in modern power grids
due to high sensitivity, excellent insulation, and strong immunity to
electromagnetic interference. This prominence necessitates precise
investigation into their error sources and corresponding optimization. This
study examines reflective FOCS based on the Faraday effect. A theoretical model
is established to simulate phase error caused by linear birefringence from the
quarter-wave plate. Conventional methods using circular birefringence are
analyzed, revealing inherent limitations. Innovatively, a compensation strategy
employing high-order quarter-wave plates is proposed to effectively eliminate
linear birefringence effects. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy
and practicality of FOCS in precision metrology.

Abstract: A data-driven framework is proposed for online estimation of quadrotor motor
efficiency via residual minimization. The problem is formulated as a
constrained nonlinear optimization that minimizes trajectory residuals between
measured flight data and predictions generated by a quadrotor dynamics model. A
sliding-window strategy enables online estimation, and the optimization is
efficiently solved using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) scheme
combined with a primal-dual interior-point method, with inequality constraints
enforced through a logarithmic barrier function. Robust z-score weighting is
employed to reject outliers, which is particularly effective in motor clipping
scenarios where the proposed estimator exhibits smaller spikes than an EKF
baseline. Compared to traditional filter-based approaches, the batch-mode
formulation offers greater flexibility by selectively incorporating informative
data segments. This structure is well-suited for onboard implementation,
particularly for applications such as fault detection and isolation (FDI),
health monitoring, and predictive maintenance in aerial robotic systems.
Simulation results under various degradation scenarios demonstrate the accuracy
and robustness of the proposed estimator.

time-varying hard and soft constraints in uncertain high-relative-degree
nonlinear MIMO systems. These constraints represent spatiotemporal
specifications in mechanical systems' operational space, with hard constraints
ensuring safety-critical requirements and soft constraints encoding performance
or task objectives. Initially, all constraints are consolidated into two
separate scalar time-varying hard and soft constraint functions, whose positive
level sets define feasible regions. A closed-form control law is developed to
enforce these constraints using appropriately designed reciprocal barriers and
nonlinear transformation functions. When conflicts between hard and soft
constraints arise, the control law prioritizes hard constraints by virtually
relaxing soft constraints via a dynamic relaxation law. Notably, the proposed
control law maintains low complexity by avoiding approximation schemes for
coping with system uncertainties. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了信息物理系统(CPS)在遭受执行器使能攻击后的恢复策略，提出了保持系统完整行为并在攻击检测后引导系统进入受限但鲁棒状态的方法，引入了AE-鲁棒可恢复性概念，并通过制造系统案例验证了方案有效性。

Abstract: Critical real-world applications strongly rely on Cyber-physical systems
(CPS), but their dependence on communication networks introduces significant
security risks, as attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to compromise their
integrity and availability. This work explores the topic of cybersecurity in
the context of CPS modeled as discrete event systems (DES), focusing on
recovery strategies following the detection of cyberattacks. Specifically, we
address actuator enablement attacks and propose a method that preserves the
system's full valid behavior under normal conditions. Upon detecting an attack,
our proposed solution aims to guide the system toward a restricted yet robust
behavior, ensuring operational continuity and resilience. Additionally, we
introduce a property termed AE-robust recoverability, which characterizes the
necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering a system from attacks while
preventing further vulnerabilities. Finally, we showcase the proposed solution
through a case study based on a manufacturing system.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅推进了技术前沿，还为需要协调非停飞载具进行载荷运输的未来实际应用提供了可靠、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the first closed-loop control framework for cooperative
payload transportation with non-stopping flying carriers. Building upon
grasp-matrix formulations and internal force redundancy, we propose a feedback
wrench controller that actively regulates the payload's pose while an
optimization layer dynamically shapes internal-force oscillations to guarantee
persistent carrier motion. Preliminary experimental results on multirotor UAVs
validate the model assumptions, and numerical simulations demonstrate that the
method successfully prevents carrier stagnation, achieves accurate load
tracking, and generates physically feasible trajectories with smooth velocity
profiles. The proposed framework not only advances the state of the art but
also offers a reliable, versatile solution for future real-world applications
requiring load transportation by coordinated non-stopping flying carriers.

Motivation: 随着数据中心和电气化带来的电力需求增长，需要在不进行重大基础设施升级的情况下加速大型负荷的互联。柔性连接允许新负荷在电网受限期间推迟或削减用电。

Method: 制定了一个灵活性感知的承载能力分析问题，明确限制每年公用事业控制的干预次数，并开发了高效的非凸问题求解方法，应用于实际负荷数据和测试馈线。

Result: 实证结果显示，适度的灵活性（即少量干预和小的削减或延迟）可以解锁大量的承载能力。

Conclusion: 理论分析进一步解释并推广了这些发现，突显了柔性连接的广泛潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the role of flexible connection in accelerating the
interconnection of large loads amid rising electricity demand from data centers
and electrification. Flexible connection allows new loads to defer or curtail
consumption during rare, grid-constrained periods, enabling faster access
without major infrastructure upgrades. To quantify how flexible connection
unlocks load hosting capacity, we formulate a flexibility-aware hosting
capacity analysis problem that explicitly limits the number of
utility-controlled interventions per year, ensuring infrequent disruption.
Efficient solution methods are developed for this nonconvex problem and applied
to real load data and test feeders. Empirical results reveal that modest
flexibility, i.e., few interventions with small curtailments or delays, can
unlock substantial hosting capacity. Theoretical analysis further explains and
generalizes these findings, highlighting the broad potential of flexible
connection.

Conclusion: 提出的物理信息RL框架能够有效优化CCCV充电协议，使其适应电池长期退化，相比非物理RL代理和固定CCCV协议表现更优。

Abstract: Batteries degrade with usage and continuous cycling. This aging is typically
reflected through the resistance growth and the capacity fade of battery cells.
Over the years, various charging methods have been presented in the literature
that proposed current profiles in order to enable optimal, fast, and/or
health-conscious charging. However, very few works have attempted to make the
ubiquitous Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) charging protocol adaptive
to the changing battery health as it cycles. This work aims to address this gap
and proposes a framework that optimizes the constant current part of the CCCV
protocol adapting to long-term battery degradation. Specifically, a
physics-informed Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach has been used that not
only estimates a key battery degradation mechanism, namely, Loss of Active
Material (LAM), but also adjusts the current magnitude of CCCV as a result of
this particular degradation. The proposed framework has been implemented by
combining PyBamm, an open-source battery modeling tool, and Stable-baselines
where the RL agent was trained using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
network. Simulation results show the potential of the proposed framework for
enhancing the widely used CCCV protocol by embedding physics information in RL
algorithm. A comparative study of this proposed agent has also been discussed
with 2 other charging protocols generated by a non-physics-based RL agent and a
constant CCCV for all the cycles.

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应框架能够有效满足时间约束的到达-规避-停留规范，同时减少控制努力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the issue of controller synthesis for a
control-affine nonlinear system to meet prescribed time reach-avoid-stay
specifications. Our goal is to improve upon previous methods based on
spatiotemporal tubes (STTs) by eliminating the need for circumvent functions,
which often lead to abrupt tube modifications and high control effort. We
propose an adaptive framework that constructs smooth STTs around static unsafe
sets, enabling continuous avoidance while guiding the system toward the target
within the prescribed time. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is
derived to ensure the system trajectory remains within the tube and satisfies
the RAS task. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated
through a case study, showing a significant reduction in control effort
compared to prior methods.

Abstract: We present an analysis on the convergence properties of the so-called
geometric heat flow equation for computing geodesics (shortest-path~curves) on
Riemannian manifolds. Computing geodesics numerically in real-time has become
an important capability in several fields, including control and motion
planning. The geometric heat flow equation involves solving a parabolic partial
differential equation whose solution is a geodesic. In practice, solving this
PDE numerically can be done efficiently, and tends to be more numerically
stable and exhibit a better rate of convergence compared to numerical
optimization. We prove that the geometric heat flow equation is globally
exponentially stable in $L_2$ if the curvature of the Riemannian manifold is
not too positive, and that asymptotic convergence in $L_2$ is always
guaranteed. We also present a pseudospectral method that leverages Chebyshev
polynomials to accurately compute geodesics in only a few milliseconds for
non-contrived manifolds. Our analysis was verified with our custom
pseudospectral method by computing geodesics on common non-Euclidean surfaces,
and in feedback for a contraction-based controller with a non-flat metric for a
nonlinear system.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Conclusion: 需要将视频流分析与多源数据结合，设计实时、响应式、自适应的多层次智能交通系统，使城市出行更智能安全。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Motivation: 当基础模型发布新版本时，即使相同任务已在旧版本中解决，用户仍需重复完整微调。任务向量虽然能捕捉模型对特定任务的适应，但由于参数空间不对齐，往往无法在不同预训练模型间有效迁移。

Method: 提出GradFix方法：1）近似新模型的理想梯度符号结构；2）仅需少量标注样本计算目标模型的几个梯度；3）根据梯度符号结构对源任务向量进行掩码处理，实现局部对齐目标损失景观的任务向量重定基。

Result: 理论证明该方法确保一阶下降。在视觉和语言基准测试中表现出显著性能提升，始终优于朴素任务向量相加和少样本微调方法。

Conclusion: 梯度符号结构是实现任务向量跨模型迁移的关键，GradFix提供了一种高效、无需额外微调的知识迁移方案。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 点集神经网络能有效处理NOvA实验的稀疏2D探测器数据，在显著降低内存需求的同时提高了粒子识别性能。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在扩散概率模型中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而原则性的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于Bode表示的新损失函数log-B和log-BW，用于电化学阻抗谱数据的等效电路模型拟合，通过大规模数据集评估发现X2损失函数在拟合质量上表现最佳，而log-B在计算效率和参数误差方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的电化学阻抗谱数据使用等效电路模型进行拟合，通常采用非线性最小二乘拟合方法。现有损失函数在收敛性、计算效率和拟合质量方面存在局限性，需要开发更优的损失函数。

Method: 基于EIS的Bode表示推导出两种新损失函数log-B和log-BW，使用生成的大规模EIS数据集，评估新损失函数与现有损失函数在R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和平均绝对百分比误差等方面的性能。

Result: 统计比较表明，损失函数的选择影响收敛性、计算效率、拟合质量和MAPE。X2损失函数在多个拟合质量指标上表现最佳，而log-B虽然拟合质量稍低，但计算速度快约1.4倍，且对大多数电路组件产生更低的MAPE。

Conclusion: 当拟合质量是主要目标时，X2损失函数是首选；对于大规模最小二乘拟合的数据驱动应用，log-B是一个强大的替代方案，在计算效率和参数精度方面具有优势。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏有效解决了跨模态哈希中语义信息与多模态数据不兼容的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LMCache是一个高效的KV缓存解决方案，通过跨LLM推理引擎和查询共享KV缓存来提升资源利用率，支持缓存卸载和预填充-解码解耦，与vLLM结合可实现高达15倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统将引擎和查询独立处理导致资源效率低下，虽然已有避免冗余计算和提升GPU利用率的提议，但缺乏高效的KV缓存卸载和通信机制。

Method: LMCache提取并存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，在引擎间共享，支持缓存卸载和预填充-解码解耦，采用批处理数据移动、计算与I/O流水线等优化，提供模块化KV缓存连接器和控制API。

Result: 评估显示LMCache与vLLM结合在各种工作负载下可实现高达15倍的吞吐量提升，已在企业推理系统中得到广泛应用。

Conclusion: LMCache作为首个高效开源KV缓存解决方案，通过优化KV缓存数据移动和灵活缓存编排，显著提升了LLM推理系统的资源效率和性能。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source

Motivation: 传统基于共识的联邦和去中心化学习策略在存在异构本地数据或任务分布时统计上是次优的。现有多任务或个性化策略要么需要精确的先验任务关系知识，要么完全非参数化依赖元学习或近端构造。

Method: 通过建模任务关系为具有未知精度矩阵的高斯马尔可夫随机场，开发了一种联合学习任务关系和局部模型的策略，使代理能够以与其个体数据分布一致的方式自组织。

Result: 理论分析量化了学习到的关系质量，数值实验证明了其实际有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法框架在需要精确先验知识和完全非参数化方法之间找到了平衡，允许代理在追求局部最优模型时相互受益，而无需强制执行共识。

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建可靠、可解释且计算高效的模型提供了实用途径，可支持更安全的药物治疗和临床决策。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 多智能体系统和强化学习被广泛用于增强大语言模型的智能能力，但在多智能体系统中应用在线策略强化学习仍未被充分探索，存在算法和系统层面的挑战。

Method: AT-GRPO包括：(i) 针对多智能体系统定制的智能体和轮次分组强化学习算法；(ii) 支持单策略和多策略机制的训练系统。

Result: 在长期规划任务中，准确率从14.0-47.0%提升到96.0-99.5%；在编程任务上平均提升3.87-7.62%；在数学任务上平均提升9.0-17.93%。

Conclusion: AT-GRPO在多智能体强化学习方面取得了显著进展，为复杂任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and
environments are available at: https://github.com/pettingllms-ai/PettingLLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了乐观Hedge算法在两人零和博弈中的遗憾最优性，改进了现有遗憾分析，证明了社交和个体遗憾上界可达O(√log m log n)，并提供了匹配的算法依赖下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乐观Hedge算法在强非耦合学习动态中具有最佳已知遗憾上界，但其在动作数m和n依赖关系上的最优性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过将遗憾上界表示为关于学习率和负项系数的优化问题，进行精细化分析；提供算法依赖的个体遗憾下界来证明上界的紧致性。

Result: 在强非耦合设置下，社交和个体遗憾上界改进为O(√log m log n)；社交遗憾上下界在主导项常数上完全匹配；改进了最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾。

Conclusion: 乐观Hedge的社交遗憾上界已达到最优，包括常数因子；基于这些结果改进了收敛率和动态遗憾分析。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成精细空间分辨率的合成地理人口数据，为需要详细地理信息的应用开辟了道路，包括洪水响应、流行病传播、疏散规划和交通建模等。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在开发用于反应性材料的AI加速模拟工具时，领域特定考虑因素的重要性，PARCv2为弱到中等冲击条件下的热点形成预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Conclusion: 提出的耦合框架能够实现基于明确定义后验分布的准确递归采样，有效解决逆问题

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的AI工具可以有效地改进因果估计，生成模型的预测能力有助于解决高维因果推断问题，提高估计精度和效率。

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer

these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential

design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

### [278] [Evaluation of Differential Privacy Mechanisms on Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09691)
*Tejash Varsani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了联邦学习中的自适应隐私预算方法，通过Laplace和Gaussian机制实现差分隐私保护，并引入了自适应裁剪技术来动态调整梯度敏感度，以在保护隐私的同时维持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护了原始数据隐私，但固定隐私预算的差分隐私方法在模型收敛时会引入过多噪声，影响模型性能。需要探索自适应隐私预算来平衡隐私保护和模型准确性。

Method: 使用Laplace和Gaussian机制实现差分隐私，在Gaussian机制中引入自适应裁剪方法，动态更新梯度敏感度而非使用固定值。在SelecEval模拟器上进行扩展实验，测试不同隐私预算、IID/非IID数据集和每轮选择客户端数量。

Result: 实验结果表明，自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪方法能够在保护隐私的同时帮助维持模型准确性，尽管实验仅限于200轮训练。

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪是有效的联邦学习隐私保护方法，能够在保证数据隐私的前提下优化模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了三种无网格神经PDE求解器（PINNs、DRM、WANs）在泊松问题和薛定谔方程上的性能，提供了实用选择指南并展示了向复杂问题的迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PDE解析解罕见且网格求解器在高维情况下成本高昂，需要评估神经PDE求解器的实用性和性能。

Method: 在统一协议下比较PINNs、DRM和WANs三种方法，使用强制边界条件、强制节点和正交正则化，测试包括5D泊松问题和1D/2D薛定谔方程。

Result: 所有方法在适当配置下都能达到10^-6到10^-9的低L2误差，PINNs在精度和激发谱恢复方面最可靠，DRM在稳态问题上提供最佳精度-运行时权衡。

Conclusion: 物理引导的神经求解器是解决复杂PDE的可信、可扩展工具，并提出了时间依赖公式、自适应采样等扩展方向。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

*Xiaodan Li,Mengjie Wu,Yao Zhu,Yunna Lv,YueFeng Chen,Cen Chen,Jianmei Guo,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kelp是一个新颖的插件框架，通过在大型模型生成过程中进行流式风险检测，解决了现有后处理检测方法可能暴露不安全内容的问题，实现了更准确的实时风险检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护措施主要采用后处理检测，可能在捕获前暴露不安全内容，且延迟限制使其倾向于使用轻量级模型，限制了检测准确性。

Method: Kelp利用中间隐藏状态通过流式潜在动态头(SLD)建模风险的时间演化，引入锚定时间一致性(ATC)损失来强制执行单调危害预测，并创建了StreamGuardBench基准进行严格评估。

Result: Kelp在各种模型和数据集上始终优于最先进的后处理防护措施和先前的插件探针(平均F1提高15.61%)，仅使用2000万参数，每个token延迟增加不到0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: Kelp提供了一种有效的流式风险检测方法，显著提高了检测准确性，同时保持低延迟和参数效率。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VCON是一种通过平滑过渡方式将神经网络模型压缩的方法，通过在微调期间并行运行原始模型和压缩模型，逐步减少原始模型的贡献并增加压缩模型的贡献，从而减少精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络规模的增大，压缩技术如剪枝、量化和低秩分解变得必要，但这些方法直接应用时会导致严重的精度下降。

Method: 在微调期间并行运行原始模型和压缩模型，逐步减少原始模型的贡献并增加压缩模型的贡献，实现平滑过渡。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，结合多种压缩策略，VCON带来了一致的改进：典型增益超过3%，某些配置的精度提升达到20%。

Conclusion: VCON提供了一个可泛化的方法，可应用于现有的压缩技术，在多个基准测试中显示出持续的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源渗透电网的时域仿真因需要微秒级时间步长而计算困难，阻碍可再生能源稳定集成和气候变化缓解，需要快速可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 使用三种算子学习方法作为仿真替代模型，在简单测试系统上验证时间步长不变性概念，评估零样本超分辨率和稳定/不稳定动态机制间的泛化能力。

Result: 首次证明了时间步长不变性的可行性，使在粗时间步训练的模型能够进行超分辨率推理，并在不同动态机制间实现泛化。

Conclusion: 算子学习方法为解决可再生能源集成中的关键挑战提供了有前景的解决方案，有助于气候变化缓解。

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的特征选择框架，将偏差缓解和特征选择整合在单一学习过程中，通过奖励信号平衡预测性能和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态特征排除策略往往无法防止偏差，因为隐藏的依赖关系会影响模型预测。需要一种动态方法来平衡泛化能力、准确性和公平性。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，构建多组件奖励函数，定义特征子集的动作空间，并与集成学习相结合，实现自适应特征选择。

Result: 该方法能够动态平衡预测性能和公平性考虑，避免传统启发式方法在相关预测因子环境中偏差重新出现的问题。

Conclusion: 该强化学习框架提供了一种灵活通用的特征选择方法，特别适用于预测因子相关且偏差可能无意中重新出现的环境。

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了复数卷积神经网络在音频信号处理中的应用，重点研究如何保留和利用实值网络中常被忽略的相位信息。通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了复数网络在音频分类任务中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值神经网络在处理音频信号时往往忽略相位信息，而相位在音频处理中具有重要价值。研究旨在探索复数神经网络如何更好地保留和利用相位信息来提升音频处理性能。

Method: 提出了复数卷积神经网络的理论框架，包括复数卷积、池化层、基于Wirtinger的微分和各种复数激活函数。采用了复数批归一化和权重初始化方案确保训练稳定性。通过三个阶段进行实证评估：图像数据集基准测试、基于MFCC的音频分类、以及引入图神经网络建模相位信息。

Result: 在图像数据集上，复数CNN与实值CNN表现相当；在音频分类中，复数CNN在实值MFCC上略优于实值CNN；通过图神经网络建模相位信息，在二元和多类流派分类中都取得了可衡量的性能提升。

Conclusion: 复数架构具有强大的表达能力，相位是音频处理中有意义且可利用的特征。虽然当前方法（特别是cardioid激活函数）显示出潜力，但未来需要开发更多相位感知设计来充分发挥复数表示在神经网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于心理学的分组自适应对抗训练方法，通过将对抗性评论分为感知、认知和社会三个类别，利用LLMs生成多样化攻击，并采用Dirichlet自适应采样机制来增强假新闻检测模型的鲁棒性。

Motivation: 现有假新闻检测模型在标准设置下表现良好，但容易受到真实用户或大型语言模型生成的对抗性评论的攻击，这些评论会微妙地改变模型决策，影响检测准确性。

Method: 1. 将对抗性评论分为三个心理学基础类别：感知、认知和社会；2. 使用LLMs生成多样化的类别特定攻击以增强对抗训练；3. 应用基于Dirichlet的自适应采样机制，在训练过程中动态调整不同评论类别的学习重点。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持强检测准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种对抗性评论扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的分组自适应对抗训练策略有效提升了假新闻检测模型对对抗性攻击的防御能力，为构建更可靠的假新闻检测系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏统计保证，或依赖于易被违反的强假设，需要一种能严格控制错误发现率的训练数据识别方法

Method: 使用已知未见数据计算每个数据点的p值，构建测试集数据使用比例的保守估计量来缩放p值，然后基于数据依赖阈值选择训练数据集

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的实验表明，PTDI能严格控制错误发现率并获得更高的检测能力

Conclusion: PTDI方法为训练数据识别提供了严格的统计保证，在版权诉讼、隐私审计和公平评估方面具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

Motivation: 解决联邦聚类问题，使互联设备能够在不共享本地数据集的情况下联合聚类整体数据，保护数据隐私。

Result: 开发出隐私友好的联邦k-means算法，仅需在互联设备间共享聚合信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在保护隐私的前提下进行联邦聚类，为分布式环境下的数据聚类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

Result: 大五人格模型在描述在线社区方面远优于机器学习聚类模型，后者未能提供有意义的区分、无法恢复外向性特质、缺乏心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: 大五人格模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构是情境依赖的。机器学习可以检验心理学理论的生态效度，但可能无法替代它们。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型路由方法依赖准确的模型表示，添加新模型通常需要重新训练，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 查询嵌入和投影到向量空间，训练投影器和基于LLM的路由器重构原始查询；2) 基于查询和模型性能的上下文向量，路由器学习预测模型是否能正确回答新查询。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中实现了最先进的路由性能，能够无缝集成新模型而无需重新训练路由器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文向量有效表示模型能力，显著提升了模型路由的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

Motivation: 开发一种完全基于自然语言定义模型的方法，通过解释性提示迭代改进分类标准，而不是依赖传统的数值优化技术。

Method: 使用自然语言完全定义模型，通过解释性提示进行迭代细化分类标准，在3个合成数据集和3个自然数据集上进行实验，并与7个基线可解释机器学习模型进行比较。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文探索了在过程模型发现中通过逐步减少行为输入来保持LLM生成解释质量的方法，发现在适度减少输入的情况下解释质量基本保持不变，为资源受限环境下的过程分析提供了可行路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地用于生成过程模型的文本解释，但从大型行为抽象（如直接跟随图或Petri网）生成解释计算成本高昂，因此需要探索在输入减少情况下保持解释质量的方法。

Method: 采用渐进式行为输入减少方法，从固定事件日志的逐步缩小前缀中发现模型，建立包含模型发现、LLM生成解释和第二个LLM评估解释质量的三步流程。

Result: 在合成日志上的实验表明，在适度减少输入的情况下，解释质量基本保持不变，显示了实用的成本-质量权衡。

Conclusion: 这项探索性研究表明，在资源受限环境下，通过渐进式输入减少可以实现计算效率更高、LLM辅助的过程分析，但需要注意评估分数基于LLM而非真实基准，且数据为合成的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in

### [292] [ARROW: An Adaptive Rollout and Routing Method for Global Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09734)
*Jindong Tian,Yifei Ding,Ronghui Xu,Hao Miao,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ARROW方法，一种用于全球天气预报的自适应滚动多尺度时间路由方法，解决了现有方法在空间多尺度时间依赖建模和滚动策略平衡方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预报方法通常基于固定短时间间隔建模，依赖简单的自回归滚动进行长期预测，存在两个关键限制：1) 无法充分建模全球天气系统的空间和多尺度时间依赖；2) 滚动策略难以平衡误差积累与精细大气变化捕捉。

Method: 构建多间隔预测模型，使用共享-私有专家混合机制捕获不同时间尺度的共享模式和特定特征，采用环形位置编码准确表示地球的圆形纬度结构。开发基于强化学习的自适应滚动调度器，根据当前天气状态选择最合适的时间间隔进行预测。

Result: 实验结果表明ARROW在全球天气预报中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARROW为天气预报领域建立了一个有前景的范式。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

*Qianyou Sun,Jiexin Zheng,Bohan Jin,Lihua Chen,Yijie Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InterCorpRel-LLM跨模态框架，整合图神经网络和大型语言模型，用于识别企业间供应和竞争关系，在供应链关系识别任务上显著优于GPT-5等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业间关系识别对金融分析和公司治理至关重要，但面临数据规模大、稀疏性强和上下文依赖等挑战。图方法缺乏语义深度，而LLM在关系依赖表示方面有限。

Method: 提出InterCorpRel-LLM框架，集成GNN和LLM，使用FactSet供应链记录构建专有数据集，设计三个训练任务：公司图匹配、行业分类和供应关系预测。

Result: 在供应链关系识别任务上，仅使用7B参数骨干网络和轻量训练就实现0.8543的F分数，显著优于GPT-5的0.2287，并能零样本泛化到竞争者识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析师和策略师提供了强大的工具，用于映射和推理复杂的企业网络，增强动态市场中的决策制定和风险管理能力。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于多LLM的管道系统，通过描述性提示分类论文并使用共识机制联合决策，显著减少系统文献综述的手动工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统文献综述的文献检索和筛选过程耗时且需要大量人工努力，传统基于关键词的搜索方法会返回大量不相关文献。

Method: 使用多个大语言模型构建管道，基于描述性提示对论文进行分类，采用共识方案进行联合决策，整个过程通过开源可视化分析界面LLMSurver进行人工监督和交互控制。

Result: 在包含8000多篇候选论文的真实数据集上评估，该方法显著减少手动工作量，且错误率低于单个人类标注者，现代开源模型足以胜任此任务。

Conclusion: 负责任的人机协作可以加速和增强学术工作流程中的系统文献综述，使该方法易于获取且成本效益高。

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出NCAL-R框架，利用深度网络的几何规律性来应对主动学习中的不可靠监督问题，通过类均值对齐扰动和特征波动评分来选择样本，在噪声标签和数据分布偏移情况下表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在标签噪声和数据分布偏移时不可靠，因为不确定性、多样性等启发式方法会放大错误标签或冗余样本的影响。

Method: 结合两种互补信号：类均值对齐扰动评分（量化样本对类间几何结构的影响）和特征波动评分（捕捉训练过程中表示的时间不稳定性），优先选择能保持类别分离并突出模糊区域的样本。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上的实验表明，NCAL-R优于标准主动学习基线，用更少标签获得更高准确率，在合成标签噪声下更鲁棒，对分布外数据泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入样本选择决策可以使主动学习对标注错误和分布偏移更具鲁棒性，是实现真实世界标注管道可信部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

Experiments reveal it surpasses text only methods, producing outputs with
greater fidelity and alignment with human written standards. Its incorporation
of visual data allows it to better represent intricate design features and
functional connections, leading to richer and more precise results. This study
underscores the value of multimodal techniques in patent automation, providing
a scalable tool to reduce manual workloads and improve consistency.
PatentVision not only advances patent drafting but also lays the groundwork for
broader use of LVLMs in specialized areas, potentially transforming

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoMM是一个新颖的自监督学习框架，通过共享原型字典将异质模态锚定在共同嵌入空间中，解决了传统对比学习方法在多模态时间序列数据中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方法依赖CLIP风格的对比目标，容易过拟合到易于对齐的特征，并将有效的跨模态关系误分类为负样本，导致碎片化和不可泛化的嵌入。

Method: 引入共享原型字典，通过将表示聚类到共享原型周围而不是显式负采样，捕获跨模态的互补信息，为生理信号提供连贯的"共同语言"。

Result: ProtoMM在Pulse Motion基础模型上优于仅对比方法和先前的多模态SSL方法，实现了最先进的性能，同时提高了学习特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: ProtoMM框架通过共享原型字典有效解决了多模态时间序列数据建模中的挑战，为生理信号分析提供了更优的表示学习方法。

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

TL;DR: 提出HeSRN模型，通过槽感知结构编码器和保留机制编码器，在异构图上实现高效且表达力强的表示学习，解决了传统图Transformer的二次计算复杂度和语义混合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图Transformer在捕捉长距离依赖方面表现出色，但其二次计算复杂度和无法有效建模异构语义的问题限制了在真实世界异构图上的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 引入槽感知结构编码器将异构特征投影到独立槽中，通过槽归一化和保留融合对齐分布；用保留机制编码器替代自注意力，在线性时间复杂度的同时保持强表达能力；使用异构保留编码器联合捕捉局部结构信号和全局异构语义。

Result: 在四个真实世界异构图数据集上的实验表明，HeSRN在节点分类任务上持续优于最先进的异构图神经网络和图Transformer基线，以显著更低的计算复杂度获得更优的准确率。

Conclusion: HeSRN通过解耦异构语义和线性时间复杂度的保留机制，为异构图表示学习提供了高效且表达力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Motivation: 研究等变性架构在原子间势能学习任务中的缩放特性，验证对称性等归纳偏置对模型性能的影响，特别是在大规模场景下的重要性。

Method: 通过经验性研究分析不同架构在原子间势能学习任务中的表现，比较等变性与非等变性架构，以及不同阶数表示的缩放行为。

Result: 发现等变性架构比非等变性模型缩放更好，高阶表示对应更好的缩放指数，且计算最优训练需要数据和模型规模同步缩放。

Conclusion: 对称性等基础归纳偏置不应留给模型自行发现，特别是在大规模场景下，因为它们改变了任务的固有难度和缩放规律。

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的局限性，证明线性自注意力模型无法超越经典线性模型，并解释了为什么强大的Transformer在实际中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在时间序列预测中应用广泛，但实证显示Transformer往往无法超越简单线性模型。本文旨在从理论角度深入理解这一现象。

Method: 通过In-Context Learning理论分析，在AR(p)数据假设下，对线性自注意力模型进行理论推导，并通过精心设计的实验进行验证。

Result: 理论证明：(1)线性自注意力模型无法获得比经典线性模型更低的期望MSE；(2)当上下文长度趋于无穷时，LSA渐近恢复最优线性预测器；(3)在思维链推理下，预测会指数级塌缩到均值。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的根本理论局限，建议研究社区重新审视TSF的基本理论限制，并对复杂架构的直接应用进行更严格的评估。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 现有防护措施主要在行动执行后介入，难以扩展且缺乏对计划层面的可控监督，某些风险一旦执行会造成严重后果。

Method: 提出AuraGen可控引擎合成良性轨迹并注入风险，开发Safiron防护模型结合跨规划器适配器，训练分两阶段进行。

Conclusion: 为更安全的智能体系统提供了实用模板，通过填补数据、模型和评估三个关键缺口，实现了对计划风险的预执行检测。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维空间中，生成建模变得数据密集，而分子科学中数据收集昂贵且重要事件罕见，因此需要压缩到低维流形以支持下游任务。

Method: 结合时间滞后信息瓶颈（用于表征分子重要表示）和扩散模型，在一个联合训练目标中实现表示学习和生成。

Result: 在多个分子任务上进行了基准测试，展示了探索训练集外物理条件的潜力，能够结合不同分子模拟轨迹的温度信息学习连贯的热力学内部表示。

Conclusion: D-SPIB提供了一个灵活的架构，能够平衡表示学习和生成目标，在分子科学中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的FNOtD方法，通过引入时间傅里叶模态和色散关系，显著提升了神经算子在海洋PDE预测中的长期稳定性和物理一致性。


<details>

Motivation: 解决神经算子在天气和海洋预报中长期预测稳定性不足、物理规律遵循性差的问题，特别是在高频过程预测中的挑战。

Method: 开发FNOtD变体，在标准傅里叶神经算子基础上融入时间傅里叶模态，内化色散关系，通过时空纠缠训练积分核来捕捉多尺度波传播。

Result: FNOtD相比标准FNO显著改善了长期预测稳定性和物理动态一致性，在计算成本显著降低的同时，与最先进的数值海洋模型具有竞争力的预测能力。

Conclusion: 通过时空纠缠和色散关系内化，FNOtD为高频海洋动力学预测提供了一种计算高效且物理一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究发现神经网络中的可解码性和因果性之间存在系统性不匹配：中间层的对象标记具有强因果影响但可解码性弱，而最终层的对象标记可解码性强但因果影响弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是厘清神经网络中经常被混淆的两个概念：可解码性（从隐藏状态恢复信息的能力）和因果性（这些状态对输出的功能影响程度）。

Method: 使用激活修补技术在视觉变换器（ViTs）中测试空间和CLS标记的因果作用，同时训练线性探针评估不同深度的计数信息可解码性。

Result: 结果显示中间层对象标记具有强因果影响但可解码性弱，最终层对象标记可解码性强但因果影响弱；CLS标记在中间层变得可解码但仅在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——存在什么信息与使用什么信息——它们的分歧可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的框架来封装各种提升训练策略，通过将嵌套优化问题转化为高维约束优化问题，使用Bregman距离等凸优化工具来改善训练条件，支持分布式优化和非可微激活函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的深度神经网络训练面临梯度消失/爆炸、非光滑激活函数困难和顺序结构限制并行化等问题，需要替代的训练方法。

Method: 引入提升训练框架，将嵌套优化转化为高维约束优化问题，使用惩罚项替代直接约束，结合Bregman距离等凸优化工具，采用块坐标下降策略实现。

Result: 数值实验表明，在标准成像任务中，提升Bregman方法相比传统训练更有效和稳定，特别适用于使用近端激活函数的架构。

Conclusion: 提升训练框架为深度神经网络训练提供了有前景的替代方案，能够改善训练条件，支持分布式优化，并有效处理非可微激活函数。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

Motivation: 解决连续时间动力系统中存在的近奇异行为问题，同时保持系统的守恒律，为机器学习动力学提供稳定化方法。

Method: 引入平滑单调映射t↦τ(t)进行时间重参数化，在提升坐标中使轨迹全局光滑化，作为连续时间归一化或时间扭曲算子。

Result: 该方法能使不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程在环面T³上的轨迹变得全局光滑，可稳定物理信息神经网络和其他潜在流架构。

Conclusion: 时间提升框架将解析正则性理论与表示学习方法联系起来，适用于刚性或湍流过程的建模。

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

TL;DR: 本文系统探索了神经网络中梯度下降方法的规范选择，提出了新的MuonMax优化器及其Momo变体，这些方法对超参数调整更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在神经网络中定义最速下降法，需要为每层选择规范、跨层聚合规范的方式以及是否使用归一化。本文旨在系统探索这些选择，改进现有优化器的鲁棒性。

Method: 将Adam和Muon形式化为非欧几里得梯度下降类型，推导Muon优化器的新变体，并将非欧几里得梯度方法与模型动量(Momo)相结合。

Result: Muon对学习率选择敏感，而新提出的MuonMax显著更鲁棒。Momo变体的Muon对超参数调整更鲁棒，通常获得更好的验证分数。

Conclusion: 对于新任务，建议使用Momo与MuonMax组合，以节省昂贵的超参数调整成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将语言模型的模式识别能力成功应用于表格数据的复杂性，实现了准确且可推广的因果发现。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化路由器需要重新训练和维护开销，非参数化路由器虽然免训练但难以泛化到异常查询，且训练集多样性有限且难以跟上用例演变。

Method: 使用指数倾斜聚合机制来平衡非参数路由器中的偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明ProxRouter在保持正常查询性能的同时，显著提升了异常查询的路由效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ProxRouter通过创新的聚合机制有效解决了非参数路由器在异常查询上的泛化问题，为LLM查询路由提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

Conclusion: 掌握网页子任务对于稳健的网页导航至关重要，这是现有基准测试未充分评估的能力。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯决策理论为主动学习提供了坚实的理论基础，ParBaLS方法有效解决了批量选择中的扩展性问题，在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化且上下文感知的嵌入，推进了连续时间动态图学习的最新技术水平。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒损失的泛化误差界不能真实反映样本外性能，且在无界函数空间和重尾噪声下，标准分析工具失效。需要找到更合适的性能度量方法和分析框架。

Method: 引入概率有效假设空间来约束估计量，建立连接过剩鲁棒风险与L2预测误差的比较定理，在RKHS中进行Tikhonov正则化风险最小化，特别关注Huber回归。

Conclusion: 预测误差而非过剩泛化风险是分析鲁棒学习的基本视角，研究提供了原则性的调参规则，且方法可扩展到Huber之外的其他鲁棒损失。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

Conclusion: 该概率性误差校正框架能够有效改善北极海冰浓度季节性预测的准确性和不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

*Yubo Li,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Chain-of-Influence (CoI)框架，通过多级注意力机制显式建模临床时间序列数据中特征间的时变依赖关系，提供可解释的预测路径追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉临床时间序列数据中潜在的时变特征依赖关系，通常依赖黑盒机制或简单聚合，无法显式建模临床变量随时间传播的影响。

Method: CoI框架采用多级注意力架构：时间注意力层识别关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模这些时间点上特征对后续特征的定向影响，构建显式的时间展开特征交互图。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和私有慢性肾病队列上的死亡率和疾病进展任务中，CoI在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能揭示具有临床意义的患者特异性疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI提供了前所未有的透明度，能够追踪任何特征在任何时间点对最终预测的直接和间接贡献，为临床决策提供清晰的时变和跨特征依赖关系洞察。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

*Hung Phan,Son Le Vu,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2J是一个提示增强框架，通过构建包含常见错误和修复的固定错误数据集，为轻量级LLM提供结构化指导，显著提升PyTorch到JAX的代码翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX虽然都嵌入在Python中，但在核心设计、执行语义和生态系统成熟度上存在差异。JAX较新且在公共代码中代表性不足，平行PyTorch-JAX语料库有限，现有评估方法在跨框架基准测试中存在弱点。

Method: 构建两阶段流程：(1) 使用GPT-4o-mini从TorchLeet和CodeParrot的PyTorch源代码生成初始JAX草稿；(2) 专业开发者迭代修复草稿直至功能等价，构建包含常见错误和补丁的固定错误数据集；(3) 基于这些修复构建增强提示来指导轻量级LLM。

Result: T2J将GPT-4o-mini在CodeBLEU上的性能提升高达10%，在T2J修复成本评分上提升50%，在T2J代码翻译评分(0-4分制)上提升1.33分，在T2J比较评分上提升100%。生成的代码运行速度比基线快2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架通过结构化指导和专业修复，有效解决了PyTorch到JAX代码翻译的挑战，显著提升了翻译质量和效率。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer中LayerNorm的不同放置位置进行了系统性研究，分析了前向传播（隐藏状态）和后向传播（梯度）的稳定性，为Transformer训练动态提供了理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer被广泛使用，但其训练过程可能不稳定。LayerNorm作为标准组件能提高训练稳定性，但其放置位置往往缺乏理论依据，需要系统研究。

Method: 通过理论分析研究不同LayerNorm放置位置下Transformer的前向稳定性（隐藏状态增长边界）和后向稳定性（梯度反向传播动态），并指导残差连接步长的缩放策略。

Result: 理论分析揭示了不同LayerNorm放置对训练动态的影响，数值实验结果验证了理论发现，表明适当的LayerNorm放置和残差步长缩放能显著改善训练稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一个理论框架来评估Transformer在不同架构修改下的稳定性，为未来Transformer设计提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based
generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from
large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

Abstract: Excess alcohol consumption leads to serious health risks and severe
consequences for both individuals and their communities. To advocate for
healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,

evaluation of different state-of-the-art classifiers such as the Transformer,
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN), and Hyperdimensional

TL;DR: AutoGD：一种自动调整学习率的梯度下降方法，无需用户手动调参即可实现收敛，并能恢复标准GD的最优收敛速率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度优化方法（如标准梯度下降）的性能高度依赖学习率的选择，但手动调整学习率需要大量用户调参工作，特别是在作为其他算法内循环时更不实用

Method: 提出AutoGD方法，在每次迭代时自动判断是增加还是减少学习率，无需知道平滑度常数，并扩展到AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS

Result: 在传统问题和变分推断优化任务上的实验表明该方法表现优异，能够恢复标准GD的最优收敛速率（最多相差一个常数）

Conclusion: AutoGD为梯度优化方法提供了自动学习率调整的有效解决方案，特别适用于需要内循环优化的场景

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemPromptTSS是一个用于多粒度时间序列分割的框架，通过引入持久提示记忆来解决现有方法中提示信号影响范围有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割方法中的提示机制只能在局部上下文中起作用，提示的影响会快速消失，无法在整个序列中指导预测。需要一种能够使提示影响持久化的方法。

Method: 提出MemPromptTSS框架，包含记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为记忆令牌存储在记忆库中，使每个新预测不仅基于局部线索，还能基于所有累积的提示。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示，MemPromptTSS在单次迭代推理中比最佳基线在单粒度和多粒度分割上分别提升23%和85%的准确率，在迭代推理中每轮平均增益为2.66个百分点，优于PromptTSS的1.19。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对于提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS为实际应用提供了一个实用有效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Motivation: 边缘-云推测解码中，边缘设备与云服务器之间的有限带宽成为关键瓶颈，需要高效压缩草稿令牌分布。

Method: 提出了SQS-SD框架，包括结构化稀疏化和基于格子的量化。K-SQS使用固定的top-K截断，C-SQS通过在线符合预测自适应调整保留的令牌集。

Result: 两种方法在互补的操作机制下都改善了端到端延迟和拒绝率。

Conclusion: 信息论分析表明令牌拒绝率来自SLM-LLM分布不匹配和量化失真，SQS-SD框架通过利用分布稀疏性有效解决了带宽限制问题。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

Motivation: 传统不完全多视图谱聚类需要在特征提取后执行K-means算法生成聚类结果，且未能有效利用样本连通性信息。

Method: CRG_IMSC通过对提取特征施加非负约束直接获得聚类结果，根据谱聚类结果构建连通性矩阵，并基于该矩阵最小化自表示残差，使用乘法更新算法求解优化问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CRG_IMSC比现有最先进的聚类方法表现更好，实验验证了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC有效解决了传统不完全多视图谱聚类的缺陷，实现了更好的聚类性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型如OpenVLA、Octo和π₀虽然通过大规模演示数据展现了良好的泛化能力，但其性能仍受限于监督数据的质量和覆盖范围。强化学习提供了通过在线交互改进这些模型的途径，但传统策略梯度方法在流匹配模型中由于重要性采样过程的难处理性而无法应用。

Method: FPO算法通过利用条件流匹配目标中每个样本的变化来重新构建重要性采样。集成了结构感知信用分配以增强梯度效率、裁剪替代目标以稳定优化、多步潜在探索以鼓励多样化的策略更新，以及Q集成机制以提供稳健的价值估计。

Result: 在LIBERO基准和ALOHA模拟任务上的评估显示，FPO相比监督学习、偏好对齐、基于扩散的方法、自回归在线RL和π₀-FAST基线方法，在模仿先验和稀疏奖励下都实现了持续改进和稳定学习。

Conclusion: 消融研究和潜在空间动态分析进一步验证了FPO中各个组件的贡献，证明了所提出的计算模块的有效性以及条件流匹配目标在在线强化学习中的稳定收敛性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

Conclusion: 联合嵌入方法优于单图模型，证明了多视角图表示在软件分析中的价值。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

Result: 在广泛评估中，该方法在保持竞争性鲁棒精度的同时，提供了比现有方法更紧的证书。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效解决WDRO中的上界过松和计算复杂性问题，为对抗鲁棒性提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BITE是一个双向时频金字塔网络，通过多流协同、金字塔时频注意力和双向自适应卷积，解决了EEG识别模型跨范式泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG识别模型由于数据集特定约束和个体变异性，在跨范式泛化方面表现不佳，需要开发统一的架构来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出BITE端到端统一架构，包含对齐的时频流、金字塔时频注意力机制和双向自适应卷积，实现双向神经动态建模和多尺度特征增强。

Result: 在四个不同范式数据集上达到最先进性能，在受试者内准确性和跨受试者泛化方面表现优异，兼具计算效率。

Conclusion: 验证了范式对齐的频谱-时间处理对于可靠脑机接口系统的重要性，BITE架构能够有效提升EEG识别性能。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

TL;DR: STAT是一种新的微调策略，利用更强LLM的元认知能力作为教师，通过识别学生模型的缺失技能并针对性训练，显著提升数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在类似训练数据上往往出现性能饱和现象，需要更有效的训练策略来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 使用强LLM教师分析任务所需技能，标记数据点的技能需求，监控学生回答创建缺失技能档案，通过STAT-Sel重加权训练样本或STAT-Syn合成新样本来针对性训练。

Result: 在MATH数据集上提升达7.5%，在分布外基准上平均提升4.6%，且与GRPO强化学习方法互补。

Conclusion: 基于技能的适应性训练应广泛改进当前训练流程，有效解决模型技能缺失问题。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机搭载视觉语言模型在低空经济网络中具有广泛应用前景，但受限于机载资源和动态网络条件，如何同时保证推理精度和通信效率是一个重要挑战。

Method: 首先建立了包含无人机移动性、用户-无人机通信和机载视觉问答管道的系统模型，然后设计了分层优化框架：ARPO算法用于精度约束下的资源分配，LLaRA方法利用大语言模型优化强化学习的奖励设计以实现自适应轨迹优化。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决无人机视觉语言模型在低空经济网络中的实时多模态推理问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过联合优化资源分配和轨迹规划实现了性能提升。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

TL;DR: PPOPT是一种新的无模型深度强化学习算法，通过预训练在物理环境中实现高训练效率和稳定性，特别适用于小样本训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要大量环境交互，计算成本高。PPOPT旨在通过预训练提高训练效率，减少复杂环境中的计算开销。

Method: 采用包含预训练神经网络中间层的新策略网络架构，在具有相似物理特性的不同环境中预训练部分网络，然后迁移到目标环境。

Result: PPOPT在小样本训练中优于经典PPO，在奖励获取和训练稳定性方面表现更好。虽然不如DYNA DDPG等基于模型的方法，但训练时间显著更短。

Conclusion: PPOPT通过预训练实现了高效的模型无关强化学习，在小样本场景下具有优势，并已开源实现。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Motivation: 解决小规模和类别不平衡生物医学数据集中深度学习模型优化不稳定和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 使用softmax不确定性作为样本难度度量，构建四阶段课程学习（简单-非常困难），将FOSSIL集成到卷积和transformer架构中用于Mpox皮肤病诊断。

Result: 在所有设置下，FOSSIL显著改善了判别能力（AUC=0.9573）、校准性（ECE=0.053）以及在真实世界扰动下的鲁棒性，优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: FOSSIL是一个可泛化、数据高效且可解释的框架，适用于数据稀缺条件下医学影像的难度感知学习。

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

TL;DR: 提出One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP)框架，解决3D装箱问题中稳定性约束和跨维度泛化问题，通过加权奖励函数和策略漂移方法提升装箱效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法忽视实际稳定性约束，且在不同箱子维度间泛化能力有限，需要开发能处理多种箱子尺寸并考虑支撑和重量约束的解决方案。

Method: 使用深度强化学习框架，结合加权奖励函数（整合装载率和高度差指标）和策略漂移方法（防止策略熵崩溃），促进更平坦的装箱配置。

Result: O4M-SP在不同箱子维度上成功泛化，显著优于基线方法，并能有效处理具有稳定性约束的实际装箱场景。

Conclusion: O4M-SP框架在3D装箱问题上表现出色，解决了稳定性约束和跨维度泛化问题，具有强实用性。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

Motivation: 自注意力能自适应识别相关元素但依赖绝对位置嵌入，卷积具有相对编码优势但固定核大小限制自适应选择能力，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出Translution操作统一自注意力的自适应识别和卷积的相对编码，并开发轻量级α-Translution变体以减少参数数量。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务上的实验表明，Translution（包括α-Translution）相比自注意力获得更优的准确率。

Conclusion: Translution成功结合了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持高性能的同时通过轻量级变体解决了计算资源限制问题。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统的持续预训练方法存在灾难性遗忘和领域容量有限的问题，现有层扩展策略的均匀扩展和更新仍然会纠缠通用和领域学习，影响效果。

Method: ADEPT包含两个阶段：1) 通用能力引导的选择性层扩展，复制对通用领域最不关键的层；2) 自适应单元解耦调优，根据通用领域重要性分离参数单元并分配非对称学习率。

Result: 在数学和医学基准测试中，ADEPT仅使用15%的参数和不到50%的训练时间，就在通用领域上比全参数持续预训练提升5.76%，在目标领域提升5.58%。

Conclusion: ADEPT证明了针对性扩展和解耦优化的必要性，为高效鲁棒的领域自适应持续预训练提供了新原则。

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 深度学习模型在时间序列分类中表现出色，但可能依赖训练数据中的伪相关性，影响泛化能力。目前对时间序列中捷径行为的研究不足，大多依赖外部属性而非内部偏差行为。

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

Motivation: 循环注意力机制在复杂推理任务中表现优于标准注意力机制，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在从损失景观几何的角度解释这一现象。

Method: 扩展River-Valley景观模型，区分U形谷（平坦）和V形谷（陡峭），基于经验观察推测循环注意力的递归架构诱导了向River-V-Valley的景观级归纳偏置，并提出了SHIFT分阶段训练框架。

Result: 理论推导表明基于这种归纳偏置，循环注意力在河流方向上有更好的损失收敛性，并鼓励学习复杂模式，相比标准注意力诱导的River-U-Valley具有优势。

Conclusion: 循环注意力的递归架构在损失景观层面产生了有利于复杂推理的归纳偏置，SHIFT框架能够加速其训练过程同时保持可比性能。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

TL;DR: 该研究通过着色算法理论解释了图神经网络表达力与泛化能力之间的权衡关系，证明更强的表达力会导致更高的Rademacher复杂度，从而削弱泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然表达能力更强的GNNs能够区分更多类型的图，但实际观察到它们往往具有更高的泛化误差。本研究旨在从理论上解释这种表达力与泛化能力之间的权衡关系。

Method: 通过将WL着色算法诱导的等价类数量与GNNs的Rademacher复杂度联系起来，建立了表达力与泛化能力的理论联系。该方法不仅限于消息传递GNNs或1-WL，可扩展到任意GNN架构和表达力度量。

Result: 证明WL着色诱导的等价类数量直接限制了GNNs的Rademacher复杂度，且该复杂度在不同样本的着色计数扰动下保持稳定，确保了数据集采样变异性下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究统一了GNNs表达力与泛化能力的研究，为理解增加表达力往往以牺牲泛化为代价提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

Motivation: 现有方法使用预定义规则或从驾驶数据学习生成轨迹，近期利用LLMs进行决策，但LLMs是否真正理解人类驾驶逻辑仍不明确。

Method: 基于人类推理模式和交通规则推导结构化驾驶指令，通过Align2ActChain模块进行逐步推理，使用LoRA在nuPlan数据集上微调LLaMA-2-7B。

Result: 在Test14-random上获得85.17开环分数和70.31（非反应式）/66.96（反应式）闭环分数，在真实世界nuPlan闭环基准上表现出改进的规划质量和人类相似性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著优于基线LLM规划器，证明了将LLMs与人类驾驶逻辑对齐的有效性。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能封装广泛的世界知识，但在建模用户交互历史中的行为知识方面存在局限。用户行为构成一个独特的模态，其中每个动作都包含时间、上下文和交易类型等多维属性，形成行为标记。建模这些高基数序列具有挑战性，判别模型在有限监督下往往表现不佳。

Method: PANTHER框架包含：(1) 结构化标记化将多维交易属性压缩为可解释词汇；(2) 序列模式识别模块建模周期性交易模式；(3) 统一用户画像嵌入融合静态人口统计信息和动态交易历史；(4) 通过离线缓存预训练嵌入实现毫秒级推理的实时可扩展性。

Result: 在微信支付完全部署运行，PANTHER在下次交易预测HitRate@1上提升了25.6%，在欺诈检测召回率上相对基线改进了38.6%。在公共基准测试的跨域评估中表现出强泛化能力，相比Transformer基线实现了高达21%的HitRate@1增益。

Conclusion: PANTHER被确立为一个可扩展、高性能的工业级序列用户行为建模框架，成功将生成式预训练应用于用户行为建模，实现了显著的性能提升和实际部署价值。

encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lighter-X是一个高效模块化框架，通过压缩稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵，将GNN推荐系统的参数复杂度从O(n×d)降低到O(h×d)，显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统（如LightGCN）需要为每个节点维护大小为d的嵌入，导致参数复杂度为O(n×d)，在大规模图应用中面临可扩展性挑战。

Method: 分析原始结构和参数冗余性，提出稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的高效压缩方案，采用解耦框架优化模型，降低训练过程中的计算复杂度。

Result: 在大规模交互图上，Lighter-X仅使用LightGCN 1%的参数就能达到相当甚至更好的性能。

Conclusion: Lighter-X框架显著提升了GNN推荐系统的可扩展性，使其能够在保持性能的同时实现大规模实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好驱动的知识蒸馏框架，结合LLMs和GNNs的优势进行少样本节点分类，通过GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器和节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器实现高效知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs依赖人工标注标签且难以处理复杂多样的局部拓扑结构，LLMs在少样本学习上表现良好但存在可扩展性问题，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 开发GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器促进LLMs到教师GNNs的预测蒸馏，以及节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器为每个节点选择最合适的教师GNN进行定制化知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界文本属性图上的大量实验验证了该框架在少样本节点分类中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了LLMs和GNNs的互补优势，为少样本节点分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip是一个解决RAG系统中TTFT瓶颈的新框架，通过辅助LLM识别关键token来选择性重新计算KV缓存，实现快速首token时间和高质量生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存重用方法在RAG场景中存在根本性权衡：前缀缓存需要相同前缀但RAG中很少出现，直接预计算会因缺少跨块注意力和重复注意力下沉而牺牲质量。

Method: 集成三种技术：(1)辅助模型引导的token选择用于选择性KV缓存重新计算，(2)共享前缀消除冗余注意力下沉，(3)分组策略在部分KV缓存更新时保持局部连贯性。

Result: 在NIAH和LongBench上分别保持94.8%和85.0%的全注意力性能，比APE和CacheBlend在NIAH上分别提升25.2%和35.1%，预填充时间加速达1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip为RAG系统中的效率-质量权衡提供了实用解决方案，实现了快速TTFT和高质量生成的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要能够泛化到未见场景的算法，而现有的基于模型强化学习算法对环境变化敏感，特别是在对抗性驾驶场景中表现不佳。

Method: 将头对头赛车任务建模为上下文马尔可夫决策过程，参数化对手的驾驶行为，提出上下文感知的cMask扩展方法。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的MBRL方法能够显著提升自动驾驶赛车任务中的泛化能力，cMask方法在对抗不同驾驶行为时表现优异。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Motivation: 传统通道置换方法依赖手工设计的质量指标，难以准确捕捉剪枝对模型性能的真实影响，需要更智能的优化方法。

Method: 使用可学习的通道置换(LCP)，结合Sinkhorn归一化处理置换矩阵，并采用高效的块级通道置换策略减少参数和计算复杂度。

Result: 在LLaMA系列、Qwen和OPT模型上的广泛实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: PermLLM框架通过可学习的通道置换有效缓解了剪枝引起的误差，为N:M稀疏模型提供了更优的优化方案。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Conclusion: 深度学习天气预报模型存在对抗攻击漏洞，Cyc-Attack为评估和改进天气预报系统的鲁棒性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Conclusion: FIRE提供了一个统一的频域分解框架，为不同类型时间序列提供数学抽象，实现了可解释且鲁棒的时间序列预测。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

### [360] [SGM: A Statistical Godel Machine for Risk-Controlled Recursive Self-Modification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10232)
*Xuening Wu,Shenqin Yin,Yanlan Kang,Xinhang Zhang,Qianya Xu,Zeping Chen,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了统计哥德尔机(SGM)，这是第一个用于递归编辑的统计安全层，用统计置信度测试取代了基于证明的要求，在选定的置信水平下仅当确认优越性时才允许修改，同时分配全局错误预算来限制多轮累积风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归自修改在AutoML、神经架构搜索和自适应优化中越来越重要，但现有框架无法确保此类更改的安全性。哥德尔机通过要求在重写代码前提供形式化改进证明来提供原则性保障，但在随机高维环境中此类证明无法获得。

Method: 引入统计哥德尔机(SGM)，用统计置信度测试(e值、Hoeffding界)替代证明要求，仅当在选定置信水平下确认优越性时才允许修改。提出确认触发谐波支出(CTHS)，通过确认事件而非轮次来索引支出，将错误预算集中在有希望的编辑上，同时保持族有效性。

Result: 在监督学习、强化学习和黑盒优化的实验中验证了SGM的作用：在CIFAR-100上认证了真实增益，在ImageNet-100上拒绝了虚假改进，在RL和优化基准测试中展示了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些结果将SGM定位为学习系统中持续、风险感知自修改的基础设施。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PSCNet网络用于土壤湿度时空降尺度，结合ERA5-Land高时间分辨率数据，在青藏高原实现了10公里空间分辨率和3小时时间分辨率的无缝土壤湿度产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决土壤湿度时间尺度反演中因地表辅助因子不完整而受阻的问题，通过引入高时间分辨率ERA5-Land变量来改进低分辨率SMAP土壤湿度产品的降尺度过程。

Method: 设计了渐进尺度卷积网络(PSCNet)，包含多频率时间融合模块(MFTF)用于捕捉时间动态，以及定制化的压缩激励(SE)模块用于保留细粒度空间细节。

Result: 在青藏高原的实验中，PSCNet在卫星产品验证中表现出可比精度和更低误差(平均R值0.881)；在现场站点验证中R指标在所有站点均排名前三；时间泛化验证中所有方法R指标平均相对误差在6%以内。

Conclusion: PSCNet通过有效建模土壤湿度数据中复杂的时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了一个有前景的解决方案，展示了优秀的时间敏感性和生动的空间细节。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

Motivation: 现有分子性质预测方法存在可解释性差、跨任务泛化能力弱、缺乏化学推理能力等问题，需要开发既能准确预测又能提供化学见解的模型。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct构建多模态模型，整合分子图像和SMILES字符串；采用两阶段训练策略：使用16,000个高质量推理轨迹进行监督微调，然后通过基于原则的强化学习进行优化。

Conclusion: MPPReasoner通过结合多模态输入和化学推理，显著提升了分子性质预测的性能和可解释性，为化学家提供了有价值的分子分析见解。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their
decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车辆路径问题的深度学习模型通常在单一规模实例上训练和评估，这严重限制了它们在不同问题规模间的泛化能力，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 设计任务间正则化方案保留小规模问题的知识，任务内正则化方案模仿最新期望行为，并利用经验回放机制回顾已训练规模实例。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种问题规模（包括训练中未见过的规模）上均取得显著优于现有深度模型的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的持续学习框架有效提升了车辆路径问题模型的泛化能力，消融研究验证了各设计组件的协同效应。

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

*Nikolaus Salvatore,Hao Wang,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs在长文本中表现出"中间信息丢失"现象，这与人类记忆的首因效应和近因效应类似。研究发现这种现象不是简单的信息丢失缺陷，而是模型对预训练中不同信息检索需求的适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在长文本处理中表现出的位置偏差现象，特别是为什么重要信息在文本中间时模型性能会下降，以及这种现象与人类记忆机制的相似性。

Method: 使用GPT-2和Llama变体从头开始训练，在两个模拟人类长期和短期记忆需求的简单记忆范式上进行实验，并分析序列补全任务。

Result: 研究表明U形性能曲线确实出现，近因效应与训练数据中的短期记忆需求直接对应，而首因效应由均匀的长期记忆需求诱导，并受到自回归特性和注意力汇形成的影响。

Conclusion: 信息检索需求、模型架构和训练过程中的注意力动态共同导致了LLMs中观察到的位置偏差。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

TL;DR: VivaBench是一个多轮对话基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在临床推理中的表现，模拟医生在不确定性下进行迭代诊断的过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基准测试主要评估知识回忆能力，而真实的临床推理是一个假设驱动的多步骤过程，需要从有限信息中逐步获取和整合信息来做出诊断。

Method: 构建了1762个医生策划的临床案例，模拟医学培训中的口头考试场景，要求AI代理主动询问相关信息、选择适当检查，并在多步骤中整合信息以达成诊断。

Result: 当前LLM在完整描述的临床案例中表现良好，但在需要迭代诊断推理的不确定性环境下表现显著下降，出现了与临床实践中常见认知错误类似的失败模式。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医学AI系统提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前LLM在不确定性环境下推理和决策的基本局限性，对智能代理AI研究有重要贡献。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型代理在新环境中样本效率低的问题，特别是在交互成本高的场景中，如与人类交互或重置物理系统。

Method: 采用事后经验回放方法，包含两个组件：事后规则（识别相关子目标并生成优化轨迹）和更新规则（维护压缩的轨迹表示）。

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA基准测试中，ECHO比基础语言代理基线性能提升高达80%，在XMiniGrid中优于Reflexion和AWM等复杂架构。

Conclusion: ECHO通过更有效地利用过去经验，展示了在陌生环境中更快的适应能力，为语言模型代理提供了更高效的体验整合方法。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

Motivation: 传统GNN在稠密图（如点云、分子交互）上效率低，且通过稀疏化会丢失多尺度信息，需要一种能同时捕获局部和长程交互的方法。

Method: 使用图元组框架将图划分为不相交子图，采用异构消息传递架构（受非交换算子理论启发）学习多视图表示。

Result: 在分子性质预测和宇宙学参数推断两个应用上，多视图图元组模型性能优于单图基线。

Conclusion: 多视图方法在表达能力和性能上优于传统单图消息传递模型，具有更强的通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

Motivation: 抗抑郁药物不依从性普遍存在，导致复发、住院、自杀风险和数十亿美元的可避免成本。现有方法要么具有侵入性（血清检测、神经影像），要么基于代理且不准确（药片计数、药房续药）。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的模型分析来自消费者可穿戴设备或接触式无线传感器的睡眠数据，推断抗抑郁药物摄入情况，实现远程、无负担的日常依从性评估。

Result: 在包含62,000个夜晚、超过20,000名参与者（1,800名抗抑郁药物使用者）的六个数据集中，生物标志物实现了AUROC = 0.84，能够跨药物类别泛化，与剂量呈比例关系，并对伴随的精神药物保持稳健。纵向监测捕获了现实世界中的开始用药、减量和漏服情况。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了客观、可扩展的依从性监测，具有改善抑郁症护理和结果的潜力。

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

Method: 使用Hanson-Wright不等式强化次高斯方差集中性分析，识别严格次高斯分布类别；设计无探索的非自适应和自适应算法；将框架扩展到上下文赌博机设置。

Result: 建立了比现有结果更紧的遗憾界，提出了利用侧信息的可证明保证算法。

Conclusion: 无探索分配是多组均值估计的原则性和高效方法，在实验设计、个性化等需要准确多组推断的领域有应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

TL;DR: NMF-LAB是一种新的监督式非负矩阵分解方法，将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接从特征映射到标签概率，无需额外分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NMF是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签。现有监督方法通常通过惩罚项或图约束引入标签，但仍需要外部分类器。

Method: 将标签矩阵Y作为观测值，协变量A作为解释变量，进行非负矩阵三因子分解，直接获得从特征到标签的映射概率。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，NMF-LAB具有竞争力的预测精度、对噪声或不完整标签的鲁棒性、可扩展性，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: NMF-LAB通过将回归和分类统一在三因子NMF框架中，为现代分类任务提供了一种新颖、概率化且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

Conclusion: TreeDiff通过MCTS引导的双空间扩散框架，解决了现有图生成方法在可控性和质量稳定性方面的局限性，实现了高效且可扩展的可控图生成。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

Motivation: 理解Transformer如何通过上下文学习新概念，现有理论研究主要基于简化的线性自注意力和连续回归任务，而实际Transformer通常在离散复杂任务上训练，需要填补这一理论空白。

Method: 将现有理论扩展到分类任务设置，研究非线性（特别是softmax）激活下Transformer的学习算法，分析其在核特征空间中的梯度下降行为。

Result: 发现Transformer仍然在上下文学习中执行梯度下降，但softmax Transformer在核特征空间中进行梯度下降，并具有上下文自适应学习率，表现出更强的上下文适应能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究增强了在更现实设置下对上下文学习算法的理论理解，推动了我们对Transformer学习机制的理解，并为扩展到更大模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

TL;DR: HiLoMoE是一个分层LoRA MoE框架，通过参数高效的方式实现整体扩展，结合了垂直扩展和水平扩展的优势，在CTR预测任务中实现了更好的性能-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决CTR预测中垂直扩展（层堆叠）计算效率低，而水平扩展（MoE）难以捕捉推荐任务层次结构的问题，探索两种扩展方向的互补优势。

Method: 使用轻量级rank-1专家进行参数高效的水平扩展，堆叠多个具有分层路由的MoE层以实现组合多样的专家组合，基于前层评分而非输出进行路由以实现并行执行。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上，相比非MoE基线，平均AUC提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%，实现了更好的性能-效率权衡。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE通过分层LoRA MoE框架成功结合了垂直和水平扩展的优势，在参数高效的前提下实现了更好的CTR预测性能。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MTL-FSL的新型多任务学习框架，通过特征相似性拉普拉斯图来建模阿尔茨海默病数据中特征间的时间变化相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务学习框架未能考虑阿尔茨海默病纵向数据中特征相关性的时间变化特性，这限制了模型的预测准确性和生物学可解释性。

Method: 引入特征相似性拉普拉斯惩罚项来显式建模特征间的时间变化关系，同时考虑任务间的时序平滑性和特征间的动态相关性，使用ADMM算法解决非光滑优化问题。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验表明，MTL-FSL框架实现了最先进的性能，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的MTL-FSL框架通过建模特征间的时间变化相关性，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病预测的准确性和模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

TL;DR: 本文分析了反向监督策略的计算复杂性，指出即使有量子计算等大幅加速技术，机器学习仍然需要人类的初始监督输入来定义目标和提供种子标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在计算能力大幅提升的背景下，机器学习是否仍然需要人类的监督输入，以及生成式AI能否完全替代人类标注工作。

Method: 分析反向监督策略的计算复杂性，该策略在大型未标注数据集上搜索最小化小型标注数据集误差的标注方案，搜索空间为2^n的指数复杂度。

Result: 即使计算速度大幅提升（如量子计算），机器学习仍然需要人类提供目标定义、类别规范和种子标注等初始输入。生成式AI只能作为标签放大器，在人类监督下发挥作用。

Conclusion: 极端计算速度只能减少训练时间，但不能消除学习的基本监督需求。人类（或人类级别）的初始输入对于将系统锚定在预期任务中仍然是必要的。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Motivation: 动物运动模拟器对行为研究很重要，但真实世界转移模型未知，仅靠数学模型不足，需要构建既能重现真实轨迹又支持奖励优化的模拟器。

Conclusion: 该方法能够模拟和阐明复杂的多动物行为，具有在新型实验设置中进行反事实行为预测和灵活what-if轨迹生成的潜力。

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Motivation: 现有方法使用共享嵌入层处理所有通道，造成表示瓶颈，掩盖了有价值的通道特定信息。

Method: 引入共享-辅助嵌入(SAE)框架，将嵌入分解为捕获共同模式的共享基础组件和建模独特偏差的通道特定辅助组件，并利用低秩分解和共享门控组件池实现参数效率。

Result: 在9个IoT相关数据集和4个骨干架构上的广泛实验表明，LightSAE在仅增加4.0%参数的情况下，MSE改进高达22.8%。

Conclusion: LightSAE通过利用辅助组件的低秩和聚类特性，有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的表示瓶颈问题，实现了参数效率和高性能的平衡。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

TL;DR: AnyBCQ是一种硬件友好的多精度量化方法，通过二进制位平面表示权重，支持直接位平面操作和动态精度选择，在低比特（如2位）下显著减少精度损失，并实现高达3.0倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署面临内存和延迟瓶颈，需要灵活平衡精度和效率的量化技术。现有方法需要支持多精度推理以适配不同运行时约束。

Method: 基于二进制编码量化（BCQ）的扩展，将权重表示为带缩放因子的二进制位平面，支持位平面级计算和渐进精度扩展机制，重用已有二进制码并逐步优化缩放因子。

Conclusion: AnyBCQ通过算法灵活性与硬件效率的对齐，为多精度LLM部署提供了实用基础，能够适配多样化的服务级别目标。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于锚点的最大差异(AMD)方法，用于相对相似性测试，通过同时学习合适假设和核函数来解决现有方法中核选择与假设指定顺序的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于核的相对相似性测试方法在手动指定备择假设后选择核函数，这会导致总能找到使假设被拒绝的核，使测试定义不明确。

Method: 提出AMD方法，在深度核空间中定义相对相似性为(U,P)和(U,Q)距离的最大差异。测试分为两个阶段：第一阶段估计AMD并推断潜在假设，第二阶段评估假设的统计显著性。

Result: 通过理论验证和基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AMD方法通过同时学习假设和核函数，解决了相对相似性测试中核选择与假设指定的顺序问题，提供了一种统一的测试框架。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

Conclusion: RADiAnce成功桥接了基于检索的知识和生成式AI，为蛋白质结合剂设计建立了新范式，为药物发现开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种梯度增强自训练PINN方法(gST-PINN)，通过梯度伪点自学习算法解决传统PINNs精度低、训练慢、缺乏标签数据等问题，在多种PDE问题上表现优于标准PINN。


<details>

Motivation: 传统PINNs存在精度有限、训练动态缓慢、缺乏标签数据以及多物理场交互处理不足等挑战，需要改进方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出梯度增强自训练PINN(gST-PINN)方法，引入基于梯度的伪点自学习算法，是一种纯半监督方法，即使在PDE解不可用时也能有效工作。

Result: 在三种不同类型PDE问题上的测试表明，gST-PINN在Burgers方程上达到10^-3量级MSE，扩散-吸附方程达到10^-4量级MSE，且随着迭代持续改进至10^-5量级，明显优于标准PINN。

Conclusion: gST-PINN在缺乏标签数据的情况下仍能优于标准PINN方法，解决了低精度和收敛问题，推广了PINN和gPINN方法，适用于各种易出现精度和收敛问题的场景。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

Conclusion: f-influence提供了可靠的影响力估计方法，适用于数据清理和模型行为归因，解决了现有方法在训练随机性下的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时实现了高保真数据合成，为医疗AI应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

Result: 在Rotated MNIST和ADNI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在预测准确性和域选择效率方面显著优于传统CDA方法。

Conclusion: 该集成策略能同时优化转移路径和目标任务性能，有效提升域自适应过程的效果。

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Conclusion: 当前基准不足以评估泛化能力，提出了三个核心设计原则：足够难度、平衡评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的强化学习PAC-Bayesian泛化边界，通过考虑马尔可夫链的混合时间来显式处理数据中的序列依赖性，为现代离策略算法提供非平凡的泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中数据的序列性质打破了经典泛化边界所依赖的独立性假设，因此需要开发能够处理马尔可夫依赖性的泛化理论。

Method: 推导了考虑马尔可夫链混合时间的PAC-Bayesian泛化边界，并基于此开发了PB-SAC算法，在训练过程中优化该边界以指导探索。

Result: 在连续控制任务上的实验表明，该方法能够提供有意义的置信度证书，同时保持竞争力的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该工作为强化学习提供了首个能够处理序列依赖性的非平凡泛化保证，并展示了理论边界在实际算法设计中的实用价值。

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MFAM模型，通过频率分解模块和注意力多实例学习框架，提升帕金森病严重程度评估的准确性和特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用时间序列模型缺乏病理特异性，且帕金森病症状的时间稀疏性导致关键诊断特征容易被传统聚合方法稀释。

Method: 使用频率分解模块结合医学先验知识，引入注意力多实例学习框架自适应聚焦最有诊断价值的稀疏片段。

Result: 在公开PADS数据集和私有数据集上的实验表明，MFAM在处理复杂临床时间序列方面优于通用时间序列模型。

Conclusion: MFAM为帕金森病严重程度的自动化评估提供了一个有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary
material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究智能体如何通过对称性结构来有效跟踪和压缩感官输入流，探索组合性在深度模型中的几何基础。

Method: 将智能体建模为与感官流耦合的神经动力系统，分析对称性对智能体结构和动力学的约束，包括等变性和守恒量。

Result: 证明了准确的世界跟踪要求智能体方程具有等变性，并在静态输入下产生守恒量，在缓慢漂移下保持低维流形结构。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度模型的组合性提供了几何解释，并提出了基于对称性的预测编码版本，其中高层仅接收沿对称方向的粗粒度残差变换。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

Method: 提出FusionGen框架，基于解耦表示学习和特征融合，通过特征匹配融合模块整合跨试验特征，结合轻量级特征提取和重建流程。

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionGen显著优于现有的数据增强技术，在分类准确率上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: FusionGen通过确保数据多样性和在有限数据条件下的可训练性，有效解决了EEG数据稀缺和主体间变异性问题。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

Motivation: 构建学习模型通常需要评估大量中间模型，这些评估会影响后续模型探索决策。虽然先验知识可以提供初始质量估计，但真实性能只有在评估后才能揭示。

Method: 将中间模型探索问题形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的一般预算分配问题。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate

structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value

Conclusion: EDGAN在预测准确性和收敛稳定性方面持续优于传统GAN变体，为股票价格预测提供了有效的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Conclusion: SDG-L框架能够有效利用电池状态信息进行容量预测，为锂离子电池的耐久性评估提供了准确可靠的方法。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

TL;DR: ImpMIA是一种基于神经网络隐式偏置的白盒成员推理攻击方法，无需依赖参考模型，在现实场景中优于现有黑盒和白盒攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒成员推理攻击依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。这些假设在实际中很少成立，导致攻击性能显著下降。

Method: ImpMIA利用神经网络的最大间隔隐式偏置理论，通过KKT最优性条件识别训练样本。该方法寻找梯度最能重构训练模型参数的样本，无需训练参考模型。

Result: 在仅提供模型权重和训练数据超集的现实场景中，ImpMIA相比现有黑盒和白盒攻击方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ImpMIA通过利用神经网络的隐式偏置，消除了对参考模型和不现实假设的依赖，在现实成员推理攻击场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构表示方法面临SE(3)流形复杂性、离散标记化或需要多个训练目标等挑战，这些因素阻碍了模型优化和泛化能力。

Method: 使用非等变扩散变换器与瓶颈设计，通过单一流匹配目标进行端到端训练，直接将蛋白质主干坐标从E(3)映射到连续紧凑潜空间。

Result: ProteinAE实现了最先进的重建质量，优于现有自编码器。基于该潜空间的潜扩散模型能够高效生成高质量结构，与领先的结构方法竞争并显著优于先前的潜空间方法。

Conclusion: ProteinAE提供了一种简化的蛋白质结构表示学习框架，通过连续潜空间表示克服了现有方法的局限性，为蛋白质生成建模提供了强大基础。

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的集成采样算法框架，用于非线性上下文赌博机，包括GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种方法，分别针对广义线性模型和神经网络模型，并提供了相应的遗憾界分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非线性上下文赌博机中，随机化探索算法的理论保证有限，需要开发一个统一的框架来提供可证明的遗憾界。

Method: 通过最大似然估计在随机扰动数据上维护多个奖励模型参数估计器，开发了GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种集成采样方法。

Result: 证明了GLM-ES的遗憾界为O(d³/²√T + d⁹/²)，Neural-ES的遗憾界为O(˜d√T)，这些结果与最先进的随机化探索算法相匹配。

Conclusion: 集成采样是非线性上下文赌博机中一种可证明且实用的随机化探索方法，理论分析和实验验证都显示了其优越性能。

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

LLM responses through explicit diffusion terms and reveals systematic
interference patterns between competing objectives via an interference matrix
formulation. We validate our theoretical framework using iterative code

security, efficiency, and functionality objectives. Our results demonstrate
strategy-dependent convergence behaviors with rates ranging from 0.33 to 1.29,
and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work
proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM
interactions, with code generation serving as an initial validation domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)方法，通过渐进式深度扩展训练策略，为不同复杂度数据集寻找最优网络深度，减少模型大小和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常以全深度训练，但并非所有数据集都需要如此高的模型容量，导致计算浪费、能耗过高和内存占用过大，难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 采用类似NAS的训练策略——渐进式深度扩展，从较浅深度开始训练，随着早期模块收敛逐步增加深度，直到达到目标精度，仅使用数据集所需的最优深度。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别实现了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用减少，同时保持99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能有效平衡模型深度与任务复杂度，显著降低训练和推理成本，减少内存占用，提高计算效率，便于在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF微调扩散模型时训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题，从理论和实验上验证了高随机性SDE训练能缩小奖励差距并提升ODE推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在RLHF微调中存在训练时使用随机SDE采样器与推理时使用确定性ODE采样器的不匹配问题，这会导致奖励差距，影响推理时输出质量。

Method: 采用广义去噪扩散隐式模型(gDDIM)框架支持任意高随机性，保持数据边际分布，并通过DDPO和MixGRPO在文本到图像模型上进行大规模实验验证。

Result: 理论分析给出了奖励差距的非空边界和收敛速率，实验表明奖励差距随训练持续缩小，使用更高随机性的SDE训练能提升ODE采样质量。

Conclusion: 训练与推理采样器的不匹配确实会导致奖励差距，但通过高随机性SDE训练可以有效缩小这一差距并改善ODE推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Method: 使用基于注意力的多关系动态GNN，集成宏观经济背景的异构节点和边类型，通过行业节点作为全局中介实现快速冲击传播，结合GAT和Transformer捕获时空动态。

Result: 在公共数据集上优于现有股票预测模型，特别是在COVID-19期间表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OmniGNN通过创新的行业节点设计和多关系建模，有效提升了金融冲击期间的预测性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架，将最速下降法、拟牛顿法和自适应方法通过预条件矩阵范数概念进行泛化，揭示了SGD、Adam等优化器都是该框架的特例。基于此框架，提出了两种新方法MuAdam和MuAdam-SANIA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法面临在适应问题几何结构和利用曲率信息之间的权衡。最速下降法能适应不同几何但仅为一阶方法，而拟牛顿法和自适应方法能利用曲率信息但局限于Frobenius几何，限制了在不同架构中的适用性。

Method: 通过预条件矩阵范数的新概念，建立了一个统一框架。在该框架下，首次系统处理了矩阵参数化设置中的仿射和尺度不变性，并基于此提出了MuAdam和MuAdam-SANIA两种新方法，将Muon的光谱几何与Adam风格的预条件相结合。

Result: 实验表明，这些新优化器与现有最先进方法具有竞争力，在某些情况下甚至表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为理解各种优化器提供了新视角，新方法MuAdam和MuAdam-SANIA在实验中表现出色，为深度学习优化提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: BioOSS能有效模拟神经波状传播动态，为深度学习提供更生物启发的架构

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

Motivation: 解决在制度转换环境下传统投资组合分配方法对尾部风险建模不足的问题，改善危机时期的投资组合表现。

Method: 使用高斯HMM推断潜在制度，训练具有尾部加权目标和制度专业化MoE去噪器的扩散模型，然后将生成场景输入周转感知的CVaR二次规划分配器。

Result: 在2005-2025年回测中，MARCD获得夏普比率1.23（基准1.02），最大回撤9.3%（基准14.1%），夏普提升在5%水平显著。

Conclusion: MARCD提供了一个从尾部忠实场景建模到治理投资组合决策的可复现桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

Conclusion: AEGIS框架能够高效识别最优掩码配置，在保护隐私的同时保持数据效用，适用于原始数据不可访问的场景。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-GNN融合策略对所有节点统一应用，整体性能提升有限。作者认为这是因为聚合指标掩盖了LLM的实际价值，需要针对GNN容易失败的节点进行针对性融合。

Method: 提出GLANCE框架：1）识别GNN和LLM在不同结构模式（如局部同质性）上的性能差异；2）使用轻量级路由器基于节点信号决定是否查询LLM；3）通过优势目标训练路由器，比较使用LLM与仅用GNN的效用。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GLANCE在节点子组间实现最佳性能平衡，在异构节点上性能提升高达13%，同时达到整体性能最优。

Conclusion: 自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构具有重要价值，选择性调用LLM可以在大规模图上实现可扩展部署，避免高昂计算成本。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合学习方法来训练缓存替换和预取策略，通过开发共享特征表示来解决这两个策略之间的双向依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习策略虽然在单独训练时表现良好，但当它们一起部署时可能无法达到最优性能。缓存替换和预取策略之间存在双向依赖关系，需要联合训练。

Method: 提出了两种开发共享特征表示的方法：基于联合编码器的方法和基于对比学习的嵌入方法。

Result: 两种方法都展示了有希望的初步结果。

Conclusion: 为未来在这个方向的研究制定了议程，强调了联合训练缓存策略的重要性。

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Conclusion: 图异配性程度与GNN性能之间的关系不是简单的单调相关，需要自适应滤波器设计来保证良好的泛化性能，提出的自适应混合方法有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度唯一性的隐私泄露度量方法，用于评估发布机器学习模型时的隐私风险，该方法无需假设模型架构、数据类型或攻击策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发布机器学习模型时存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种原则性的方法来量化这种风险，并证明发布模型比发布数据集风险更小。

Method: 推导出梯度唯一性这一隐私泄露度量指标，它基于发布学习模型时信息泄露的上界。该方法不依赖特定假设，具有通用性。

Result: 基于梯度唯一性监控的简单防御方法在隐私保护方面与DP-SGD相当，但在测试准确率（效用）方面显著更好。

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性提供了一种直观的隐私审计方法，能够在保持良好模型效用的同时实现有效的隐私保护。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Motivation: 现有基于VAE的时间序列异常检测方法存在单窗口特征限制和长期时频信息利用不足的问题，需要改进以提升检测性能。

Method: 提出LPCVAE模型，结合LSTM捕获长期时间依赖，使用Product-of-Experts机制进行概率时频融合，实现自适应分布级融合。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，验证了长期时频表示与自适应融合的有效性。

Conclusion: 集成长期时间和频率表示与自适应融合为时间序列异常检测提供了鲁棒高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Motivation: 现有研究表明，更强的模型并不总是最优的教师，存在教师输出与学生可学习性不匹配的问题。

Method: 采用"路由后生成"范式：首先通过查询级路由器为每个提示分配最优教师，考虑学生可学习性和教师响应质量；然后各教师仅为分配的提示生成数据，比传统的"生成后选择"更高效。

Conclusion: PerSyn验证了其有效性，并为未来研究提供了额外见解，展示了个性化数据合成在知识蒸馏中的潜力。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架，将经典信息论扩展到有限结构化系统，重新定义冗余为信息组织的基本属性而非低效性。该框架将冗余表达为一族信息散度，统一了互信息、卡方依赖和谱冗余等经典度量，揭示了它们共享的冗余几何结构。理论预测冗余存在上下界，产生平衡过压缩和过耦合的最优均衡点。实验表明在掩码自编码器中，该均衡点对应最佳泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通信理论将冗余视为需要最小化的低效性，但现实世界中的有限结构化系统（如机器学习）实际上需要一定程度的冗余来实现稳定性和泛化能力。作者旨在建立连接通信理论和学习理论的统一框架，重新认识冗余的作用。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架，将冗余重新定义为信息组织的基本属性，表达为一族信息散度。该框架统一了多种经典信息度量，揭示了它们共享的几何结构。通过理论分析预测冗余的上下界和最优均衡点，并使用掩码自编码器进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明冗余存在上下界，产生最优均衡点。实验结果显示，在掩码自编码器中，当冗余水平接近该均衡点时，模型的泛化性能达到峰值，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 冗余是一个可测量和可调节的量，它连接了通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界。在有限结构化系统中，适度的冗余对于实现稳定性和泛化能力至关重要，这与传统通信理论中最小化冗余的观点形成对比。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

<details>

Motivation: RLVR训练中常出现策略熵崩溃问题，导致策略过于确定性，阻碍探索并限制推理性能。传统的固定系数熵正则化方法效果不稳定，需要更智能的调节机制。

Method: 提出自适应熵正则化(AER)框架，包含三个组件：难度感知系数分配、初始锚定目标熵和动态全局系数调整，动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER始终优于基线方法，显著提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: 自适应熵正则化能够有效解决RLVR训练中的策略熵崩溃问题，为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了更稳定和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

Motivation: 解决MoE模型中预加载所有专家和激活多个专家带来的显著计算和内存开销问题，专家模块成为模型大小和推理成本的主要贡献者。

Method: 提出PMQ（预加载混合精度量化）通过线性规划优化位分配，平衡专家重要性和量化误差；OTP（在线Top-any剪枝）使用Gumbel-Softmax采样动态选择专家子集。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2上实现6.2倍权重压缩，平均2.57位，五个多模态基准上仅1.7%准确率下降；OTP减少20%以上专家激活，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: MC#通过结合PMQ的静态位宽优化和OTP的动态路由，实现了极端压缩且精度损失最小，展示了高效部署MoE模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our
code is available at https://github.com/BIRlz/APLOT

Motivation: 研究推理模型的内存优化策略，发现4位量化的通用方案在推理模型中失效，因为KV缓存而非模型大小可能主导内存使用

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行1700个推理场景的系统实验，分析不同规模模型的KV缓存与模型权重的内存分配权衡

Result: 发现8位4B参数是规模阈值：低于此规模的模型通过分配更多内存给权重获得更好精度，而更大模型通过分配内存给更长生成获得更好精度

Conclusion: 推理模型的内存优化不能与规模无关，小模型应优先模型容量，大模型应最大化推理时计算资源，这与非推理模型的优化策略根本不同

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出非可转移示例(NEs)，一种无需训练、数据无关的输入侧使用控制机制，通过模型特定的低敏感子空间重新编码输入，保持授权模型性能同时降低未授权模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么扰动数据使其不可学习，要么重新训练模型抑制迁移，但都无法控制未知模型的推理，且通常需要控制训练过程。需要一种能平衡数据效用与保护的方法。

Method: 在模型特定的低敏感子空间内重新编码输入，保持授权模型的输出，同时通过子空间错配降低未授权模型的性能。利用Hoffman-Wielandt不等式将性能下降与谱差异联系起来。

Result: 经验证明NEs在多样化视觉骨干网络和最先进的视觉语言模型上保持性能，而非目标模型即使尝试重建也会性能崩溃。

Conclusion: NEs是一种实用的方法，既能保持预期数据效用，又能防止未经授权的利用。

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

Motivation: 现有用户表示建模方法在跨领域泛化性和对噪声行为信号的敏感性方面存在不足，需要开发更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习框架。

Method: 提出多编码器架构处理异构数据，引入对比-自回归训练框架，结合自回归学习捕获语言空间领域知识和对比学习对齐用户-文本嵌入，使用UserQA数据集连接语言和表示空间。

Conclusion: 指令感知用户建模可以有效地在特定场景中实现用户信息的指令引导去噪，为更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

Conclusion: TAG是一种通用解决方案，能有效解决扩散模型中的离流形问题，提高生成样本的保真度和质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Motivation: 光电容积脉搏波(PPG)在可穿戴健康监测中广泛应用，但其可靠性常受噪声和运动伪影影响，限制了心率估计等下游应用。

Method: 提出DPNet作为基于Mamba的去噪骨干网络，结合尺度不变信噪比(SI-SDR)损失和辅助心率预测器(HRP)，通过心率监督提供生理一致性。

Result: 在BIDMC数据集上的实验表明，该方法对合成噪声和真实运动伪影具有强鲁棒性，能有效恢复PPG信号并保持心率准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在可穿戴医疗系统中实际部署的潜力，SI-SDR损失和心率引导监督发挥了互补作用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Conclusion: TED为边缘设备提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，在真实世界边缘应用中具有可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明CDRL4AD在准确性和根因分析方面优于最先进方法

Conclusion: CDRL4AD能够有效检测异常并识别因果关系，帮助人类专家诊断异常的根本原因

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

Result: PhysioME在各种模态缺失场景下实现了高一致性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: PhysioME有望成为现实临床决策中处理不完整数据的可靠工具。

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

Conclusion: RFTHGS超越了领先的神经组合基线、基于提示的方法以及GPT-4o等商业LLM，展示了专用小型LLM的潜力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

Conclusion: 该方法通过双向知识蒸馏有效解决了RGB和热成像数据间的模态差异问题，实现了稳健且深刻的知识转移，为热成像面部关键点检测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Result: LSTM获得最佳性能(F1:0.688)，在81%数据集上排名前二；Informer提供竞争性精度(F1:0.683)且训练快30%；传统方法在简单数据上成本低60%但真实场景F1差2-3倍。

Conclusion: 预测质量主导检测性能，建议复杂模式用LSTM，效率关键部署用Informer，资源受限简单周期数据用传统方法，为未来研究建立基线。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型进行极大多标签分类模型的纯低精度训练，通过Kahan求和和随机舍入实现全Float8训练，显著降低GPU内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XMC方法主要依赖FP16-FP32混合精度训练，存在不稳定、内存使用效率低和计算开销大的问题，而现有低精度方法通常为分类层保留更高精度。

Method: 使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型，结合Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，实现XMC模型的纯低精度训练，无需单精度主权重或张量缩放，并采用梯度融合和分块等内存优化。

Result: 成功训练了300万标签的XMC模型，仅使用6.6 GiB GPU内存，相比优化SOTA方法Renee所需的39.7 GiB大幅减少，且不损失准确率。

Conclusion: ELMO框架证明了XMC模型可以有效地在纯低精度下训练，显著降低了内存需求，为大规模标签分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGer是一种基于模型不确定性的训练无关生成方法，通过token-wise熵分布来减少冗余计算并提升性能，在复杂推理任务中实现最佳效率-性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理语言模型和测试时扩展方法需要为每个提示生成多个候选序列，但不同提示的复杂度不同，计算需求也应不同。当前方法为所有提示分配相同计算预算，存在冗余计算。

Method: 利用token-wise熵分布来识别高不确定性token，仅在这些情况下分支到多个推理路径，并将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer无需访问目标标签即可重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面达到最佳效率-性能权衡。当可访问目标标签时，相比Full Parallel Sampling减少65%的token生成（节省计算），Pass@k提升37%。

Conclusion: EAGer通过基于模型不确定性的自适应计算分配，有效减少了冗余计算，同时提升了推理性能，为复杂推理任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索工具增强强化学习在多样化领域中的泛化能力，尽管训练仅限于数学问题解决任务，但研究其能否有效迁移到其他复杂推理领域。

Method: 提出TGRL框架，包含：标准化的工具接口、双组件奖励系统（激励工具效率和推理抽象）、XML提示模板（分离思考、工具调用和响应）。

Result: 实验表明，基于数学任务学习的RL工具使用可以有效地迁移到其他领域的复杂任务，实现了出色的任务性能和高效的token使用。

Conclusion: 验证了工具强化学习在大语言模型推理中的跨领域潜力，实现了最先进的性能，展示了领域无关学习的可行性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释性的检测对齐(DA)方法，用于评估漏洞检测模型是否真正关注到漏洞代码行，而不是被数据中的虚假相关性和偏见所影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习漏洞检测模型只能标记整个函数为易受攻击，无法精确定位具体漏洞代码行。检测粒度对软件开发中调试和修复漏洞至关重要。

Method: 提出检测对齐(DA)方法，通过量化模型预测最影响的输入代码行与真实漏洞位置之间的一致性来评估模型。该方法与模型无关，可适应不同检测任务。

Result: 分析多个基于学习的漏洞检测器和数据集，发现这些模型的预测持续受到非漏洞代码行的偏见影响，凸显了偏见和虚假相关性的严重影响。

Conclusion: 当前漏洞检测模型存在严重的偏见问题，检测对齐方法能有效评估模型是否真正关注漏洞语义，为改进模型提供了重要指导。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Applied to Sea Surface Temperature data, it outperforms standard parallel

cross-layers coupling in improving predictive accuracy. Finally, we show that
the optimal network dynamics in each layer become increasingly linear,
revealing the slow modes propagated to subsequent layers.

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,
dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural
Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

Motivation: 语言模型权重的有效存储和传输变得越来越重要，但当前对这类数据模态的理解有限，压缩算法设计主要依赖手动试错方法。

Method: 基于自编码器的神经编解码器，包含三个关键技术：列向张量分块和归一化、重要性感知训练损失、基于模型输出的推理时误差补偿机制。

Result: 在开源语言模型上的实验表明，NWC在精度-压缩权衡方面达到竞争性或最先进的水平，在4-6位精度下表现尤为突出，精度几乎与FP16模型相当。

Conclusion: NWC框架为语言模型权重压缩提供了一种有效的学习压缩方法，在保持模型性能的同时实现了高效的压缩效果。

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

Conclusion: SCGL为从信号数据学习连接图提供了一个有效且计算高效的解决方案，在拓扑和几何恢复方面表现优异。

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高质量的节点嵌入，在计算效率和分类性能之间取得了良好平衡，特别适用于缺乏节点特征信息的图数据。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Conclusion: 该方法在异构数据场景下有效提升了全局模型的泛化能力和本地模型的个性化适配，实现了全局和局部层面的协同优化。

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

TL;DR: ENIGMA是一种新颖的LLM训练方法，通过将组织政策视为信息流形上的方向来联合改进推理、对齐和鲁棒性。该方法结合了GRPO、SAMI风格辅助损失和Sinkhorn正则化，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a

TL;DR: ST-Vision-LLM是一个将时空预测重构为视觉-语言融合问题的新框架，通过视觉LLM编码器处理历史流量矩阵，使用高效数值编码方案，结合监督微调和强化学习优化，在移动流量预测中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

### [458] [LouisKV: Efficient KV Cache Retrieval for Long Input-Output Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11292)
*Wenbo Wu,Qingyi Si,Xiurui Pan,Ye Wang,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LouisKV是一个高效的KV缓存检索框架，通过语义感知检索策略和细粒度管理方案，在长序列场景中显著提升性能，同时保持近乎无损的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存方法在长序列场景中存在显著的内存开销，且由于逐令牌检索和粗粒度页面级管理，在长输出推理场景中效率和准确性存在瓶颈。

Method: 基于关键KV具有强时间局部性和在输入提示与生成输出中呈现不同分布模式的观察，LouisKV引入语义感知检索策略（仅在语义边界触发检索）和解耦细粒度管理方案（为输入和输出序列定制差异化策略），并包含内核级优化（自定义Triton和CUDA内核）。

Result: 评估显示，LouisKV相比最先进的KV检索方法实现了高达4.7倍的加速，同时在各种长序列任务中保持近乎无损的准确性。

Conclusion: LouisKV通过利用时间局部性和语义边界，结合细粒度管理和内核优化，有效解决了长序列场景中KV缓存的内存和效率问题。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

TL;DR: DiffTSST是一个基于扩散模型的时序数据风格迁移框架，通过卷积编码器分离时序数据的内容和风格表示，并使用自监督注意力扩散过程进行重组，实现有效的风格迁移和数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉和语言领域风格迁移方法已很成熟，但时序数据的风格迁移方法仍然有限。时序风格迁移在数据增强和场景模拟等应用中很重要，能帮助机器学习模型在数据稀缺领域泛化。

Method: 使用卷积编码器分离时序数据的内容和风格表示，通过自监督注意力扩散过程进行重组。在推理时，从两个不同的时序序列中提取内容和风格，实现条件生成以完成风格迁移。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明DiffTSST实现了有效的风格迁移。在数据稀缺情况下，使用DiffTSST进行数据增强能提高异常检测性能。

Conclusion: DiffTSST框架成功实现了时序数据的风格迁移，并在实际应用中展示了其在数据增强方面的实用价值，特别是在数据稀缺情况下提升异常检测能力。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

TL;DR: EVP是一个事件感知的动态图提示学习框架，可作为现有方法的插件，通过利用历史事件知识来增强动态图学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图学习方法主要关注节点与时间的关系，但忽视了历史事件的影响。

Method: 1) 为每个节点提取历史事件序列，通过事件适应机制对齐事件特征与下游任务；2) 提出事件聚合机制将历史知识整合到节点表示中。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上进行了广泛实验来评估和分析EVP。

Conclusion: EVP框架能有效增强现有动态图学习方法对历史事件知识的利用能力。

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

TL;DR: ROLL Flash是一个支持异步强化学习后训练的系统，通过细粒度并行化和rollout-train解耦设计，显著提高了资源利用率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的同步强化学习后训练系统存在资源利用率低和可扩展性有限的问题，需要更高效的训练架构。

Method: 基于细粒度并行化和rollout-train解耦两个核心设计原则，提供灵活的编程接口，支持完全异步训练架构和高效的rollout机制。

Result: 在相同GPU预算下，ROLL Flash在RLVR任务上实现2.24倍加速，在智能体任务上实现2.72倍加速，异步训练性能与同步训练相当。

Conclusion: ROLL Flash通过异步训练架构显著提升了强化学习后训练的效率，为大规模语言模型的强化学习训练提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出多视图特征传播(MFP)框架，通过将特征划分为多个高斯噪声视图进行独立传播，在特征稀疏情况下提升节点分类性能并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在真实场景中面临的特征稀疏和隐私风险问题，传统方法在特征不完整或敏感时性能下降且易导致数据泄露。

Method: 扩展传统特征传播方法，将可用特征划分为多个高斯噪声视图，每个视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，最后聚合得到鲁棒的节点嵌入表示。

Result: 在多个图数据集上的实验表明，MFP在节点分类任务上优于现有基准方法，同时显著减少隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: MFP为特征缺失或敏感的图学习领域提供了有效且隐私保护的框架，传播输出作为替代插补而非原始特征重建，在保持效用的同时保护隐私。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次理论分析了批量大小对Adam优化器泛化性能的影响，发现在过参数化CNN中，小批量Adam可以取得接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本会收敛到较差的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要分析全批量Adam，但实际使用的是随机版本，两者收敛行为存在根本差异。需要理解批量大小如何影响Adam的泛化性能。

Method: 理论分析两层层过参数化CNN在图像数据上的表现，比较Adam和AdamW在不同批量大小下的行为，并通过大量实验验证理论发现。

Result: 小批量Adam和AdamW可以取得接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本收敛到较差的解。Adam的有效权重衰减界严格小于AdamW，解释了为什么Adam需要更敏感的λ调参。

Conclusion: 批量大小和权重衰减在Adam的泛化性能中起关键作用，小批量训练可以显著改善Adam的泛化能力。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在医学领域中的知识表示和处理机制，为医学任务的微调、去偏等技术提供指导。

Method: 使用四种可解释性技术：(1) UMAP投影中间激活值，(2) 基于梯度的权重显著性分析，(3) 层切除/移除，(4) 激活修补。

Result: 发现医学知识主要在模型前半层处理；年龄编码非线性且不连续；疾病进展表示非单调且循环；药物按医学专科而非作用机制聚类；某些模型中间层激活崩溃但最终层恢复。

Conclusion: 这些结果可为医学任务的LLMs微调、去学习和去偏提供指导，建议在特定模型层应用这些技术。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架和迭代摊销推理方法为通用任务适应提供了可扩展和可扩展的基础，弥合了基于优化的元学习与LLM等模型中的前向传递摊销之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

Conclusion: 这是首次将可微分Top-K算子引入推荐系统，并首次实现理论最优的线性时间复杂度Top-K选择。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

Result: 即使将重缩放器宽度减少8倍，通过最小增量重训练仍能保持完整精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的嵌入式系统实现了更节能、成本效益更高的AI推理。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

### [470] [How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11495)
*Nikolaos Tsilivis,Eran Malach,Karen Ullrich,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架来解释为什么在推理任务中，强化学习训练比单纯的下一个词预测训练更有效，特别是在处理包含长短思维链序列的混合分布时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在推理领域的最新进展主要依赖于先用下一个词预测训练大语言模型，再用强化学习优化的训练方法。本文旨在从理论上解释这种训练范式成功的原因。

Method: 通过研究从包含长短思维链序列的混合分布中学习，特别关注预测d位比特奇偶性的任务。在简化设置下，理论上证明自回归线性模型通过这种训练方法可以有效学习。

Result: 当长序列在数据中很稀少时，强化学习训练使自回归变换器能够泛化，而单纯的下一个词预测需要极端的统计或计算资源才能实现。只要长演示的比例不是指数级小，模型就能高效学习。

Conclusion: 强化学习通过利用增加的测试时间计算（表现为更长的响应）来促进学习过程，这一现象在多个设置中得到了验证，包括在Llama系列模型上的后训练实验。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

*Yuhang Li,Chenchen Zhang,Ruilin Lv,Ao Liu,Ken Deng,Yuanxing Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Wiggin Zhou,Bo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLook是一个基于视觉的强化学习框架，通过多模态大语言模型作为工具，实现前端代码的生成-诊断-优化循环，显著提升前端开发能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算法代码生成方面表现出色，但在前端开发中表现不佳，因为前端代码的正确性需要通过渲染像素和交互来判断。

Method: 采用代理式、视觉基础的强化学习框架，利用多模态LLM作为视觉批评者和反馈来源，引入强制优化规则确保单调改进，并在推理时解耦批评者以降低延迟。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook在基于视觉的前端代码生成方面持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: ReLook展示了代理感知、视觉奖励和训练-推理解耦在前端代码生成中的显著优势。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了生成轨迹策略(GTPs)，通过统一视角将扩散、流匹配和一致性模型视为ODE控制下的连续时间生成轨迹，克服了现有生成模型在离线强化学习中速度与性能的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在离线强化学习中面临速度与性能的权衡：扩散策略计算昂贵但性能好，一致性策略快速但性能较差。需要一种方法能够同时兼顾速度和性能。

Method: 提出生成轨迹策略(GTPs)，将现代生成模型统一视为学习ODE控制的连续时间生成轨迹，学习底层ODE的整个解映射，并引入两个理论上有原则的适配方法。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于之前的生成策略，在几个著名的困难AntMaze任务上实现了完美分数。

Conclusion: GTPs通过统一的ODE视角成功桥接了生成模型在离线强化学习中的速度与性能差距，提供了一种更通用的策略范式。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型中的错误推理模式，因为某些应用需要模拟学生的错误，用于课堂实时反馈或教师培训。

Method: 利用错误答案与潜在误解之间的循环一致性构建合成错误示例，并用这些数据训练学生模拟、误解分类和答案生成模型。

Result: 在三个教育任务中，MISTAKE方法在基于特定误解模拟错误学生答案、从观察到的错误答案推断潜在误解以及生成错误答案方面表现更优。

Conclusion: MISTAKE方法能有效模拟学生错误推理模式，在教育应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究结合基于树的机器学习方法和知识引导特征工程，利用多光谱遥感数据和气象数据，在中西部地区实现了高精度的蒸散发估算，并生成了500米空间分辨率的日尺度蒸散发数据产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蒸散发在陆地-大气相互作用中至关重要，但现有现场测量方法（如涡度协方差）只能获取单点数据，无法满足农业应用中对大范围区域蒸散发的估算需求。

Method: 比较了四种基于树的模型（随机森林、CatBoost、XGBoost、LightGBM）和简单前馈神经网络，结合知识引导的机器学习特征工程，使用5折交叉验证和站点-年份分层分割来避免数据泄露。

Result: LightGBM模型结合知识引导特征表现最佳，R²=0.86，MSE=14.99 W m⁻²，MAE=8.82 W m⁻²。特征重要性分析显示知识引导特征对预测蒸散发最为重要。

Conclusion: 成功开发了2019-2024年期间500米空间分辨率的日尺度蒸散发数据产品，与州级气象站估算结果相比具有最佳的一致性。

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图表示学习的多跳问题检索框架，通过多信息级别知识图谱和查询特定图神经网络来解决多跳RAG系统中的语义理解不足和噪声干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问题需要识别多个知识目标来合成答案，现有RAG方法难以充分理解复杂语义结构的问题，且在检索多个信息目标时容易受到无关噪声的影响。

Method: 首先构建多信息级别知识图谱(Multi-L KG)来建模不同信息级别，然后设计查询特定图神经网络(QSGNN)，采用层内/层间消息传递机制，在每次消息传递中由查询引导信息聚合，并提出了两种合成数据生成策略来预训练QSGNN。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在多跳场景下有效，特别是在高跳问题上改进可达33.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的图表示学习框架能够有效解决多跳问题检索中的挑战，通过多粒度信息聚合和噪声抑制显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于扩散模型的决策聚焦学习方法，通过扩散模型表示不确定参数分布，在随机优化中使用扩散模型样本优化决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策聚焦学习方法通常依赖确定性点预测，无法充分捕捉现实环境的随机性，需要更好的不确定性建模方法。

Method: 采用扩散模型表示参数分布，通过重参数化技巧实现端到端训练；并提出轻量级得分函数估计器，避免反向传播通过采样过程。

Result: 实验表明，扩散DFL方法在决策质量上持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为决策聚焦学习提供了有效的不确定性建模框架，提出的轻量级训练方法在保持性能的同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

Motivation: 传统统计套利方法未能联合优化因子识别和交易策略，导致在考虑交易成本时盈利能力下降。

Method: 使用注意力因子作为条件潜在因子，从公司特征嵌入中学习复杂交互，通过序列模型从因子残差组合中识别时间序列信号，联合估计因子和交易策略。

Result: 在24年期间对美国最大股票的回测显示，注意力因子模型获得超过4的样本外夏普比率，考虑交易成本后达到前所未有的2.3夏普比率。

Conclusion: 联合优化因子和交易策略对最大化交易成本后的盈利能力至关重要，弱因子在套利交易中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前强化学习微调方法在数学推理上主要是在强化现有解题模式而非发现新方法，为此提出了MATH-B基准测试来挑战现有模型，推动探索性强化学习方法的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在数学推理任务上只是优化已有解题模式，未能真正实现探索和获取新技能的目标，需要更难的基准测试来推动方法创新。

Method: 构建MATH-B基准测试，专门设计来击败常见开源模型（最高8B参数），即使在大规模采样下也难以解决，问题来源于DAPO-Math-17K和DeepScaleR数据集。

Result: 现有的RL微调模型如Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B和DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview在MATH-B上表现很差，即使在pass@1024采样下也无法解决这些问题。

Conclusion: MATH-B基准测试能够有效暴露现有方法的局限性，有望推动探索驱动的强化学习方法发展，激发更深层次的推理能力。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

Motivation: 研究随机过程诱导的流是否能够产生直线流（点加速度为零），从而可以通过一阶方法精确积分，以设计更易积分的传输方法。

Method: 通过分析随机过程的动态测度传输，提出一个简洁的PDE条件来表征直线性，该条件平衡了条件加速度和加权协方差张量的散度。

Result: 完全刻画了仿射时间插值，并证明在确定性端点耦合下会产生直线流。还推导了约束流几何的必要条件。

Conclusion: 为设计更易积分的传输提供了广泛指导，特别是在确定性端点耦合条件下可以实现直线流。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩散大语言模型的强化学习中需要保留所有蒙特卡洛样本的前向计算图，导致内存开销大，限制了样本规模，影响似然估计精度。

Method: 提出边界引导策略优化(BGPO)，构建满足线性和等价性两个关键性质的特殊下界，实现跨样本的梯度累积和恒定内存使用。

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的算法设计，实现了更准确的似然近似和RL目标估计，提升了扩散大语言模型的强化学习性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

TL;DR: QeRL是一个量化增强的强化学习框架，通过结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，加速LLM的强化学习训练过程，同时减少内存开销，并利用量化噪声增强探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM强化学习训练资源密集、GPU内存需求大和训练时间长的问题，同时发现量化噪声可以增强策略探索能力。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和低秩适配(LoRA)，引入自适应量化噪声(AQN)机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声水平。

Result: 在rollout阶段实现1.5倍加速，首次在单张H100 80GB GPU上训练32B LLM，在数学基准测试中达到GSM8K 90.8%和MATH 500 77.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: QeRL是一个高效且有效的LLM强化学习训练框架，在性能和效率方面都优于16位LoRA和QLoRA，并匹配全参数微调的性能。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

*Edward Stevinson,Lucas Prieto,Melih Barsbey,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络中的高效信息编码机制，特别是叠加现象（网络用更少的维度表示更多特征），使得攻击者可以利用特征间的干扰来生成对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对抗性样本产生的根本原因，挑战了现有将其归因于决策边界不规则或对非鲁棒特征敏感的观点，转而从信息编码效率的角度解释对抗性漏洞。

Method: 通过精确控制叠加现象的合成设置进行研究，并在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT模型中进行验证，分析特征排列如何使对抗性扰动可预测。

Result: 证明了叠加现象足以产生对抗性漏洞，对抗性扰动利用了叠加特征间的干扰，攻击模式可以从特征排列中预测，解释了模型间攻击可迁移性和类特定漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞可能是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入的问题，这为理解对抗性攻击提供了新的机制性解释。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合摊销方法和粒子方法的采样技术，通过连接序列蒙特卡洛(SMC)和最大熵强化学习训练的神经序列采样器，改进了从非归一化密度函数定义分布中的采样效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从非归一化密度函数定义分布中采样的挑战，结合摊销方法和粒子方法的优势，提高采样效率和训练稳定性。

Method: 建立SMC与神经序列采样器之间的联系，使用学习到的采样策略和价值函数定义提议核和扭曲函数，引入离策略RL训练程序，结合历史样本与退火重要性采样权重。

Result: 在合成多模态目标(连续和离散空间)和丙氨酸二肽构象的玻尔兹曼分布上，相比摊销方法和蒙特卡洛方法，在逼近真实分布和训练稳定性方面都有改进。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效结合了摊销采样和粒子方法，通过RL训练和自适应技术，在复杂分布采样任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM如何在表示空间中"思考"，理解其推理机制是否超越了表层形式，建立形式化分析框架。

Method: 使用几何框架建模LLM推理为表示空间中的流动，通过自然演绎命题分离逻辑与语义，设计控制实验可视化推理流。

Result: 理论证明LLM推理对应表示空间中的平滑流动，逻辑语句作为流动速度的局部控制器，实验验证了理论框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究LLM推理现象提供了概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为的可解释性和形式分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了PULSE框架，用于更高效地评估人类与AI代理的交互，通过收集用户反馈、训练预测模型和结合人工评分与模型伪标签来评估代理设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试大多假设完全自动化，未能反映真实世界中人机协作的性质，需要更严谨的人类-代理交互评估方法。

Method: 开发PULSE评估框架，包含用户反馈收集、用户满意度预测模型训练、人工评分与模型伪标签结合的结果计算。在开源软件代理OpenHands上部署该框架，收集超过1.5万用户的真实使用数据。

Result: 通过案例研究分析了三种代理设计决策（LLM主干选择、规划策略、记忆机制）对开发者满意度的影响，发现真实世界结果与基准测试性能存在显著差异（如claude-sonnet-4与gpt-5的反相关性）。框架使置信区间比标准A/B测试减少40%。

Conclusion: 基准驱动评估存在局限性，PULSE框架为人类参与的LLM代理评估提供指导，并识别了改进代理设计的机会。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

Motivation: 研究具身AI中出现的神经症行为，这些行为虽然内部一致但与现实不匹配，可能影响AI系统的安全性和效率。

Method: 在网格导航栈中识别神经症模式，开发轻量级在线检测器和可重用的逃脱策略，使用遗传编程进行破坏性测试以最大化法律压力和神经症评分。

Result: 识别了多种神经症模式（如摇摆不定、计划混乱、固执循环等），并展示了即使在完全可见性下，习得的厌恶成本仍会导致持久的恐惧回避行为。

Conclusion: 局部修复不足以解决全局故障，需要通过破坏性测试暴露需要架构修订而非症状级修补的问题。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的地球观测驱动的空间表示主要编码物理和光谱模式，缺乏捕捉城市功能和社会经济维度的人类活动信息。

Method: 通过多模态对齐将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI文本表示对齐，在预训练的AE基础上进行轻量级语义增强。

Result: 在伦敦地区，AETHER相比AE基线在土地利用分类F1得分上相对提升7.2%，社会经济映射的KL散度相对减少23.6%。

Conclusion: 通过耦合地球观测与人类中心语义，AETHER推进了地理空间基础模型向整合物理形态和功能意义的通用城市表示发展。

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a
flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human
scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to

TL;DR: 研究发现，当LLMs拥有用户记忆时，会对不同社会背景的用户产生系统性情感理解偏差，优势群体获得更准确的情感解读，这可能导致AI个性化系统强化社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，理解这种记忆如何影响情感推理变得至关重要，特别是AI如何基于用户背景差异解读相同情境下的情绪。

Method: 在15个大型语言模型上评估人类验证的情感智力测试，使用相同的情绪场景搭配不同的用户档案，分析模型的情感解读差异。

Result: 发现相同场景搭配不同用户档案会产生系统性不同的情感解读，多个高性能LLMs出现系统性偏见，优势群体获得更准确的情感解读，且在情感理解和支持建议任务中表现出显著的人口统计因素差异。

Conclusion: 为个性化设计的AI系统可能会无意中强化社会不平等，这是记忆增强AI面临的关键挑战。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型存在严重的推理缺陷，包括产生幻觉和逻辑谬误分类准确性差，这源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法。

Method: 构建逐步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为原子程序步骤（简单二元问题），并增加最终验证步骤，让模型咨询相关谬误的关系知识图谱。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用路径，展示了低成本干预在提升模型推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感日常场景中的部署，理解其在复杂道德推理中的价值对齐至关重要。现有研究多关注单轮提示，但多轮对话中的价值动态尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用三个模型（GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Gemini 2.0 Flash）在1000个Reddit道德困境中进行辩论，采用同步和轮询两种格式测试顺序效应和判断修订。

Result: GPT表现出强惯性（0.6-3.1%修订率），Claude和Gemini更灵活（28-41%）。GPT强调个人自主权，Claude和Gemini优先考虑共情对话。辩论格式强烈影响模型行为，GPT和Gemini表现出高从众性。

Conclusion: 多轮交互中的道德推理受辩论格式和模型特定行为的强烈影响，表明社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构方式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can

*Enric Junque de Fortuny,Veronica Roberta Cappelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个框架来评估大语言模型是否具备真正的战略思维能力，通过解构信念、评估和选择来分析模型在非合作博弈中的行为表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在均衡策略或推理深度方面的表现，但缺乏对其真正战略思维能力（包括形成对其他智能体的信念、评估可能行动并基于信念做出选择）的系统性研究。

Method: 开发了一个框架，在静态完全信息博弈中解构信念、评估和选择三个要素，通过分析模型的显性选择和推理轨迹，并引入无上下文博弈来排除记忆模仿的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在目标推理深度上表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为；在无约束条件下会自我限制推理深度，并对人类和合成对手形成差异化推测，显示出元推理能力；在复杂度增加时，显性递归让位于内部生成的启发式选择规则。

Conclusion: 信念一致性、元推理和新启发式形成可以从语言建模目标中联合涌现，为研究人工智能体的战略认知提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Qinglin Zeng,Ningyuan Liu,Stephen Fan,Ziliang Chen,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM工作流优化范式，通过最小化期望失败质量来系统性地学习并重塑失败分布的几何结构，而不是简单地最大化标量分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM工作流优化方法存在信息坍塌问题，将丰富的多步骤执行轨迹简化为简单的成功/失败信号，无法建模工作流的失败分布。

Method: 提出CE-Graph框架，通过反例池近似失败分布，识别最密集区域作为重复失败模式，并通过提议-验证机制应用有针对性的图编辑来贪婪地减少失败质量。

Result: 在数学、代码和问答基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了比强基线更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统的可靠性不是来自避免失败，而是来自系统性地学习和重塑其失败分布的几何结构。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

### [499] [Belief Graphs with Reasoning Zones: Structure, Dynamics, and Epistemic Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10042)
*Saleh Nikooroo,Thomas Engel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个图论框架，将可信度（外部信任）与置信度（网络结构产生的内部价值）分离，通过收缩传播过程获得置信度，定义推理区域作为高置信度、结构平衡的子图，支持在全局矛盾下进行经典推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信念系统很少具有全局一致性，但局部推理通常有效。需要一种能够容忍矛盾、在结构支持的地方激活经典逻辑的推理基础。

Method: 使用有向、带符号、加权图表示信念，通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域，提供近线性程序构建区域图谱，引入冲击更新模拟信念变化。

Result: 在合成带符号图上进行实证测试，报告区域恢复、冲击下的稳定性以及运行时间。

Conclusion: 该框架为容忍矛盾的推理提供了原则性基础，在结构支持的地方精确激活经典逻辑。

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwarmSys是一个受群体智能启发的分布式多智能体推理框架，通过探索者、工作者和验证者三个角色的迭代交互实现协调，无需全局监督即可支持动态任务分配和自组织收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体框架通常依赖固定角色或集中控制，限制了长时程推理的可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 集成自适应智能体和事件配置文件、基于嵌入的概率匹配以及信息素启发的强化机制，支持动态任务分配和自组织收敛。

Result: 在符号推理、研究综合和科学编程任务中，SwarmSys始终优于基线方法，提高了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 群体启发的协调是扩展性、鲁棒性和自适应多智能体推理的有前景范式，协调扩展可能与模型扩展相媲美，以推进LLM智能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE是一个自监督预训练框架，通过学习同步感知和可转移的面部动态来生成说话面部视频。它结合了掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，使用三个提示令牌编码身份、语音运动和周围运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以从无标签的视听流中学习同步感知的面部动态，并且缺乏统一的接口来处理不同的下游任务。

Method: 采用掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，使用三个提示令牌（身份、语音运动、周围运动）来分解面部动态，通过对比学习将音频和视觉模态对齐到共享嵌入空间。

Result: 在四个需要不同能力的任务系列中取得了最先进的结果，包括视听流同步、面部表情和头部动作识别、视觉语音识别和视觉配音。

Conclusion: 同步感知、分解的自监督预训练方法在多个下游任务中表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: StepFly是一个端到端的自动化故障排除指南框架，通过三阶段工作流解决TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解析、数据密集型查询和执行并行化等挑战，在真实TSG上达到约94%的成功率，显著减少执行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模IT系统中的故障管理依赖故障排除指南(TSG)，但手动执行缓慢且易出错。现有LLM解决方案缺乏对TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解析、数据密集型查询和执行并行化等关键挑战的专业支持。

Method: StepFly采用三阶段工作流：1) TSG Mentor工具协助SRE改进TSG质量；2) 离线预处理使用LLM从非结构化TSG中提取结构化执行DAG并创建专用查询准备插件(QPPs)；3) 在线执行使用DAG引导的调度器-执行器框架，支持并行执行独立步骤。

Result: 在真实TSG和事件上的评估显示，StepFly在GPT-4.1上达到约94%的成功率，优于基线方法，同时减少了时间和token消耗。对于可并行化的TSG，执行时间减少了32.9%到70.4%。

Conclusion: StepFly通过其创新的三阶段工作流和DAG引导的执行框架，有效解决了TSG自动化中的关键挑战，显著提高了故障排除的效率和成功率。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

TL;DR: 提出了DixitWorld评估套件，包含DixitArena动态多智能体环境和DixitBench静态问答基准，用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态溯因推理能力，揭示了生成创造性和判别理解之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉语言模型多模态溯因推理能力的评估主要局限于静态、单智能体任务，需要更全面的评估框架来解构这一挑战。

Method: DixitWorld包含两个核心组件：DixitArena（动态多智能体环境，评估假设生成和选择）和DixitBench（静态QA基准，隔离听者任务）。

Result: 较小开源模型在创意讲故事方面表现更好，而较大专有模型在整体性能特别是听者角色上更优；DixitBench与DixitArena听者结果强相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理中存在生成创造性和判别理解之间的关键权衡，这是开发更平衡和有能力视觉语言智能体的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

TL;DR: CharCom是一个模块化、参数高效的框架，通过可组合的LoRA适配器实现角色一致的故事插图生成，无需重新训练基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保角色身份一致性在基于扩散的文本到图像生成中仍然是一个基本限制，特别是在不同提示下保持角色一致性。

Method: 基于冻结的扩散骨干网络，使用可组合的LoRA适配器，通过提示感知控制在推理时动态组合适配器，实现每个角色的高效定制。

Result: 在多场景叙事上的实验表明，CharCom显著提高了角色保真度、语义对齐和时间一致性，在拥挤场景中保持鲁棒性，并能以最小开销实现可扩展的多角色生成。

Conclusion: CharCom适合实际应用，如故事插图和动画制作，提供了一种高效的角色一致性生成解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

TL;DR: 提出PALU方法，通过性能感知的长度更新来优化大语言模型的推理过程，在减少输出长度的同时提高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有简洁推理方法依赖手工设计的启发式规则，难以在简洁性和性能之间取得平衡，且难以跨领域和模型规模适应。

Method: PALU将简洁推理建模为约束优化问题，使用拉格朗日优化转化为无约束问题，并通过三个近似简化更新规则：离策略评估性能、截断拉格朗日乘子、使用分位数驱动长度调整。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型上，PALU将输出长度减少65%，准确率提高15%，在五个基准测试中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，能够跨领域（逻辑、STEM、数学）和模型规模（1.5B、7B、14B）适应。

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

TL;DR: SAFER是一个两阶段风险控制框架，通过弃权感知采样和保形过滤来解决开放域问答中缺乏固定有限解空间的问题，提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在风险敏感应用中部署时，确保输出可信度至关重要。现有方法不切实际地假设所有实例的可接受答案都能通过有限采样获得，这在开放域问答场景中存在问题。

Method: 第一阶段：在保留校准集上使用Clopper-Pearson精确方法校准采样预算；第二阶段：应用保形风险控制方法确定统计有效的置信度阈值，过滤不可靠候选答案。

Result: SAFER能够控制正确答案被排除的风险，并与各种任务特定的准入标准和校准-测试分割比例兼容。

Conclusion: SAFER框架在开放域问答场景中提供了统计保证，具有鲁棒性和高数据效率。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为环境调谐的新训练范式，让LLM智能体直接从问题实例中学习复杂行为，无需依赖预先收集的专家轨迹，解决了SFT过拟合和RL冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂多轮工具使用任务中前景广阔，但高质量训练数据极度稀缺。SFT在合成数据上会导致过拟合，而标准RL存在冷启动问题和训练不稳定性。

Method: 环境调谐通过结构化课程、可操作的环境增强提供纠正反馈，以及细粒度进度奖励来确保稳定高效的探索。

Result: 仅使用BFCL基准的400个问题实例，该方法不仅实现了与强基线相当的分布内性能，还表现出优越的分布外泛化能力，克服了SFT方法的性能崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作实现了从基于静态轨迹的监督微调到动态、基于环境的探索的范式转变，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖粗略启发式，缺乏对引导位置和干预强度的原则性解释，需要更可靠的行为控制方法来确保LLM的可信生成。

Method: PIXEL从双视图（尾平均和结束标记）学习属性对齐子空间，通过约束几何目标选择干预强度，进行样本级正交残差校准，并使用轻量级位置扫描识别可注入位置。

Result: 在多种模型和评估范式下，PIXEL持续改善属性对齐，同时保持模型通用能力，为LLM可控生成提供了实用且原则性的方法。

Conclusion: PIXEL通过最小干预原则提供表示级保证，支持可靠对齐，为LLM的可控生成提供了实用且原则性的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出自适应双推理器(ADR)，通过快速思维和慢速思维两种推理模式的动态切换，在保持推理性能的同时显著降低计算成本和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长推理模型在推理过程中存在过度思考问题，导致计算成本增加和推理延迟上升，需要平衡推理性能与效率。

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 监督微调阶段构建混合推理数据集；2) 强化学习阶段使用熵引导混合策略优化(EHPO)，在高熵单元分支并采用难度感知惩罚来平衡快慢推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ADR在保持推理性能的同时，推理输出长度减少49.5%-59.3%，性能提升最高达6.1%。

Conclusion: ADR通过自适应双推理模式有效平衡了推理性能与效率，为长推理模型提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

*Zixuan Qin,Kunlin Lyu,Qingchen Yu,Yifan Sun,Zhaoxin Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs中存在超稀疏的关键神经元集合，破坏这些神经元会导致72B参数模型完全崩溃，困惑度增加20个数量级；这些关键神经元集中分布在模型外层，特别是MLP的down_proj组件中；性能退化呈现急剧的相变而非渐进下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类大脑中少数关键神经元对核心认知功能至关重要的神经科学研究启发，探究LLMs是否也存在类似的关键神经元子集。

Method: 提出基于扰动的关键神经元因果识别方法，系统定位LLMs中的关键神经元，并在不同模型架构和规模上进行全面实验。

Result: 发现LLMs确实包含超稀疏的关键神经元集合，破坏这些神经元会导致模型性能急剧下降（困惑度增加20个数量级），且这些神经元主要集中在外层MLP的down_proj组件中。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更鲁棒的模型架构和提高安全关键应用中的部署安全性提供了指导，揭示了LLMs的脆弱性和可解释性特征。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的两步插件方法，通过识别感知和推理导向的注意力头并调节其贡献，有效减少多模态大推理模型的幻觉问题，在多个模型和基准测试中平均提升5%，最高提升15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大推理模型在视觉语言推理方面进展迅速，但幻觉问题仍然是一个持续存在的失败模式，表现为错误的推理链和视觉内容误解。研究发现注意力头存在阶段性分工：浅层头主要负责感知，深层头转向符号推理，这揭示了幻觉的两个主要原因：感知偏差和推理漂移。

Method: 提出轻量级且可解释的两步插件：功能头识别和类条件重缩放。该方法定位感知导向和推理导向的注意力头，并在不重新训练的情况下调节它们的贡献。

Result: 在三个真实世界MLRM模型（Kimi-VL、Ocean-R1、R1-Onevision）、六个跨三个领域的基准测试和四个基线方法上的评估显示，该插件平均提升5%，最高提升15%，仅增加<1%的计算开销和9%的基线延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法完全模型无关，显著增强了现成MLRM的可靠性和可解释性，使其能够安全部署在高风险应用中。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决Airbnb客服操作的复杂性，提高大语言模型在客服场景中的理解和应用能力。

Method: 采用意图、上下文和行动(ICA)格式重构策略和工作流程，开发合成数据生成策略进行低成本模型微调。

Result: 内部实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型性能，在准确性和处理时间评估指标上都有改善。

Conclusion: 该方法为客服支持应用设定了新基准，具有成本效益且能有效改善客户支持质量。

Abstract: We propose a practical approach by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)
with a framework designed to navigate the complexities of Airbnb customer
support operations. In this paper, our methodology employs a novel reformatting
technique, the Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format, which transforms
policies and workflows into a structure more comprehensible to LLMs.
Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create
training data with minimal human intervention, enabling cost-effective
fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出"包容性创新红利"概念，证明为多样化、受限用例设计的医疗AI解决方案能在更广泛市场中获得更优经济回报，并开发了HAIIF评分框架来评估AI投资的包容性价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然医疗AI公平性的伦理论证已很充分，但包容性设计的经济和战略价值仍未得到充分探索。论文旨在揭示包容性创新如何创造超越合规要求的商业价值。

Method: 借鉴辅助技术发展为数十亿美元主流产业的案例，识别包容性创新驱动回报的四个机制，并开发了医疗AI包容性创新框架(HAIIF)评分系统。

Result: 研究发现包容性设计通过市场扩展、风险缓解、性能红利和竞争优势四个机制创造经济价值，HAIIF框架为组织提供了评估AI投资包容性潜力的实用工具。

Conclusion: 渐进投资包容性设计的组织能实现市场扩展和持续竞争优势，而将包容性视为成本的组织将面临网络效应和数据优势积累带来的复合劣势。

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

*Siddartha Devic,Charlotte Peale,Arwen Bradley,Sinead Williamson,Preetum Nakkiran,Aravind Gollakota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文发现推理追踪长度是大型推理模型中简单有效的置信度估计器，与口头化置信度等方法表现相当但互补，揭示了推理后训练从根本上改变了追踪长度与准确率的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM幻觉问题并提升其可靠部署，需要有效的置信度估计方法。

Method: 通过多模型、多数据集和多提示的综合实验，研究推理追踪长度作为置信度估计器的性能，并分析其机制。

Result: 追踪长度在置信度估计方面表现优异，即使调整了问题难度和GRPO引起的长度偏差等混杂因素后，效果仍然存在，高熵或"分叉"标记在机制中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 推理后训练增强了超越口头表达的不确定性量化，确立了追踪长度作为大型推理模型的实用置信度度量。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traj-CoA是一个用于患者轨迹建模的多智能体系统，通过链式智能体处理电子健康记录数据，使用共享记忆模块减少噪声并保留时间线，在肺癌风险预测任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型为患者轨迹建模提供了通用方法，但电子健康记录数据的长序列和噪声特性给时序推理带来了挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，包括一系列工作智能体按顺序处理EHR数据块，将关键事件提炼到共享长期记忆模块EHRMem中，最后由管理智能体综合所有信息进行预测。

Result: 在基于五年EHR数据的零样本一年期肺癌风险预测任务中，Traj-CoA在四类基线方法中表现最优，分析显示其具有临床对齐的时序推理能力。

Conclusion: Traj-CoA为复杂患者轨迹建模提供了一个强大且可推广的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的医疗AI系统在处理孤立任务时表现良好，但在整合临床工作流程中连接诊断推理和用药决策时存在困难，缺乏临床团队中的交叉验证和知识整合。

Method: 设计了一个置信度感知的多智能体框架MedCoAct，集成了专门的医生和药剂师智能体来模拟临床协作，并创建了DrugCareQA基准来评估医疗AI在整合诊断和治疗工作流程中的能力。

Result: MedCoAct实现了67.58%的诊断准确率和67.58%的用药推荐准确率，分别比单智能体框架提高了7.04%和7.08%。该协作方法在不同医疗领域都表现良好，特别适用于远程医疗咨询和常规临床场景。

Conclusion: 协作式多智能体方法能够有效提升医疗AI在整合诊断和治疗决策方面的性能，提供可解释的决策路径，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

TL;DR: 提出了Latent-Trajectory信号，通过分析模型内部表征在推理过程中的时间演化来预测推理路径的成功率，显著提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型通过增加计算资源来提升问题解决能力，但识别哪些推理路径可能成功是关键机会，可靠预测有效路径可以大幅减少浪费的计算并提高整体效率。

Method: 引入Latent-Trajectory信号，通过测量推理开始和结束时潜在表征的总体变化、中间步骤累积的变化以及这些变化向最终状态推进的程度来预测解决方案准确性。

Result: Latent-Trajectory信号比跨层度量和基于输出的置信度测量更可靠地预测解决方案准确性。在指导多个生成样本的答案选择时，相比多数投票，减少了高达70%的token使用量，同时平均准确率提高了2.6%。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为推理时效率提供了实用策略，还从可解释性角度深入理解了推理过程在潜在空间中的表示和区分方式。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

TL;DR: ARIA是一个基于规范驱动、人机协作的自动化可解释数据分析框架，通过自然语言规范定义分析目标，自动生成可执行代码并验证计算，实现透明文档化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据的快速增长导致分析能力与研究意图之间的差距扩大，现有AI分析工具要么偏向自动化而缺乏透明度，要么依赖手动脚本阻碍可扩展性和可重复性。

Method: ARIA采用六层互操作架构（命令、上下文、代码、数据、编排和AI模块），在文档中心化工作流中统一人类推理和机器执行，通过自然语言规范驱动分析过程。

Result: 在波士顿房价案例中，ARIA发现25个关键特征并确定XGBoost为最佳模型（R平方=0.93），过拟合最小。跨领域评估显示ARIA在性能、可解释性和效率方面优于现有系统。

Conclusion: ARIA通过将AI研究原则与科学原则结合在规范驱动架构中，为透明、协作和可重复的科学发现建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

TL;DR: ELAIPBench是一个由领域专家构建的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型对AI研究论文的理解能力，包含403个选择题，实验显示最佳LLM准确率仅39.95%，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM对学术论文深度理解方面存在不足，要么问题设计肤浅，要么评估指标不可靠，需要构建更有效的评估工具。

Method: 通过激励驱动的对抗性标注过程开发ELAIPBench基准，包含137篇论文的403个选择题，涵盖三个难度级别，强调非平凡推理而非浅层检索。

Result: 最佳LLM准确率仅39.95%，前沿LLM即使配备思维模式或RAG系统也无法改善结果，甚至因过度思考或噪声检索而降低准确率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真正理解学术论文之间存在显著差距，需要进一步研究提升模型对复杂学术内容的深度理解能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

Conclusion: AAS为实现从"经验时代"到"模拟时代"的转变提供了基础支撑，通过生成高质量模拟数据推动教育系统研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究已引入基于方法的推理和范围扩展来提升大语言模型性能，但缺乏系统整合。本文旨在将这些思想统一到一个框架中，更系统地解决间接（未见）问题。

Method: 构建直觉-方法分层模型：直觉层提供快速反应答案，方法层将问题解耦为可转移推理单元。引入四种范围扩展：垂直（因果分析）、水平（平行和泛化问题）、时间和空间扩展，并组织成系统知识树网络。

Result: 提出了方法扩展熵作为定量评估指标，衡量扩展的独立性和多样性，以此评估系统解决未见问题的能力。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑连接现有方法并引入新的扩展维度及基于熵的评估框架，这项工作推进了LLM在现实问题解决中更稳健和可扩展的推理范式。

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于累积Jaccard指数的随机置换集距离度量方法，该方法具有自然的上权重特性，能够克服现有方法的不足，并具有更高的敏感性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集是表示有序结构不确定信息的新框架，测量置换质量函数之间的距离是RPS理论中的关键研究课题。本文从随机有限集和可转移信念模型两个不同视角深入分析RPS之间的距离。

Method: 采用RPS的层-2信念结构解释，将RPST视为TBM的细化，其中有序焦点集中的顺序表示定性倾向。从置换出发，引入累积Jaccard指数的新定义来量化两个置换之间的相似性，并基于累积Jaccard指数矩阵提出RPS的距离度量方法。

Result: 研究了所提距离度量的度量和结构特性，包括累积Jaccard指数矩阵的正定性分析，并提供了修正方案。该方法具有自然的上权重特性：较高排名元素之间的不一致性往往导致更大的距离值。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提方法不仅克服了现有方法的缺点，与Jousselme距离兼容，而且具有更高的敏感性和灵活性。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Result: 成功训练了10亿参数的大语言模型，通过广泛实验提供了进化算法如何有效优化神经网络的关键见解。

Conclusion: 进化算法是训练大语言模型的有效替代方法，有望显著降低训练成本，使更多研究者能够参与深度学习研究。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体强化学习框架，协调领域专业智能体进行多模态文本到图像生成，通过PPO训练和复合奖励函数提升语义对齐和细节质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态文本到图像生成中语义对齐和专业级细节保持的困难

Method: 多智能体强化学习框架，包含文本增强和图像生成两个耦合子系统，使用PPO训练和复合奖励函数，通过对比学习、双向注意力和迭代反馈实现跨模态对齐

Result: 在六个实验设置中显著丰富生成内容（词数增加1614%），ROUGE-1分数降低69.7%，基于Transformer的融合方法获得最高综合得分0.521

Conclusion: 协作式、专业化驱动的架构在推进可靠多模态生成系统方面具有前景

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然学生满意度已被广泛研究，但可解释机器学习和神经网络等现代技术尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用结合提升和可解释性的APLR模型，与多种先进方法比较来预测学习满意度。

Result: APLR提供最佳拟合，通过数值和可视化解释识别出关键影响因素。

Conclusion: 影响因素可在个体层面解释，使教育者能根据学生特征定制教学。

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型和数学优化的混合框架，用于在线叫车平台的供需平衡问题，无需训练数据，通过LLM生成高层目标指导底层优化器，在纽约和芝加哥出租车数据集上相比现有方法平均提升16%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两类问题：强化学习方法数据效率低、对现实动态建模过于简化、难以强制执行操作约束；分解在线优化方法依赖人工设计的高层目标，缺乏对底层路由动态的认知。

Method: 提出训练免费的混合框架，将LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式，指导负责约束执行和实时决策的底层优化器。通过和谐搜索驱动的闭环进化过程，基于优化层的可行性和性能反馈迭代调整LLM提示。

Result: 在基于纽约和芝加哥出租车数据集的场景上进行广泛实验，相比最先进的基线方法平均提升16%的性能。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了在线叫车平台的供需平衡问题，通过LLM与数学优化的结合，克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出UCAS方法，通过利用模型内部不确定性信号来改进信用分配，解决强化学习中粗粒度优势信号导致的探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法如GRPO对所有token广播统一优势信号，忽视了推理过程中关键的不确定高风险决策，导致探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。

Method: UCAS采用两阶段机制：首先基于模型整体自信度调节响应级优势，然后基于原始logit确定性施加token级惩罚，鼓励探索高不确定性但正确的路径，惩罚过度自信的错误推理。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，UCAS显著优于强RLVR基线，包括1.5B和7B模型规模，不仅获得更高奖励，还促进更大推理多样性并成功缓解熵崩溃。

Conclusion: UCAS通过不确定性感知的优势塑造有效平衡了探索与利用的权衡，在强化学习验证奖励框架下显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估音频和视觉模态的协同推理能力，往往忽视其中一个模态或以逻辑不一致的方式整合它们。

Method: 构建包含1000个高质量问答对的大规模基准测试，涵盖628个多样化视频，每个问答对都有逐步推理轨迹，并手动验证确保正确性和唯一性。

Result: 多个MLLM在OmniVideoBench上的评估显示模型性能与人类推理存在显著差距，开源模型明显落后于闭源模型。

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench将公开发布，以促进具有更强和更通用推理能力的MLLM的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 传统推理演算基于二元归结，限制了多子句间的演绎协同。虽然CSE框架提出了动态多子句推理理论，但其算法实现尚未形式化。

Method: ETM在三角几何框架下统一了多种矛盾构建策略，包括标准扩展方法，支持灵活的子句交互和动态协同。

Result: ETM作为多个高性能定理证明器(CSE、CSE-E、CSI-E、CSI-Enig)的核心算法，在TPTP问题集和CASC 2018-2015基准测试中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: ETM将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且具有实际竞争力的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明的未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应选择符号语言的方法来提升LLMs的逻辑推理能力，通过为不同问题选择最优的符号语言形式化方法，显著提高了推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言问题转换为符号语言时，只关注语义相似度，忽略了不同符号语言类型本身对特定逻辑推理问题的适用性差异。

Method: 利用LLMs自适应选择最适合的符号语言（一阶逻辑、逻辑编程或布尔可满足性），然后将自然语言问题转换为目标符号语言表达式，并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出最终答案。

Result: 在基准测试中，自适应选择方法显著优于单一符号语言转换和随机选择方法。在混合数据集上达到96%的准确率，比一阶逻辑转换的最佳性能提高了25%。

Conclusion: 不同自然语言逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法，自适应选择目标符号语言能显著提升LLMs的逻辑推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

TL;DR: DRIFT框架通过将非正式数学陈述分解为子组件来改进LLMs的自动形式化，显著提升了前提检索效果和在定理证明中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于检索增强的自动形式化方法直接使用非正式陈述查询外部库，但忽略了非正式数学陈述通常复杂且缺乏上下文信息的局限性。

Method: 引入DRIFT框架，让LLMs将非正式数学陈述分解为更易处理的子组件，从而进行有针对性的前提检索，并从数学库中检索示例定理以帮助模型更有效地使用前提。

Result: 在多个基准测试中一致改进前提检索，在ProofNet上相比DPR基线F1分数几乎翻倍，在ConNF基准上使用GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1分别获得37.14%和42.25%的BEq+@10改进。

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中的检索效果高度依赖于模型特定的知识边界，需要与每个模型能力相适应的自适应检索策略。

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Motivation: 传统MAC协议需要手动配置，而基于深度强化学习的协议虽然能提升性能，但泛化性和鲁棒性差，需要昂贵的重新训练来适应动态环境。

Method: 将上行传输建模为动态多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，使用LLM驱动的智能体通过PPO协调生成自适应语义MAC协议，采用协议动作语法确保可靠性和效率。

Result: 仿真验证该框架比传统基线方法吞吐量提升77.6%，公平性提升65.2%，且能很好地泛化到用户数量波动的情况而无需重训练或架构改变。

Conclusion: 该LLM赋能的博弈论多智能体强化学习框架能够自动生成高性能、高泛化性的MAC协议，有效解决了传统方法在动态环境中的适应性问题。

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Motivation: 现有研究主要局限于单篇论文内的无工具任务，缺乏针对真实研究场景中跨论文推理和多工具协调的评估基准。

Method: 构建了一个模块化、可扩展的代理执行平台，提供多模态解析、上下文检索和程序化计算等工具，用于评估代理在解决需要整合多篇论文信息的真实研究问题时的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使最先进的LLM驱动的成熟代理系统平均准确率仅为38.78%，在困难子集上准确率降至18.47%，表明有巨大改进空间。所有测试代理都表现出工具使用效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: PaperArena揭示了当前LLM代理在科学发现任务中的局限性，邀请研究社区采用该基准来开发和评估更强大的科学发现代理。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

Motivation: 发现RAG代理存在工具调用黑客问题，即代理通过表面正确的工具调用来夸大奖励信号，而不真正利用检索证据，导致模式崩溃和虚假接地。

Method: 提出Proof-of-Use证据接地RL框架，通过统一的逐步合约结合语法引用验证、基于扰动的敏感性奖励和答案-证据对齐目标，确保工具使用的可解释性和功能性接地。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出模块化混合检索框架，集成知识库语言增强模型、深度图表示和嵌入驱动语义搜索，解决企业异构系统中复杂查询的上下文推理和多跳推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于关键词搜索或静态嵌入的检索方法难以处理需要跨工件上下文推理和多跳推理的复杂查询，企业知识分散在Jira、Git、Confluence等异构系统中。

Method: 构建统一知识图谱，集成KBLam模型、DeepGraph表示和语义搜索，通过查询分析动态确定最优检索策略，支持结构化和非结构化数据的独立或融合处理。

Result: 在大规模Git仓库上的实验表明，统一推理层相比独立GPT检索管道将答案相关性提升高达80%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过图构建、混合推理和交互式可视化的结合，为企业环境中的智能知识助手提供了可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在语义理解方面表现出色，但在精确的时空理解方面存在困难，限制了在具身智能和VR等需要高精度应用中的使用。

Method: 提出基于图的强化学习方法Video-STR，采用可验证奖励的强化学习和图基群相对策略优化机制，引导模型推理场景的时空拓扑结构，并构建了包含20.5万个问答对的STV-205k数据集。

Conclusion: Video-STR通过图基强化学习方法和专门构建的数据集，有效解决了多模态大语言模型在精确时空理解方面的局限性，为下游高精度应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

Motivation: 模型融合（特别是在Instruct和Thinking模型上）已显示出高效推理的显著性能，本文重新审视最简单的权重直接插值方法。

Method: 采用模型权重直接插值的方法，观察其推理轨迹上的三阶段演进动态，并通过模型层、模块和解码策略的广泛消融研究进行验证。

Result: 战略性插值模型在效率和效果上均超越了复杂的模型融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了模型插值的机制，并为构建具有精确目标推理能力的模型提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在制造系统中，识别故障原因对维持和提高生产效率至关重要。知识库需要明确结构化目标系统和故障知识，并包含足够长的故障因果链。

Method: 构建诊断知识本体论，提出基于功能-行为-结构模型的维护记录积累方法。

Result: 使用该方法积累的维护记录进行故障原因推断，与专家枚举的候选原因集表现出更好的匹配度，特别是在相关案例少且词汇不同的困难情况下。

Conclusion: 未来需要开发针对这些维护记录的推断方法，构建用户界面，并在更大更多样化的系统上进行验证。该方法有望成为整个工程链知识共享的基础。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在法律环境中的不透明性（黑箱问题）对公平性、问责制和信任构成挑战，需要符合法律要求的解释方法。

Method: 分析不同解释策略的优缺点，评估其在法律推理中的适用性，重点研究论证框架如何捕捉法律的可废止性、可争议性和价值敏感性特征。

Result: 论证框架为可解释法律AI提供了特别稳健的基础，能够更好地满足法律领域的透明性要求。

Conclusion: 计算论证方法最能满足法律领域的技术和规范透明性要求，但仍需解决偏见缓解、司法环境实证验证等开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based

expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了$How^{2}$框架，让AI代理能够询问如何做的问题、存储答案并在交互环境中重复使用以实现终身学习。在Minecraft制作环境中验证，发现抽象程度高的答案对代理学习最有益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理在规划问题时，通过询问如何做的问题可以减少不确定性并填补知识空白，但这类问题的开放性使其对AI代理和专家都具有挑战性。

Method: 引入$How^{2}$记忆代理框架，在Plancraft（Minecraft制作环境）中评估，使用不同抽象层次的教师模型回答问题，从可执行动作序列到高层子目标描述。

Result: 终身学习代理从抽象且与当前状态解耦的答案中获益最大，$How^{2}$为基于LLM的代理提供了在交互环境中通过提问提升规划能力的方法。

Conclusion: $How^{2}$框架使AI代理能够通过询问如何做的问题来持续改进其规划能力，特别是在交互环境中，抽象答案对学习效果最佳。

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

*Peiming Li,Zhiyuan Hu,Yang Tang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment (CDRA)方法，将LLM对齐从标量奖励匹配任务重构为结构化推理过程，通过DeepPref基准和Pers-GenPRM模型解决用户深层偏好推断和防御性推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法推断用户的深层隐含偏好（包括未陈述的目标、语义上下文和风险容忍度），并且缺乏应对现实世界模糊性的防御性推理能力，导致响应肤浅、脆弱和短视。

Method: 1) 引入DeepPref基准数据集（3000个偏好查询对，涵盖20个主题）；2) 提出个性化生成过程奖励模型(Pers-GenPRM)，将奖励建模构建为个性化推理任务；3) 通过Critique-Driven Policy Alignment进行过程级在线强化学习。

Result: 实验表明CDRA在发现和适应用户真实偏好方面表现出色，同时执行稳健的推理。

Conclusion: CDRA通过结构化推理过程有效解决了LLM个性化对齐中的认知差距问题，提供了可解释的、结构化的奖励信号来指导策略模型。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

Motivation: AI对齐技术都存在失效模式，防御纵深策略依赖于不同技术失效模式的不相关性，但需要实证验证这种不相关性程度

Method: 分析7种代表性对齐技术和7种失效模式，评估它们之间的重叠程度

Result: 发现不同对齐技术的失效模式存在不同程度的重叠，影响防御纵深策略的有效性

Conclusion: 需要根据失效模式相关性来评估当前风险水平和优先研究方向

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能代理在执行自然语言程序（如食谱、科学协议等）时因文本变异性大、缺乏结构而导致的执行漂移或失败问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Teach阶段将程序文本转化为包含任务依赖、决策点和可重用于程序的图结构；Execute阶段基于实时输入和环境反馈进行动态执行。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld等四个不同基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明了图表示在减少长时程推理错误积累方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于图的程序表示为智能代理提供了强大的中间抽象层，能够实现鲁棒且可泛化的自动化执行。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Conclusion: 该框架、基准和指标为开发忠实于本体的技能分解系统提供了可重现的基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

these factors to improve diagnostic accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型多步推理方法存在局限：结果监督强化学习只奖励正确答案但传播错误推理，过程级奖励模型缺乏泛化性和可解释性且需要任务特定的推理过程分割。

Method: 提出维度级奖励模型(DRM)，从三个基本维度评估推理过程：置信度用于不确定性校准，相关性用于语义对齐，连贯性用于逻辑一致性。这些维度无需真实答案即可进行可解释的评估。

Result: 实验表明DRM能提供有效的监督信号，指导大语言模型优化并增强其推理能力。在数学、问答、代码执行和谜题等开放领域任务上，DRM监督训练在分布内和分布外都取得了持续增益。

Conclusion: 多维度的推理过程监督可以提升大语言模型在训练分布之外的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain

Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the

*Yisen Gao,Jiaxin Bai,Yi Huang,Xingcheng Fu,Qingyun Sun,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DARK是一个统一框架，用于知识图谱中的演绎和溯因推理，通过掩码扩散模型捕获查询与结论间的双向关系，在两种推理任务上均达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理知识图谱的演绎推理（检索满足复杂逻辑查询的实体）和溯因推理（从观察生成合理逻辑假设），但两者具有协同潜力，需要统一框架来结合它们。

Method: 提出DARK框架，采用掩码扩散模型：1）自反去噪过程迭代生成和验证候选假设；2）逻辑探索强化学习方法同时掩码查询和结论，探索新颖推理组合。

Result: 在多个基准知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，DARK在演绎和溯因推理任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 统一演绎和溯因推理的方法具有显著优势，DARK框架成功展示了这种协同效应，为知识图谱推理提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI
and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies
for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CC-Gen基准生成器和CAP-CPT方法，用于解决LLM智能体系统中策略文档内部化的问题，通过可控复杂度评估和针对性预训练提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体系统依赖策略文档，但随着需求增长文档快速扩展导致计算开销高，需要将策略文档嵌入模型先验中同时保持性能。

Method: 引入CC-Gen基准生成器控制四个复杂度级别，提出CAP-CPT方法自动解析策略文档并分类为事实性、行为性和条件性规范，通过针对性数据合成和自回归预训练损失实现策略内部化。

Result: CAP-CPT在所有设置下都优于SFT基线，在Qwen-3-32B上提升达41%和22%，在CC-Gen上实现97.3%的提示长度减少，并在少量SFT数据下进一步提升tau-Bench性能。

Conclusion: CAP-CPT方法有效缓解了数据和推理负担，显著提升了策略内部化效果，特别是在处理复杂策略规范时表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

TL;DR: 论文主张AI研究应采用更严格的复现性指南来帮助治理工作，通过预注册、提高统计功效和发表阴性结果等协议来改善AI风险共识，认为复现性协议应是AI治理的核心工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI政策制定者面临信息环境中信号噪声比过低的问题，这助长了监管捕获，并导致在应优先治理哪些风险方面存在深度不确定性和分歧。AI研究的快速发表速度加上缺乏强有力的科学标准，削弱了政策制定者制定有意义的政策和治理协议的能力。

Method: 通过评估AI研究中即将到来的复现性危机，借鉴其他科学领域的危机经验，提出采用预注册、提高统计功效和发表阴性结果等复现性协议。

Result: 论文认为采用更严格的复现性指南可以帮助改善AI风险共识，使AI治理更加有效。

Conclusion: 虽然AI治理必须具有反应性，但政策制定者和政府应将复现性协议视为治理武器库中的核心工具，并要求AI研究达到更高标准。

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个结合可解释AI、生存分析和RFM分析的三组件框架，用于客户流失预测和个性化保留策略设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流失模型多为黑盒，缺乏对流失驱动因素、干预时机和高风险客户群体的洞察，需要从单纯预测转向基于可解释证据的个性化保留策略。

Method: 集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模流失风险时间、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户的三组件框架。

Result: 能够识别流失驱动因素、估计干预窗口、优先处理目标细分群体，支持减少流失和增强客户忠诚度的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解释性分析、时间建模和行为细分，为设计有效的客户保留策略提供了全面支持。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体基准主要关注任务完成度，但忽略了并行和异步操作中的时间效率问题，需要专门评估多智能体系统的时间效率规划能力。

Method: 通过ParaCook基准环境，将多智能体系统实例化为烹饪任务，使用简化的动作空间来隔离核心的并行策略规划挑战，并对最先进的LLM进行全面评估。

Result: 当前方法生成的规划方案表现不佳，难以处理并行动作或协调问题，但在抽象任务中LLM展现出专注于高层并行优化的潜力。

Conclusion: ParaCook提供了一个可扩展的评估框架，为开发和评估时间效率感知的多智能体规划奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Conclusion: SR-Scientist成功将LLM转变为自主AI科学家，显著提升了科学方程发现的性能，证明了端到端强化学习框架的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Quant achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) result, with an overall medal rate
of 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the highest recorded performance
among all evaluated systems to date. The architecture demonstrates that a
linear, non-blocking agent, operating autonomously within a controlled IDE
environment, can outperform multi-agent and orchestrated systems under
identical constraints.

Conclusion: 通过领域特定的宪法AI训练，可以构建更安全、更适应的AI系统，有效支持心理健康应用的发展，特别是在资源有限的环境中。

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational
health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI
in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved
communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness
platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond
general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or
symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid
severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances,
general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in
resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where
generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an
approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health
principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health
applications.

Motivation: 在实践中，稳定分配很少能实现，因为匹配往往是次优的，特别是在在线设置中，代理按顺序到达市场。

Method: 引入并比较了两种互补的次优匹配分配不稳定性度量，建立了它们与底层匹配最优性比率的联系。

Result: 使用该框架研究了在线分配游戏中随机算法的稳定性表现。

Conclusion: 为次优匹配分配提供了不稳定性分析框架，有助于理解在线分配游戏的稳定性特征。

Abstract: The assignment game models a housing market where buyers and sellers are
matched, and transaction prices are set so that the resulting allocation is
stable. Shapley and Shubik showed that every stable allocation is necessarily
built on a maximum social welfare matching. In practice, however, stable
allocations are rarely attainable, as matchings are often sub-optimal,
particularly in online settings where eagents arrive sequentially to the
market. In this paper, we introduce and compare two complementary measures of
instability for allocations with sub-optimal matchings, establish their
connections to the optimality ratio of the underlying matching, and use this
framework to study the stability performances of randomized algorithms in
online assignment games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不可分割杂务分配问题，在考虑不同权重代理的情况下，同时保证公平性和效率。先前工作虽然实现了比例公平性，但方法复杂且未保证经济效率。

Method: 首先计算比例公平的竞争均衡，然后应用基于最小痛苦每单位成本边的舍入过程。

Result: 算法在多项式时间内实现了与先前工作相同的补贴上界(n/3-1/6)，同时确保了帕累托最优性，且方法和分析更简单。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证公平性和效率的同时，显著简化了算法设计和分析过程，为不可分割杂务分配提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating $m$ indivisible chores among $n$ agents
with possibly different weights, aiming for a solution that is both fair and
efficient. Specifically, we focus on the classic fairness notion of
proportionality and efficiency notion of Pareto-optimality. Since proportional
allocations may not always exist in this setting, we allow the use of subsidies
(monetary compensation to agents) to ensure agents are
proportionally-satisfied, and aim to minimize the total subsidy required. Wu
and Zhou (WINE 2024) showed that when each chore has disutility at most 1, a
total subsidy of at most $n/3 - 1/6$ is sufficient to guarantee
proportionality. However, their approach is based on a complex technique, which
does not guarantee economic efficiency - a key desideratum in fair division.
  In this work, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the same
subsidy bound while also ensuring Pareto-optimality. Moreover, both our
algorithm and its analysis are significantly simpler than those of Wu and Zhou
(WINE 2024). Our approach first computes a proportionally-fair competitive
equilibrium, and then applies a rounding procedure guided by
minimum-pain-per-buck edges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不可分割物品的公平分配中，最大最小份额(MMS)是最重要的基于份额的公平概念。虽然已知某些情况下无法保证比1-1/n^4更好的近似比，但当前最佳算法只能达到3/4 + 3/3836的近似保证，存在改进空间。

Method: 未在摘要中明确说明具体方法，但通过研究改进了MMS的近似算法。

Result: 成功将MMS的近似保证从3/4 + 3/3836提升到10/13，显著缩小了理论界限与实际算法性能之间的差距。

Conclusion: 这项工作在不可分割物品公平分配领域取得了重要进展，为最大最小份额提供了更好的近似保证。

Abstract: The maximin share ($\textsf{MMS}$) is the most prominent share-based fairness
notion in the fair allocation of indivisible goods. Recent years have seen
significant efforts to improve the approximation guarantees for $\textsf{MMS}$
for different valuation classes, particularly for additive valuations. For the
additive setting, it has been shown that for some instances, no allocation can
guarantee a factor better than $1-\tfrac{1}{n^4}$ of maximin share value to all
agents. However, the best currently known algorithm achieves an approximation
guarantee of $\tfrac{3}{4} + \tfrac{3}{3836}$ for $\textsf{MMS}$. In this work,
we narrow this gap and improve the best-known approximation guarantee for
$\textsf{MMS}$ to $\tfrac{10}{13}$.

Motivation: 在对称设置下，不可分割物品和杂务都存在常数倍MMS分配保证，但当代理人有不同权益时，情况变得复杂。对于杂务分配，之前只知存在O(log n)-WMMS分配，需要改进这个上界。

Method: 作者改进了加权MMS分配的分析方法，证明了常数倍WMMS分配的存在性。

Result: 证明了存在20-WMMS分配（常数倍保证），且通过更严格的分析可能得到更好的常数因子。

Conclusion: 对于不可分割杂务的加权分配问题，常数倍WMMS保证是可达的，这显著改进了之前O(log n)的界。

Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning indivisible chores to agents with
different entitlements in the maximin share value (\MMS) context. While
constant-\MMS\ allocations/assignments are guaranteed to exist for both goods
and chores in the symmetric setting, the situation becomes much more complex
when agents have different entitlements. For the allocation of indivisible
goods, it has been proven that an $n$-\WMMS\ (weighted \MMS) guarantee is the
best one can hope for. For indivisible chores, however, it was recently
discovered that an $O(\log n)$-\WMMS\ assignment is guaranteed to exist. In
this work, we improve this upper bound to a constant-\WMMS\
guarantee.\footnote{We prove the existence of a 20-\WMMS\ assignment, but we
did not attempt to optimize the constant factor. We believe our methods already
yield a slightly better bound with a tighter analysis.}

Conclusion: 提出的基于权重的成本分配规则能有效平衡系统效率和个体理性，在联合补货模型中实现良好的博弈均衡性能，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We analyze an infinite-horizon deterministic joint replenishment model from a
non-cooperative game-theoretical approach. In this model, a group of retailers
can choose to jointly place an order, which incurs a major setup cost
independent of the group, and a minor setup cost for each retailer.
Additionally, each retailer is associated with a holding cost. Our objective is
to design cost allocation rules that minimize the long-run average system cost
while accounting for the fact that each retailer independently selects its
replenishment interval to minimize its own cost. We introduce a class of cost
allocation rules that distribute the major setup cost among the associated
retailers in proportion to their predefined weights. For these rules, we
establish a monotonicity property of agent better responses, which enables us
to prove the existence of a payoff dominant pure Nash equilibrium that can also
be computed efficiently. We then analyze the efficiency of these equilibria by
examining the price of stability (PoS), the ratio of the best Nash
equilibrium's system cost to the social optimum, across different information
settings. In particular, our analysis reveals that one rule, which leverages
retailers' own holding cost rates, achieves a near-optimal PoS of 1.25, while
another rule that does not require access to retailers' private information
also yields a favorable PoS.

Abstract: Firms (businesses, service providers, entertainment organizations, political
parties, etc.) advertise on social networks to draw people's attention and
improve their awareness of the brands of the firms. In all such cases, the
competitive nature of their engagements gives rise to a game where the firms
need to decide how to distribute their budget over the agents on a network to
maximize their brand's awareness. The firms (players) therefore need to
optimize how much budget they should put on the vertices of the network so that
the spread improves via direct (via advertisements or free promotional offers)
and indirect marketing (words-of-mouth). We propose a two-timescale model of
decisions where the communication between the vertices happen in a faster
timescale and the strategy update of the firms happen in a slower timescale. We
show that under fairly standard conditions, the best response dynamics of the
firms converge to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. However, such equilibria
can be away from a socially optimal one. We provide a characterization of the
contest success functions and provide examples for the designers of such
contests (e.g., regulators, social network providers, etc.) such that the Nash
equilibrium becomes unique and social welfare maximizing. Our experiments show
that for realistic scenarios, such contest success functions perform fairly
well.

### [566] [Temporal Cooperative Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11255)
*Ashwin Goyal,Drashthi Doshi,Swaprava Nath*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了时序合作博弈(TCG)框架，其中联盟价值取决于代理加入顺序而非仅代理集合。定义了三个关键性质：最优到达激励(I4OA)、在线个体理性(OIR)和序列效率(SE)。发现满足这些性质的奖励分配机制与Shapley值的自然类比存在根本冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合作博弈理论假设联盟价值仅取决于代理集合，但实践中价值可能还取决于代理加入顺序。需要重新思考时序场景下的基础公理。

Method: 引入时序合作博弈(TCG)框架，定义三个关键性质(I4OA、OIR、SE)，构造Shapley值在时序场景下的两种自然类比(序列世界和扩展世界)。

Result: 识别了一类唯一由I4OA、OIR、SE三个性质刻画的奖励分配机制。发现Shapley类比与这些时序性质机制存在根本冲突，即使在凸和简单TCG等受限类中也是如此。

Conclusion: 当时序性成为关键因素时，满足理想时序性质的奖励分配机制必须与Shapley启发的方法本质不同，这为在TCG中定义公平高效解概念提出了新问题。

Abstract: Classical cooperative game theory assumes that the worth of a coalition
depends only on the set of agents involved, but in practice, it may also depend
on the order in which agents arrive. Motivated by such scenarios, we introduce
temporal cooperative games (TCG), where the worth $v$ becomes a function of the
sequence of agents $\pi$ rather than just the set $S$. This shift calls for
rethinking the underlying axioms. A key property in this temporal framework is
the incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), which encourages agents to join in
the order maximizing total worth. Alongside, we define two additional
properties: online individual rationality (OIR), incentivizing earlier agents
to invite more participants, and sequential efficiency (SE), ensuring that the
total worth of any sequence is fully distributed among its agents. We identify
a class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by these three
properties. The classical Shapley value does not directly apply here, so we
construct its natural analogs in two variants: the sequential world, where
rewards are defined for each sequence-player pair, and the extended world,
where rewards are defined for each player alone. Properties of efficiency,
additivity, and null player uniquely determine these Shapley analogs in both
worlds. Importantly, the Shapley analogs are disjoint from mechanisms
satisfying I4OA, OIR, and SE, and this conflict persists even for restricted
classes such as convex and simple TCGs. Our findings thus uncover a fundamental
tension: when players arrive sequentially, reward-sharing mechanisms satisfying
desirable temporal properties must inherently differ from Shapley-inspired
ones, opening new questions for defining fair and efficient solution concepts
in TCGs.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了完美信息随机博弈中计算稳态纳什均衡的计算复杂度问题，证明了两人博弈是PPAD完全的，三人博弈中可能不存在有理数值稳态纳什均衡，四人博弈计算稳态纳什均衡是SqrtSum困难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究完美信息随机博弈中稳态纳什均衡的计算复杂度，旨在精确分类这类问题的计算复杂性类别。

Method: 使用计算复杂度理论方法，包括PPAD完全性证明、构造反例证明不存在性、以及SqrtSum困难性证明。

Result: 两人完美信息随机博弈计算稳态纳什均衡是PPAD完全的；三人博弈中可能不存在有理数值稳态纳什均衡；四人博弈计算稳态纳什均衡是SqrtSum困难的。

Conclusion: 完美信息随机博弈中稳态纳什均衡的计算复杂度随玩家数量增加而显著提高，从两人博弈的PPAD完全性到四人博弈的SqrtSum困难性。

Abstract: We study the problem of computing stationary Nash equilibria in discounted
perfect information stochastic games from the viewpoint of computational
complexity. For two-player games we prove the problem to be in PPAD, which
together with a previous PPAD-hardness result precisely classifies the problem
as PPAD-complete. In addition to this we give an improved and simpler
PPAD-hardness proof for computing a stationary epsilon-Nash equilibrium. For
3-player games we construct games showing that rational-valued stationary Nash
equilibria are not guaranteed to exist, and we use these to prove
SqrtSum-hardness of computing a stationary Nash equilibrium in 4-player games.

TL;DR: 在多候选人批准选举中，当候选人数量很多时，选民可能难以确定对所有候选人的偏好。本文研究在一维偏好设置下，如何通过减少通信来提供公平性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多候选人批准选举中，选民可能难以确定对所有候选人的偏好，因此需要探索在减少通信的情况下能否提供公平性保证。

Method: 提出一个概率偏好模型，选民集合包含σ个不同群体，每个群体与ℝ上的分布相关联。提出一种算法，通过查询选民偏好来计算提供PJR+公平性保证的委员会。

Result: 该算法在期望上对每个选民进行O(log(σ·k))次查询，其中k是期望的委员会规模。

Conclusion: 在一维偏好设置下，可以通过相对较少的查询次数实现公平的委员会选举。

Abstract: In multiwinner approval elections with many candidates, voters may struggle
to determine their preferences over the entire slate of candidates. It is
therefore of interest to explore which (if any) fairness guarantees can be
provided under reduced communication. In this paper, we consider voters with
one-dimensional preferences: voters and candidates are associated with points
in $\mathbb R$, and each voter's approval set forms an interval of $\mathbb R$.
We put forward a probabilistic preference model, where the voter set consists
of $\sigma$ different groups; each group is associated with a distribution over
an interval of $\mathbb R$, so that each voter draws the endpoints of her
approval interval from the distribution associated with her group. We present
an algorithm for computing committees that provide Proportional Justified
Representation + (PJR+), which proceeds by querying voters' preferences, and
show that, in expectation, it makes $\mathcal{O}(\log( \sigma\cdot k))$ queries
per voter, where $k$ is the desired committee size.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于VPN网络流量分析的隐私保护方法，用于大规模研究学生使用AI工具的行为模式，弥补了传统调查方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调查方法存在回忆偏差、自我呈现效应和习惯性行为漏报等问题，而人种学方法又面临规模和可重复性挑战，需要一种能捕捉真实使用行为的大规模研究方法。

Method: 采用基于VPN的网络流量分析技术，捕获匿名化元数据而非内容，实现细粒度行为追踪，同时保护个人信息。进行了为期三周的实地部署研究。

Result: 发现学生与AI工具的交互呈现碎片化、短时长的特点，跨多个工具和设备，在考试期间出现密集活动爆发，反映了学术生活的制度性节奏。

Conclusion: 网络流量分析为大规模数字人种学研究技术实践提供了有前景的途径，具有方法论、伦理和实证方面的重要意义。

Abstract: AI-driven applications have become woven into students' academic and creative
workflows, influencing how they learn, write, and produce ideas. Gaining a
nuanced understanding of these usage patterns is essential, yet conventional
survey and interview methods remain limited by recall bias, self-presentation
effects, and the underreporting of habitual behaviors. While ethnographic
methods offer richer contextual insights, they often face challenges of scale
and reproducibility. To bridge this gap, we introduce a privacy-conscious
approach that repurposes VPN-based network traffic analysis as a scalable
ethnographic technique for examining students' real-world engagement with AI
tools. By capturing anonymized metadata rather than content, this method
enables fine-grained behavioral tracing while safeguarding personal
information, thereby complementing self-report data. A three-week field
deployment with university students reveals fragmented, short-duration
interactions across multiple tools and devices, with intense bursts of activity
coinciding with exam periods-patterns mirroring institutional rhythms of
academic life. We conclude by discussing methodological, ethical, and empirical
implications, positioning network traffic analysis as a promising avenue for
large-scale digital ethnography on technology-in-practice.

Motivation: 解决假设分析领域缺乏统一框架的问题，各种分析技术虽然概念和方法相似，但缺乏标准化的定义和分类。

Method: 回顾了2014-2024年间141篇视觉分析和人机交互领域的出版物，提出Praxa结构化框架来识别假设分析的基本组件和类型。

Result: 建立了假设分析的标准化词汇和结构理解，能够实现跨领域的一致使用和更清晰的概念交流。

Conclusion: Praxa框架为假设分析提供了统一的理论基础，识别了相关挑战和开放研究问题，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Various analytical techniques-such as scenario modeling, sensitivity
analysis, perturbation-based analysis, counterfactual analysis, and parameter
space analysis-are used across domains to explore hypothetical scenarios,
examine input-output relationships, and identify pathways to desired results.
Although termed differently, these methods share common concepts and methods,
suggesting unification under what-if analysis. Yet a unified framework to
define motivations, core components, and its distinct types is lacking. To
address this gap, we reviewed 141 publications from leading visual analytics
and HCI venues (2014-2024). Our analysis (1) outlines the motivations for
what-if analysis, (2) introduces Praxa, a structured framework that identifies
its fundamental components and characterizes its distinct types, and (3)
highlights challenges associated with the application and implementation.
Together, our findings establish a standardized vocabulary and structural
understanding, enabling more consistent use across domains and communicate with
greater conceptual clarity. Finally, we identify open research problems and
future directions to advance what-if analysis.

Motivation: 研究LLM如何策划和呈现集体记忆，探索艺术研究项目在向公众传播AI研究方面的潜力。

Method: 在维也纳为期两个月的公共装置中，让访客与5个LLM互动进行角色扮演游戏，收集交互协议和定性对话，并对115个LLM生成的介绍文本进行NLP分析。

Result: 定性反馈识别出三种用户类型，定量分析显示不同LLM在呈现历史内容方面存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅有助于分析LLM性能，还展示了以游戏化方式向公众传播AI研究的有效途径。

Abstract: The paper presents the first results of an artistic research project
investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) curate and present collective
memory. In a public installation exhibited during two months in Vienna in 2025,
visitors could interact with five different LLMs (ChatGPT with GPT 4o and GPT
4o mini, Mistral Large, DeepSeek-Chat, and a locally run Llama 3.1 model),
which were instructed to act as narrators, implementing a role-playing game
revolving around the murder of Austrian philosopher Moritz Schlick in 1936.
Results of the investigation include protocols of LLM-user interactions during
the game and qualitative conversations after the play experience to get insight
into the players' reactions to the game. In a quantitative analysis 115
introductory texts for role-playing generated by the LLMs were examined by
different methods of natural language processing, including semantic similarity
and sentiment analysis. While the qualitative player feedback allowed to
distinguish three distinct types of users, the quantitative text analysis
showed significant differences between how the different LLMs presented the
historical content. Our study thus adds to ongoing efforts to analyse LLM
performance, but also suggests a way of how these efforts can be disseminated
in a playful way to a general audience.

Motivation: 随着AI和大语言模型的快速发展，需要研究当团队中有一个"队友"不是人类时，团队动态会发生什么变化。

Method: 使用专门设计的人机协作研究平台收集话语数据，采用LIWC和GCA两种自然语言处理方法分析人机协作实验。

Result: AI队友通常扮演主导的认知促进者角色，指导、规划和推动群体决策，但以社交疏离的方式，经常以冗长重复的方式推进议程。人类与AI合作时使用更多反映社会过程的语言。

Conclusion: 学习分析可以提供对人机协作社会认知动态的关键洞察，AI在认知层面主导但社交层面疏离，人类则承担更多社交功能。

Abstract: Research on Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) has traditionally examined
how humans rely on one another cognitively and socially to accomplish tasks
together. With the rapid advancement of AI and large language models, however,
a new question emerge: what happens to team dynamics when one of the
"teammates" is not human? In this study, we investigate how the integration of
an AI teammate -- a fully autonomous GPT-4 agent with social, cognitive, and
affective capabilities -- shapes the socio-cognitive dynamics of CPS. We
analyze discourse data collected from human-AI teaming (HAT) experiments
conducted on a novel platform specifically designed for HAT research. Using two
natural language processing (NLP) methods, specifically Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) and Group Communication Analysis (GCA), we found that AI
teammates often assumed the role of dominant cognitive facilitators, guiding,
planning, and driving group decision-making. However, they did so in a socially
detached manner, frequently pushing agenda in a verbose and repetitive way. By
contrast, humans working with AI used more language reflecting social
processes, suggesting that they assumed more socially oriented roles. Our study
highlights how learning analytics can provide critical insights into the
socio-cognitive dynamics of human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 儿童牙科焦虑普遍存在，传统干预方法有限，VR技术的沉浸式和趣味性特点为增强现有干预效果提供了新机会

Method: 与13名10-12岁儿童进行共同设计工作坊，随后访谈13名家长和2名牙医，探索VR在牙科焦虑管理中的应用

Result: 儿童期望VR能提供即时缓解、社交支持和治疗过程中的控制感；家长希望VR能提供口腔健康教育；牙医关注治疗效率和安全性

Conclusion: 讨论了多利益相关者在开发儿童牙科焦虑管理VR应用时的考虑因素，这些发现可推广到其他医疗场景

Abstract: Dental anxiety is prevalent among children, often leading to missed treatment
and potential negative effects on their mental well-being. While several
interventions (e.g., pharmacological and psychotherapeutic techniques) have
been introduced for anxiety alleviation, the recently emerged virtual reality
(VR) technology, with its immersive and playful nature, opened new
opportunities for complementing and enhancing the therapeutic effects of
existing interventions. In this light, we conducted a series of co-design
workshops with 13 children aged 10-12 to explore how they envisioned using VR
to address their fear and stress associated with dental visits, followed by
interviews with parents (n = 13) and two dentists. Our findings revealed that
children expected VR to provide immediate relief, social support, and a sense
of control during dental treatment, parents sought educational opportunities
for their children to learn about oral health, and dentists prioritized
treatment efficiency and safety issues. Drawing from the findings, we discuss
the considerations of multi-stakeholders for developing VR-assisted anxiety
management applications for children within and beyond dental settings.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI系统被患者用于日常健康指导，其可靠性和临床适用性存在不确定性，需要评估AI生成健康信息的质量。

Method: 采用混合方法研究：研究1分析784个真实患者问题，识别信息需求类别和评估维度；研究2由7名内分泌科医生评估4个主流AI模型在这些维度上的表现。

Result: AI在事实和生活方式指导方面表现一致良好，但在药物解释、情境推理和共情方面存在显著弱点。患者将AI视为"就诊前教育者"，而临床医生强调其缺乏临床安全性和个性化。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly adopted by patients seeking everyday
health guidance, yet their reliability and clinical appropriateness remain
uncertain. Taking Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) as a representative chronic
condition, this paper presents a two-part mixed-methods study that examines how
patients and physicians in China evaluate the quality and usability of
AI-generated health information. Study~1 analyzes 784 authentic patient
questions to identify seven core categories of informational needs and five
evaluation dimensions -- \textit{Accuracy, Safety, Clarity, Integrity}, and
\textit{Action Orientation}. Study~2 involves seven endocrinologists who assess
responses from four mainstream AI models across these dimensions. Quantitative
and qualitative findings reveal consistent strengths in factual and lifestyle
guidance but significant weaknesses in medication interpretation, contextual
reasoning, and empathy. Patients view AI as an accessible ``pre-visit
educator,'' whereas clinicians highlight its lack of clinical safety and
personalization. Together, the findings inform design implications for
interactive health systems, advocating for multi-model orchestration,
risk-aware fallback mechanisms, and emotionally attuned communication to ensure
trustworthy AI assistance in chronic disease care.

Motivation: 基于提示的交互存在关键限制：用户难以指定任务程序化要求，特别是依赖个人偏好的任务，且成功提示无法跨任务复用。

Method: 受编程演示(PBD)启发，ALLOY让用户通过自然演示表达程序化偏好，将演示转化为透明可编辑的可视化工作流，可跨任务变体泛化。

Result: 12名参与者的研究表明，ALLOY的基于演示方法在复杂网页任务中优于基于提示的代理和手动工作流，能更好捕捉用户意图和程序化偏好。

Conclusion: 基于演示的交互补充了传统的基于提示方法，通过演示和可视化工作流提升了LLM网页代理的适应性和用户意图捕捉能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable end-users to delegate complex tasks to
autonomous agents through natural language. However, prompt-based interaction
faces critical limitations: Users often struggle to specify procedural
requirements for tasks, especially those that don't have a factually correct
solution but instead rely on personal preferences, such as posting social media
content or planning a trip. Additionally, a ''successful'' prompt for one task
may not be reusable or generalizable across similar tasks. We present ALLOY, a
system inspired by classical HCI theories on Programming by Demonstration
(PBD), but extended to enhance adaptability in creating LLM-based web agents.
ALLOY enables users to express procedural preferences through natural
demonstrations rather than prompts, while making these procedures transparent
and editable through visualized workflows that can be generalized across task
variations. In a study with 12 participants, ALLOY's demonstration--based
approach outperformed prompt-based agents and manual workflows in capturing
user intent and procedural preferences in complex web tasks. Insights from the
study also show how demonstration--based interaction complements the
traditional prompt-based approach.

Result: 研究1识别出多个相互关联的变量（能动性、准社会互动、参与度）塑造AI陪伴关系。研究2发现参与者对通用聊天机器人的感知在第3周显著趋近于对其专属AI伴侣的感知。

Conclusion: 研究提出了AI陪伴关系发展的纵向模型，并展示了研究人机陪伴关系的实证方法，揭示了AI伴侣感知的动态演变过程。

Abstract: The quickly growing popularity of AI companions poses risks to mental health,
personal wellbeing, and social relationships. Past work has identified many
individual factors that can drive human-companion interaction, but we know
little about how these factors interact and evolve over time. In Study 1, we
surveyed AI companion users (N = 303) to map the psychological pathway from
users' mental models of the agent to parasocial experiences, social
interaction, and the psychological impact of AI companions. Participants'
responses foregrounded multiple interconnected variables (agency, parasocial
interaction, and engagement) that shape AI companionship. In Study 2, we
conducted a longitudinal study with a subset of participants (N = 110) using a
new generic chatbot. Participants' perceptions of the generic chatbot
significantly converged to perceptions of their own companions by Week 3. These
results suggest a longitudinal model of AI companionship development and
demonstrate an empirical method to study human-AI companionship.

Motivation: 建立音高与色调之间的历史联系，提供创新的教育和艺术表演可能性，通过多模态系统增强用户与和声内容的互动。

Method: 使用CQT色度特征进行和弦估计和可视化，通过阈值滤波和音调增强分离根音、三音和五音，计算置信度确保可靠性，动态更新彩色键盘布局和LED空间反馈。

Result: 系统能够可靠检测并可视化中等至强确定性的和弦，提供动态彩色键盘和LED显示，但存在轻微延迟且无法检测扩展和弦。

Conclusion: 该系统为音乐教育和艺术表演提供了创新工具，未来将通过改进滤波算法、支持复杂和声、比较音频分析库以及用户测试来提升性能和用户体验。

Abstract: This paper introduces Chord Colourizer, a near real-time system that detects
the musical key of an audio signal and visually represents it through a novel
graphical user interface (GUI). The system assigns colours to musical notes
based on Isaac Newton's original colour wheel, preserving historical links
between pitch and hue, and also integrates an Arduino-controlled LED display
using 3D-printed star-shaped diffusers to offer a physical ambient media
representation. The method employs Constant-Q Transform (CQT) chroma features
for chord estimation and visualization, followed by threshold-based filtering
and tonal enhancement to isolate the root, third, and fifth. A confidence score
is computed for each detection to ensure reliability, and only chords with
moderate to very strong certainty are visualized. The graphical interface
dynamically updates a colour-coded keyboard layout, while the LED display
provides the same colour information via spatial feedback. This multi-modal
system enhances user interaction with harmonic content, offering innovative
possibilities for education and artistic performance. Limitations include
slight latency and the inability to detect extended chords, which future
development will aim to address through refined filtering, adaptive thresholds,
and support for more complex harmonies such as sevenths and augmented chords.
Future work will also explore integration with alternative visualization
styles, and the comparison of audio analysis libraries to improve detection
speed and precision. Plans also include formal user testing to evaluate
perception, usability, and cross-cultural interpretations of colour-pitch
mappings.

Result: 识别出信任的四个关键维度：情感信任、能力信任、善意与诚信、感知风险。通过潜在剖面分析将用户分为六个不同的信任档案，揭示了情感-能力信任和信任-不信任框架在个体和文化间的共存差异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为测量生成式AI中的信任提供了一个经过验证的、文化敏感的工具，为人机交互中信任如何演变提供了新的见解，通过整合工具性和关系性的信任视角，为更细致地研究和设计可信AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Trust is one of the most important factors shaping whether and how people
adopt and rely on artificial intelligence (AI). Yet most existing studies
measure trust in terms of functionality, focusing on whether a system is
reliable, accurate, or easy to use, while giving less attention to the social
and emotional dimensions that are increasingly relevant for today's generative
AI (GenAI) systems. These systems do not just process information; they
converse, respond, and collaborate with users, blurring the line between tool
and partner. In this study, we introduce and validate the Human-AI Trust Scale
(HAITS), a new measure designed to capture both the rational and relational
aspects of trust in GenAI. Drawing on prior trust theories, qualitative
interviews, and two waves of large-scale surveys in China and the United
States, we used exploratory (n = 1,546) and confirmatory (n = 1,426) factor
analyses to identify four key dimensions of trust: Affective Trust, Competence
Trust, Benevolence & Integrity, and Perceived Risk. We then applied latent
profile analysis to classify users into six distinct trust profiles, revealing
meaningful differences in how affective-competence trust and trust-distrust
frameworks coexist across individuals and cultures. Our findings offer a
validated, culturally sensitive tool for measuring trust in GenAI and provide
new insight into how trust evolves in human-AI interaction. By integrating
instrumental and relational perspectives of trust, this work lays the
foundation for more nuanced research and design of trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 批判人机交互领域中人本设计的局限性，寻求通过界面中心设计来重新思考人类、界面与环境的关系。

Method: 基于Hookway的界面哲学、现象学和具身交互理论，开发Umbilink脐带交互设备，通过半结构化访谈收集参与者体验，并使用扎根理论进行分析。

Result: 提出了脐带交互这一新型界面类型，展示了物质化界面在人类-界面-环境关系中的认知价值，强调了穿着仪式作为阈限体验的设计作用。

Conclusion: 作为试点研究，该设计为治疗、冥想和睡眠等领域提供了想象性应用，并为未来界面研究提供了思辨工具。

Abstract: This paper critiques the limits of human-centered design in HCI, proposing a
shift toward Interface-Centered Design. Drawing on Hookway's philosophy of
interfaces, phenomenology, and embodied interaction, we created Umbilink, an
umbilical interaction device simulating a uterine environment with tactile
sensors and rhythmic feedback to induce a pre-subjectivized state of sensory
reduction. Participants' experiences were captured through semi-structured
interviews and analyzed with grounded theory. Our contributions are: (1)
introducing the novel interface type of Umbilical Interaction; (2)
demonstrating the cognitive value of materialized interfaces in a
human-interface-environment relation; (3) highlighting the design role of
wearing rituals as liminal experiences. As a pilot study, this design suggests
imaginative applications in healing, meditation, and sleep, while offering a
speculative tool for future interface research.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个结合心理测量、行为分析和机器学习的集成框架，通过无监督聚类识别出四种玩家原型：沉浸式社交故事寻求者、自律优化者、战略系统导航者和竞争性团队建设者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 玩家画像分析对于自适应游戏设计、行为理解和数字福祉至关重要，需要开发能够揭示潜在玩家角色的数据驱动方法。

Method: 采用250名参与者的结构化调查，结合特征工程、关联网络分析、知识图谱和无监督聚类，使用多种相关性统计方法和降维技术进行模式识别。

Result: PCA与K-Means（k=4）模型获得最佳聚类质量（轮廓系数=0.4），成功识别出四种玩家原型。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可重复的分析流程，将相关性驱动的网络洞察与无监督学习相结合，不仅提高了分类准确性，还为连接游戏动机与心理福祉结果提供了整体视角。

Abstract: Profiling gamers provides critical insights for adaptive game design,
behavioral understanding, and digital well-being. This study proposes an
integrated, data-driven framework that combines psychological measures,
behavioral analytics, and machine learning to reveal underlying gamer personas.
A structured survey of 250 participants, including 113 active gamers, captured
multidimensional behavioral, motivational, and social data. The analysis
pipeline integrated feature engineering, association-network, knowledge-graph
analysis, and unsupervised clustering to extract meaningful patterns.
Correlation statistics uses Cramers V, Tschuprows T, Theils U, and Spearmans
quantified feature associations, and network centrality guided feature
selection. Dimensionality-reduction techniques such as PCA, SVD, t-SNE are
coupled with clustering algorithms like K-Means, Agglomerative, Spectral,
DBSCAN, evaluated using Silhouette, Calinski Harabasz, and Davies Bouldin
indices. The PCA with K-Means with k = 4 model achieved optimal cluster quality
with Silhouette = 0.4, identifying four archetypes as Immersive Social
Story-Seekers, Disciplined Optimizers, Strategic Systems Navigators, and
Competitive Team-Builders. This research contributes a reproducible pipeline
that links correlation-driven network insights with unsupervised learning. The
integration of behavioral correlation networks with clustering not only
enhances classification accuracy but also offers a holistic lens to connect
gameplay motivations with psychological and wellness outcomes.

*Shalaleh Rismani,Renee Shelby,Leah Davis,Negar Rostamzadeh,AJung Moon*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文分析了AI伦理评估措施的现状，发现当前措施主要关注公平性、透明度、隐私和信任四个原则，且大多评估模型或输出组件，缺乏系统层面的整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去十年中，AI伦理评估措施在碎片化方式下发展，缺乏对AI系统整体性的关注，需要研究现有措施如何映射到AI系统组件、属性和危害。

Method: 通过范围综述方法，收集了近800个与11个AI伦理原则对应的评估措施，分析这些措施与AI系统组件、属性、危害和伤害的映射关系。

Result: 研究发现大多数措施集中在四个原则，主要评估模型或输出组件，很少考虑系统元素间的交互，且每个伤害类型只考虑有限的危害集合。

Conclusion: 当前评估实践仍处于碎片化状态，需要基于系统属性、危害和伤害来构建评估框架，以加强监管监督、支持行业实践并为未来研究提供系统级理解基础。

Abstract: Over the past decade, an ecosystem of measures has emerged to evaluate the
social and ethical implications of AI systems, largely shaped by high-level
ethics principles. These measures are developed and used in fragmented ways,
without adequate attention to how they are situated in AI systems. In this
paper, we examine how existing measures used in the computing literature map to
AI system components, attributes, hazards, and harms. Our analysis draws on a
scoping review resulting in nearly 800 measures corresponding to 11 AI ethics
principles. We find that most measures focus on four principles - fairness,
transparency, privacy, and trust - and primarily assess model or output system
components. Few measures account for interactions across system elements, and
only a narrow set of hazards is typically considered for each harm type. Many
measures are disconnected from where harm is experienced and lack guidance for
setting meaningful thresholds. These patterns reveal how current evaluation
practices remain fragmented, measuring in pieces rather than capturing how
harms emerge across systems. Framing measures with respect to system
attributes, hazards, and harms can strengthen regulatory oversight, support
actionable practices in industry, and ground future research in systems-level
understanding.

TL;DR: 开发了个性化运动指导框架PMGF，使用生成式AI技术为运动员生成定制化动作改进指导，通过潜在空间操作实现动作模式的平滑过渡和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决群体层面研究结果与个体运动员个性化指导需求之间的差距，为运动员提供量身定制的动作改进方案。

Method: 使用垂直自编码器将运动序列编码为运动员特定的潜在表示，通过两种操作策略生成指导动作：1）学习者与目标动作间的平滑插值；2）在潜在空间中进行局部优化以向最优方向移动。

Result: 在51名棒球投手的验证实验中，PMGF成功生成了所有1275对投手间的平滑动作过渡，且改变的生物力学特征与已知的提升表现特征一致（如增加步幅和膝盖伸展）。

Conclusion: PMGF能够产生生物力学上合理的改进，并提出了general-PMGF扩展，将身体、环境和任务约束纳入生成过程，以增强框架在不同运动场景中的适用性。

Abstract: A critical challenge in contemporary sports science lies in filling the gap
between group-level insights derived from controlled hypothesis-driven
experiments and the real-world need for personalized coaching tailored to
individual athletes' unique movement patterns. This study developed a
Personalized Motion Guidance Framework (PMGF) to enhance athletic performance
by generating individualized motion-refinement guides using generative
artificial intelligence techniques. PMGF leverages a vertical autoencoder to
encode motion sequences into athlete-specific latent representations, which can
then be directly manipulated to generate meaningful guidance motions. Two
manipulation strategies were explored: (1) smooth interpolation between the
learner's motion and a target (e.g., expert) motion to facilitate observational
learning, and (2) shifting the motion pattern in an optimal direction in the
latent space using a local optimization technique. The results of the
validation experiment with data from 51 baseball pitchers revealed that (1)
PMGF successfully generated smooth transitions in motion patterns between
individuals across all 1,275 pitcher pairs, and (2) the features significantly
altered through PMGF manipulations reflected known performance-enhancing
characteristics, such as increased stride length and knee extension associated
with higher ball velocity, indicating that PMGF induces biomechanically
plausible improvements. We propose a future extension called general-PMGF to
enhance the applicability of this framework. This extension incorporates
bodily, environmental, and task constraints into the generation process, aiming
to provide more realistic and versatile guidance across diverse sports
contexts.

*Matan Solomon,Ofra Amir,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过对比演示来评估强化学习模型更新的效果，研究发现突出对比演示能显著提高用户识别更新是否改善性能的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习代理经常通过人类反馈进行更新，但这些更新可能不可靠（奖励错误指定、偏好冲突或数据有限），用户难以判断更新是否真正有帮助。评估模型更新（而不仅仅是单个模型）是智能用户界面的关键设计挑战。

Method: 在受控研究中，参与者向网格世界中的代理提供反馈，然后比较其原始和更新后的策略。评估了四种沟通更新策略：无演示、相同上下文、随机上下文和突出对比演示（旨在突出信息差异）。

Result: 突出对比演示显著提高了参与者检测更新是否帮助或损害性能的能力，减轻了参与者认为反馈总是有益的偏见，并支持了更好的跨上下文信任校准。

Conclusion: 评估模型更新是智能用户界面的关键设计挑战，突出对比演示是有效沟通更新效果的方法，能帮助用户更好地理解反馈的影响并校准信任。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents are often updated with human feedback, yet such
updates can be unreliable: reward misspecification, preference conflicts, or
limited data may leave policies unchanged or even worse. Because policies are
difficult to interpret directly, users face the challenge of deciding whether
an update has truly helped. We propose that assessing model updates -- not just
a single model -- is a critical design challenge for intelligent user
interfaces. In a controlled study, participants provided feedback to an agent
in a gridworld and then compared its original and updated policies. We
evaluated four strategies for communicating updates: no demonstration,
same-context, random-context, and salient-contrast demonstrations designed to
highlight informative differences. Salient-contrast demonstrations
significantly improved participants' ability to detect when updates helped or
harmed performance, mitigating participants' bias towards assuming that
feedback is always beneficial, and supported better trust calibration across
contexts.

Motivation: 现有智能手机使用控制工具需要用户主动配置参数和分析统计数据，认知负担较重，需要更轻量级的补充解决方案

Method: 利用智能手机键盘作为输出设备，在用户每次按键时通过颜色编码提供近期使用量的定性估计

Result: 开发了信息键盘概念并进行了问卷评估，证明了该方法的可行性

Conclusion: 信息键盘提供了一种有效的隐式交互方式，可以作为现有使用控制工具的补充，并具有其他应用潜力

Abstract: Excessive smartphone use is now widely considered a personal and societal
problem. It is recognized by application and smartphone makers, who provide
tools to track the amount of use, set limits, or block certain services at
predefined times. These tools, while powerful, may require significant
cognitive effort to operate: configuration parameters need to be set, and
captured statistics need to be analyzed. To offer a complementary solution, we
propose a radically different approach. We employ the keyboard of a smartphone
as an output device. With each press of a key, the user is given a high-level,
qualitative, color-encoded estimate of the amount of recent smartphone use. The
technique, dubbed the informative keyboard, is a case of implicit interaction:
the user's intention is to enter text but, while typing, they receive the
feedback. In the paper, we elaborate the concept, identify design decisions,
describe our implementation, present the outcome of a questionnaire-based
evaluation, and point to some other applications of the informative keyboard.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在心理健康领域部署大型语言模型(LLMs)时面临的隐私和安全挑战，提出了通过嵌入AI素养干预来改善用户信息披露安全性的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在心理健康领域的广泛应用，虽然提高了可访问性和个性化，但缺乏对隐私和安全问题的充分研究。用户可能在缺乏临床指导的情况下过度披露个人信息，导致隐私风险和潜在的数据滥用。

Method: 提出了一个在心理健康对话系统中直接嵌入AI素养干预的框架，并制定了评估其对披露安全性、信任和用户体验影响的研究计划。

Result: 论文识别了LLM介导治疗中信息收集、处理和存储缺乏明确结构的问题，以及用户过度披露个人信息的风险。

Conclusion: 需要在心理健康对话系统中整合AI素养干预，以平衡LLMs带来的益处与隐私安全风险，确保用户信息披露的安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mental health
contexts, from structured therapeutic support tools to informal chat-based
well-being assistants. While these systems increase accessibility, scalability,
and personalization, their integration into mental health care brings privacy
and safety challenges that have not been well-examined. Unlike traditional
clinical interactions, LLM-mediated therapy often lacks a clear structure for
what information is collected, how it is processed, and how it is stored or
reused. Users without clinical guidance may over-disclose personal information,
which is sometimes irrelevant to their presenting concern, due to misplaced
trust, lack of awareness of data risks, or the conversational design of the
system. This overexposure raises privacy concerns and also increases the
potential for LLM bias, misinterpretation, and long-term data misuse. We
propose a framework embedding Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy
interventions directly into mental health conversational systems, and outline a
study plan to evaluate their impact on disclosure safety, trust, and user
experience.

TL;DR: SusBench是一个评估LLM计算机使用代理对UI暗模式易感性的在线基准，包含313个任务，覆盖55个网站。研究发现人类和代理都对预设选择、欺骗性措辞和隐藏信息等暗模式特别易感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM计算机使用代理开始自主与现实界面交互，了解它们对操纵性界面设计的脆弱性变得至关重要。需要评估代理对UI暗模式的易感性。

Method: 从现有分类中提取9种常见暗模式类型，通过代码注入在真实消费网站上构建可信的暗模式，设计了313个评估任务。评估了5个最先进的计算机使用代理。

Result: 人类和代理都对预设选择、欺骗性措辞和隐藏信息等暗模式特别易感，但对其他明显暗模式具有抵抗力。人类参与者认为注入的暗模式高度真实，大多数未注意到是研究团队注入的。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于开发更可信的计算机使用代理，将其作为评估欺骗性设计的人类代理，并规范日益由自主代理导航的在线环境。

Abstract: As LLM-based computer-use agents (CUAs) begin to autonomously interact with
real-world interfaces, understanding their vulnerability to manipulative
interface designs becomes increasingly critical. We introduce SusBench, an
online benchmark for evaluating the susceptibility of CUAs to UI dark patterns,
designs that aim to manipulate or deceive users into taking unintentional
actions. Drawing nine common dark pattern types from existing taxonomies, we
developed a method for constructing believable dark patterns on real-world
consumer websites through code injections, and designed 313 evaluation tasks
across 55 websites. Our study with 29 participants showed that humans perceived
our dark pattern injections to be highly realistic, with the vast majority of
participants not noticing that these had been injected by the research team. We
evaluated five state-of-the-art CUAs on the benchmark. We found that both human
participants and agents are particularly susceptible to the dark patterns of
Preselection, Trick Wording, and Hidden Information, while being resilient to
other overt dark patterns. Our findings inform the development of more
trustworthy CUAs, their use as potential human proxies in evaluating deceptive
designs, and the regulation of an online environment increasingly navigated by
autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI工具在UX设计中的实际应用受到简化场景、复杂性和不可预测性以及相关教育缺乏的限制，需要解决UX设计师与AI协作中的信任问题。

Method: 通过参与式设计工作坊识别协作障碍，开发TW-AI原型模型（包含基于RAG技术的"Source"功能），并通过任务性能实验和深度访谈进行评估。

Result: TW-AI模型显著提升了从业者的信任度、工作效率、使用时机理解和可控性，"Source"功能特别增强了AI工具的可靠性，改善了沟通效率并减少了决策时间。

Conclusion: 本研究推进了UX设计师与AI协作，提供了关键见解和可操作策略，为面向UX的AI工具设计建立了指导原则，为AI驱动的UX方法学未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent years, discussions on integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into
UX design have intensified. However, the practical application of AI tools in
design is limited by their operation within overly simplified scenarios,
inherent complexity and unpredictability, and a general lack of relevant
education. This study proposes an effective UXer-AI collaboration process to
address these issues and seeks to identify efficient AI collaboration
strategies through a series of user studies. In a preliminary study, two
participatory design workshops identified major barriers to UXer-AI
collaboration, including unfamiliarity with AI, inadequate internal support,
and trust issues. To address the particularly critical issue of diminished
trust, this study developed a new AI prototype model, TW-AI, that incorporates
verification and decision-making processes to enhance trust and operational
efficiency in UX design tasks. Task performance experiments and in-depth
interviews evaluated the TW-AI model, revealing significant improvements in
practitioners' trust, work efficiency, understanding of usage timing, and
controllability. The "Source" function, based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) technology, notably enhanced the reliability of the AI tool. Participants
noted improved communication efficiency and reduced decision-making time,
attributing these outcomes to the model's comprehensive verification features
and streamlined approach to complex verification tasks. This study advances
UXer-AI collaboration by providing key insights, bridging research and practice
with actionable strategies, and establishing guidelines for AI tool designs
tailored to UX. It contributes to the HCI community by outlining a scalable
UXer-AI collaboration framework that addresses immediate operational challenges
and lays the foundation for future advancements in AI-driven UX methodologies.

Motivation: 当前AI伴侣平台缺乏针对青少年发展风险的保护措施，需要了解家长和专家如何评估这些互动以及他们认为必要的保护措施。

Method: 对26名家长和专家进行半结构化访谈，让他们审查真实的青少年与AI伴侣对话片段。

Result: 发现利益相关者根据情境评估风险，考虑青少年成熟度、AI角色年龄等因素。家长关注单次高风险事件，专家关注长期行为模式。两组提出的干预措施也不同。

Conclusion: 研究结果为将安全措施嵌入AI伴侣设计提供了方向，建议根据风险评估逻辑设计不同的保护机制。

Abstract: AI companions are increasingly popular among teenagers, yet current platforms
lack safeguards to address developmental risks and harmful normalization.
Despite growing concerns, little is known about how parents and developmental
psychology experts assess these interactions or what protections they consider
necessary. We conducted 26 semi structured interviews with parents and experts,
who reviewed real world youth GenAI companion conversation snippets. We found
that stakeholders assessed risks contextually, attending to factors such as
youth maturity, AI character age, and how AI characters modeled values and
norms. We also identified distinct logics of assessment: parents flagged single
events, such as a mention of suicide or flirtation, as high risk, whereas
experts looked for patterns over time, such as repeated references to self harm
or sustained dependence. Both groups proposed interventions, with parents
favoring broader oversight and experts preferring cautious, crisis-only
escalation paired with youth facing safeguards. These findings provide
directions for embedding safety into AI companion design.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于代理的方法，使用配备工具和OPC UA通信标准的大语言模型，通过自然语言控制机器，取代触摸交互，实现人与机器更自然的交互界面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工业操作中主要使用触摸交互，但这种方式不够自然。论文旨在通过自然语言交互提升人机界面的自然性和易用性。

Method: 利用大语言模型接收用户自然语言输入，选择三个预定义工具之一连接OPC UA服务器，修改或读取节点值，然后将执行结果返回给语言模型生成最终响应。

Result: 在西门子S7-1500 PLC上的评估显示，专有GPT 5模型准确率达到96.0%-98.0%，开源模型最高达到90.0%，成功率很高。

Conclusion: 该方法无需微调或训练数据，只需机器凭证和参数字典，可应用于任何支持OPC UA标准的机器，推动了工业人机界面自然交互的发展。

Abstract: This paper proposes an agent-based approach toward a more natural interface
between humans and machines. Large language models equipped with tools and the
communication standard OPC UA are utilized to control machines in natural
language. Instead of touch interaction, which is currently the state-of-the-art
medium for interaction in operations, the proposed approach enables operators
to talk or text with machines. This allows commands such as 'Please decrease
the temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and set the motor speed to 5000 rpm in
machine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of
three predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or
read the value of a node. Afterwards, the result of the tool execution is
passed back to the language model, which then provides a final response to the
user. The approach is universally designed and can therefore be applied to any
machine that supports the OPC UA standard. The large language model is neither
fine-tuned nor requires training data, only the relevant machine credentials
and a parameter dictionary are included within the system prompt. The approach
is evaluated on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller with four
machine parameters in a case study of fifty synthetically generated commands on
five different models. The results demonstrate high success rate, with
proprietary GPT 5 models achieving accuracies between 96.0 % and 98.0 %, and
open-weight models reaching up to 90.0 %. The proposed approach of this
empirical study contributes to advancing natural interaction in industrial
human-machine interfaces.

Abstract: This paper proposes a rigorous framework to examine the two-way relationship
between artificial intelligence (AI), human cognition, problem-solving, and
cultural adaptation across academic and business settings. It addresses a key
gap by asking how AI reshapes cognitive processes and organizational norms, and
how cultural values and institutional contexts shape AI adoption, trust, and
use over time. We employ a three-wave longitudinal design that tracks AI
knowledge, perceived competence, trust trajectories, and cultural responses.
Participants span academic institutions and diverse firms, enabling contextual
comparison. A dynamic sample continuous, intermittent, and wave-specific
respondents mirrors real organizational variability and strengthens ecological
validity. Methodologically, the study integrates quantitative longitudinal
modeling with qualitative thematic analysis to capture temporal, structural,
and cultural patterns in AI uptake. We trace AI acculturation through phases of
initial resistance, exploratory adoption, and cultural embedding, revealing
distinctive trust curves and problem-solving strategies by context: academic
environments tend to collaborative, deliberative integration; business
environments prioritize performance, speed, and measurable outcomes. Framing
adoption as bidirectional challenges deterministic views: AI both reflects and
reconfigures norms, decision-making, and cognitive engagement. As the first
comparative longitudinal study of its kind, this work advances methodological
rigor and offers actionable foundations for human-centred, culturally
responsive AI strategies-supporting evidence-based policies, training, and
governance that align cognitive performance, organizational goals, and ethical
commitments.

*Hoang-Son Vo,Karina Kolmogortseva,Ngumimi Karen Iyortsuun,Hong-Duyen Vo,Soo-Hyung Kim*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: GlobalizeEds通过配音格式显著降低认知负荷，提供更沉浸式学习体验，同时保持说话者声音以增强真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大量学术内容仅以原始语言提供，为全球学生群体设置了访问障碍，特别是在历史、文化和艺术等需要适当教学语调和专业意义的学科中。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，涉及36名参与者，比较传统字幕与GlobalizeEds配音格式的效果。

Result: 配音格式显著降低认知负荷，提供更沉浸式体验；学习效果在高质量字幕和配音格式间相当，但两组都重视说话者声音的保留；教师关注翻译准确性和声音自然度，学生重视同步、身份保持的输出。

Conclusion: 提出了以人为中心的多模态翻译系统框架，平衡语言保真度、文化适应性和用户控制，创造更具包容性的全球学习体验。

Abstract: A large amount of valuable academic content is only available in its original
language, creating a significant access barrier for the global student
community. This is a challenge for translating in several subjects, such as
history, culture, and the arts, where current automated subtitle tools fail to
convey the appropriate pedagogical tone and specialized meaning. In addition,
reading traditional automated subtitles increases cognitive load and leads to a
disconnected learning experience. Through a mixed-methods study involving 36
participants, we found that GlobalizeEds dubbed formats significantly reduce
cognitive load and offer a more immersive learning experience compared to
traditional subtitles. Although learning effectiveness was comparable between
high-quality subtitles and dubbed formats, both groups valued GlobalizeEds
ability to preserve the speakers voice, which enhanced perceived authenticity.
Instructors rated translation accuracy and vocal naturalness, whereas students
reported that synchronized, identity-preserving outputs fostered engagement and
trust. This work contributes a novel human-centered AI framework for
cross-lingual education, demonstrating how multimodal translation systems can
balance linguistic fidelity, cultural adaptability, and user control to create
more inclusive global learning experiences.

TL;DR: 提出CFG-DP框架，通过集成无分类器引导与条件/无条件模型来增强扩散策略，解决时序任务中的局部最优和重复动作问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散策略和动作分块变换器方法缺乏时序上下文，导致局部最优陷阱和过多重复动作，难以处理时序顺序任务。

Method: 使用无分类器引导结合时间步输入来跟踪任务进度，动态调整动作预测，通过调节引导因子平衡时序一致性和动作精度。

Result: 在人形机器人上的真实实验显示高成功率、最少重复动作，并能有效终止动作，不同组件和参数调整对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了时序机器人任务的确定性控制和执行可靠性。

Abstract: Temporal sequential tasks challenge humanoid robots, as existing Diffusion
Policy (DP) and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) methods often lack
temporal context, resulting in local optima traps and excessive repetitive
actions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Classifier-Free
Guidance-Based Diffusion Policy (CFG-DP), a novel framework to enhance DP by
integrating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with conditional and unconditional
models. Specifically, CFG leverages timestep inputs to track task progression
and ensure precise cycle termination. It dynamically adjusts action predictions
based on task phase, using a guidance factor tuned to balance temporal
coherence and action accuracy. Real-world experiments on a humanoid robot
demonstrate high success rates and minimal repetitive actions. Furthermore, we
assessed the model's ability to terminate actions and examined how different
components and parameter adjustments affect its performance. This framework
significantly enhances deterministic control and execution reliability for
sequential robotic tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了两种跨传感器触觉图像生成方法：Touch2Touch（端到端）和T2D2（通过深度表示），用于解决不同触觉传感器间的模型迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前触觉传感器形状和尺寸各异，导致难以开发通用触觉表示，因为大多数模型都绑定到特定传感器设计。

Method: 1. Touch2Touch：端到端方法，利用配对数据；2. T2D2：构建中间深度表示，无需配对数据。两种方法都通过跨传感器触觉生成过程实现传感器特定模型的跨传感器使用。

Result: 在手持姿态估计和行为克隆等下游任务中验证了有效性，成功将在一个传感器上训练的模型迁移到另一个传感器。

Conclusion: 这些模型为传感器转换提供了灵活的解决方案，可根据数据可用性和应用需求选择合适的方法。

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it
challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because
most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we
propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an
end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method
builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data
(T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific
models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process.
Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation,
depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their
effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior
cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

Motivation: 在机器人重复遍历同一环境时，及时更新地图中的变化区域至关重要。现有3DGS方法在准确高效更新变化区域方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出混合表示方法，将3DGS与基于TSDF的体素地图结合来识别变化区域，并采用变化感知密度控制策略来插入或删除高斯基元。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在半静态场景中显著提高了渲染质量和地图更新效率。

Conclusion: VG-Mapping为半静态场景的在线建图提供了有效的解决方案，并发布了相关数据集和代码。

Abstract: Maintaining an up-to-date map that accurately reflects recent changes in the
environment is crucial, especially for robots that repeatedly traverse the same
space. Failing to promptly update the changed regions can degrade map quality,
resulting in poor localization, inefficient operations, and even lost robots.
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently seen widespread adoption in online
map reconstruction due to its dense, differentiable, and photorealistic
properties, yet accurately and efficiently updating the regions of change
remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose VG-Mapping, a novel online
3DGS-based mapping system tailored for such semi-static scenes. Our approach
introduces a hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with a TSDF-based voxel
map to efficiently identify changed regions in a scene, along with a
variation-aware density control strategy that inserts or deletes Gaussian
primitives in regions undergoing change. Furthermore, to address the absence of
public benchmarks for this task, we construct a RGB-D dataset comprising both
synthetic and real-world semi-static environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method substantially improves the rendering quality and
map update efficiency in semi-static scenes. The code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/heyicheng-never/VG-Mapping.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型自动构建行为树的异构多机器人系统框架，通过动态生成和扩展行为树来解决动态环境中的适应性和鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人受限于固定功能属性，无法在任务失败或环境变化时高效重新配置策略，需要一种能够动态适应和协作的解决方案。

Method: 框架包含四个互联模块：任务初始化、任务分配、行为树更新和失败节点检测。机器人执行时tick行为树，遇到失败节点时可本地扩展树或调用集中式虚拟协调器重新分配子任务。

Result: 在3个模拟场景的60个任务和真实世界咖啡厅环境中验证，结果显示在任务成功率、鲁棒性和可扩展性方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持异构多机器人在复杂场景中的长期协作执行，证明了LLM与行为树结合在多机器人协作中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for automatic behavior tree (BT) construction
in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, designed to address the challenges of
adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. Traditional robots are
limited by fixed functional attributes and cannot efficiently reconfigure their
strategies in response to task failures or environmental changes. To overcome
this limitation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate and
extend BTs dynamically, combining the reasoning and generalization power of
LLMs with the modularity and recovery capability of BTs. The proposed framework
consists of four interconnected modules task initialization, task assignment,
BT update, and failure node detection which operate in a closed loop. Robots
tick their BTs during execution, and upon encountering a failure node, they can
either extend the tree locally or invoke a centralized virtual coordinator
(Alex) to reassign subtasks and synchronize BTs across peers. This design
enables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous teams. We validate the
framework on 60 tasks across three simulated scenarios and in a real-world cafe
environment with a robotic arm and a wheeled-legged robot. Results show that
our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in task success rate,
robustness, and scalability, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-robot
collaboration in complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FORM的LiDAR里程计方法，通过密集连接的因子图进行平滑处理，同时使用单一迭代地图进行匹配，实现实时性能和局部地图的主动校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LiDAR里程计方法大多基于子地图，会将姿态估计误差传播到固定子地图中，导致轨迹抖动和未来配准性能下降。需要一种既能实时运行又能主动校正局部地图的方法。

Method: 使用固定滞后平滑方法，在密集连接的因子图上进行平滑处理，同时维护单一迭代地图用于匹配，允许在姿态估计进一步优化时主动校正局部地图。

Result: 在多种数据集上的评估表明，FORM方法相比现有最先进的LiDAR里程计方法具有更好的鲁棒性、准确性、实时性，并能提供更平滑的轨迹估计。

Conclusion: FORM方法成功解决了传统子地图方法中的误差传播问题，实现了实时性能与地图校正能力的平衡，在LiDAR里程计任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become a de-facto sensor for
many robot state estimation tasks, spurring development of many LiDAR Odometry
(LO) methods in recent years. While some smoothing-based LO methods have been
proposed, most require matching against multiple scans, resulting in
sub-real-time performance. Due to this, most prior works estimate a single
state at a time and are ``submap''-based. This architecture propagates any
error in pose estimation to the fixed submap and can cause jittery trajectories
and degrade future registrations. We propose Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative
Mapping (FORM), a LO method that performs smoothing over a densely connected
factor graph while utilizing a single iterative map for matching. This allows
for both real-time performance and active correction of the local map as pose
estimates are further refined. We evaluate on a wide variety of datasets to
show that FORM is robust, accurate, real-time, and provides smooth trajectory
estimates when compared to prior state-of-the-art LO methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮腿机器人结合了腿式运动的灵活性和轮式运动的高效性，但其全身控制仍然具有挑战性，需要智能协调轮子和腿部的运动

Method: 使用强化学习构建预测策略网络来估计外部环境状态，然后通过actor-critic网络生成最优关节指令，无需预定义步态模式

Result: 在多种地形（平地、楼梯、草地）的仿真和真实实验中验证了框架的可行性，在未见过的地形上表现出鲁棒性能和泛化能力

Conclusion: ATRos框架能够有效实现轮腿机器人的混合运动，提高了地形适应性和能量效率

Abstract: Hybrid locomotion of wheeled-legged robots has recently attracted increasing
attention due to their advantages of combining the agility of legged locomotion
and the efficiency of wheeled motion. But along with expanded performance, the
whole-body control of wheeled-legged robots remains challenging for hybrid
locomotion. In this paper, we present ATRos, a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based hybrid locomotion framework to achieve hybrid walking-driving
motions on the wheeled-legged robot. Without giving predefined gait patterns,
our planner aims to intelligently coordinate simultaneous wheel and leg
movements, thereby achieving improved terrain adaptability and improved energy
efficiency. Based on RL techniques, our approach constructs a prediction policy
network that could estimate external environmental states from proprioceptive
sensory information, and the outputs are then fed into an actor critic network
to produce optimal joint commands. The feasibility of the proposed framework is
validated through both simulations and real-world experiments across diverse
terrains, including flat ground, stairs, and grassy surfaces. The hybrid
locomotion framework shows robust performance over various unseen terrains,
highlighting its generalization capability.

Conclusion: 研究为软硬混合夹持器设计提供了新见解，推进了精准农业自动化策略，同时最小化作物损伤。

Abstract: The agricultural sector is rapidly evolving to meet growing global food
demands, yet tasks like fruit and vegetable handling remain labor-intensive,
causing inefficiencies and post-harvest losses. Automation, particularly
selective harvesting, offers a viable solution, with soft robotics emerging as
a key enabler. This study introduces a novel hybrid gripper for tomato
harvesting, incorporating a rigid outer frame with a soft auxetic internal
lattice. The six-finger, 3D caging-effect design enables gentle yet secure
grasping in unstructured environments. Uniquely, the work investigates the
effect of auxetic lattice orientation on grasping conformability, combining
experimental validation with 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and nonlinear
finite element analysis (FEA). Auxetic configurations with unit cell
inclinations of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg, and 60 deg are evaluated, and their
grasping forces, deformation responses, and motor torque requirements are
systematically compared. Results demonstrate that lattice orientation strongly
influences compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency, with distinct
advantages across configurations. This comparative framework highlights the
novelty of tailoring auxetic geometries to optimize robotic gripper
performance. The findings provide new insights into soft-rigid hybrid gripper
design, advancing automation strategies for precision agriculture while
minimizing crop damage.

<details>

Motivation: 现有单人形机器人方法存在隔离问题，忽略了代理间动态，导致接触错位、相互穿透和不真实的运动。需要解决多人形机器人之间物理接地、社会意义的全身交互问题。

Method: 包含两个关键组件：(1) 接触感知运动重定向，通过将SMPL接触与机器人顶点对齐来恢复身体间协调；(2) 交互驱动运动控制器，利用交互特定奖励来强制协调关键点和物理上合理的接触。

Result: 实验证明Harmanoid显著改善了交互运动模仿，超越了在类似场景中基本失败的现有单人形框架。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模代理间接触和交互感知动态，Harmanoid捕捉了单人形框架固有忽略的人形机器人之间的耦合行为。

Abstract: The true promise of humanoid robotics lies beyond single-agent autonomy: two
or more humanoids must engage in physically grounded, socially meaningful
whole-body interactions that echo the richness of human social interaction.
However, single-humanoid methods suffer from the isolation issue, ignoring
inter-agent dynamics and causing misaligned contacts, interpenetrations, and
unrealistic motions. To address this, we present Harmanoid , a dual-humanoid
motion imitation framework that transfers interacting human motions to two
robots while preserving both kinematic fidelity and physical realism. Harmanoid
comprises two key components: (i) contact-aware motion retargeting, which
restores inter-body coordination by aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices,
and (ii) interaction-driven motion controller, which leverages
interaction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and physically
plausible contacts. By explicitly modeling inter-agent contacts and
interaction-aware dynamics, Harmanoid captures the coupled behaviors between
humanoids that single-humanoid frameworks inherently overlook. Experiments
demonstrate that Harmanoid significantly improves interactive motion imitation,
surpassing existing single-humanoid frameworks that largely fail in such
scenarios.

TL;DR: LOMORO是一个在线多机器人协作目标监控系统，通过资源感知的任务协调和在线适应算法，确保目标监控间隔上限和机器人资源下限，同时最小化活跃机器人数量。


<details>

Motivation: 长期监控多个动态目标对人类操作员来说很繁琐，单个机器人也难以完成。现有方法往往部署所有可用机器人而不最小化规模，或忽略电池和内存等资源约束。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：(I) 资源约束和监控间隔下的多机器人任务分配建模；(II) 资源感知任务协调算法，通过Martin算法在高层动态目标分配和低层多目标路由间迭代；(III) 针对不可预测目标行为和机器人故障的在线适应算法。

Result: 通过大规模仿真验证，在不同道路网络、机器人速度、充电速率和监控间隔下，相比多个基线方法表现优异。

Conclusion: LOMORO系统能够有效确保所有目标的监控间隔上限和所有机器人的资源下限，同时最小化平均活跃机器人数量，解决了多机器人协作监控中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Long-term monitoring of numerous dynamic targets can be tedious for a human
operator and infeasible for a single robot, e.g., to monitor wild flocks,
detect intruders, search and rescue. Fleets of autonomous robots can be
effective by acting collaboratively and concurrently. However, the online
coordination is challenging due to the unknown behaviors of the targets and the
limited perception of each robot. Existing work often deploys all robots
available without minimizing the fleet size, or neglects the constraints on
their resources such as battery and memory. This work proposes an online
coordination scheme called LOMORO for collaborative target monitoring, path
routing and resource charging. It includes three core components: (I) the
modeling of multi-robot task assignment problem under the constraints on
resources and monitoring intervals; (II) the resource-aware task coordination
algorithm iterates between the high-level assignment of dynamic targets and the
low-level multi-objective routing via the Martin's algorithm; (III) the online
adaptation algorithm in case of unpredictable target behaviors and robot
failures. It ensures the explicitly upper-bounded monitoring intervals for all
targets and the lower-bounded resource levels for all robots, while minimizing
the average number of active robots. The proposed methods are validated
extensively via large-scale simulations against several baselines, under
different road networks, robot velocities, charging rates and monitoring
intervals.

lowers the barrier to building scalable multi-robot systems. The code can be

Motivation: 月球GNSS导航中未建模的电离层和等离子体层延迟是主要误差源，需要系统分析其对定位精度的影响。

Method: 使用全球核心等离子体模型(GCPM)和低成本射线追踪算法，模拟GNSS信号在月球轨道和南极接收时的群延迟和路径弯曲延迟。

Result: 平均群延迟约1米，但在高太阳活动期间低高度射线路径可超过100米；弯曲延迟较小但对低高度路径不可忽略。

Conclusion: 电离层和等离子体层延迟对月球GNSS导航有显著影响，特别是在高太阳活动条件下，这些发现有助于设计更稳健的定位和定时算法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) have
demonstrated that terrestrial GNSS signals, including weak sidelobe
transmissions, can be exploited for lunar spacecraft positioning and timing.
While GNSS-based navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled
ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source,
particularly given the unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths.
This paper characterizes these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM)
and a custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm that iteratively solves for bent
signal paths. We simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays, as
well as excess path length from ray bending, for GNSS signals received at both
lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying solar and geomagnetic
conditions. Results show that mean group delays are typically on the order of 1
m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high solar activity,
while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude
ray paths. We also quantify the influence of signal frequency, geomagnetic
$K_p$ index, and solar R12 index. These findings inform the design of robust
positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自动驾驶预测模型测试框架，通过考虑场景结构、地图上下文、智能体密度和空间分布等因素，弥补了传统指标（如ADE和FDE）在复杂交互场景下的评估不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶预测模型的评估方法过于依赖简单的ADE和FDE指标，无法捕捉复杂交互和安全关键场景下的细微行为差异，特别是无法区分附近与远处智能体的影响，也缺乏对多智能体交互鲁棒性的系统测试。

Method: 设计了一个新颖的测试框架，在多样化的场景结构下评估预测性能，包括地图上下文、智能体密度和空间分布等因素，通过实证分析量化智能体邻近度对目标轨迹预测的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为严格的安全驱动预测验证奠定了基础，有助于识别易发生故障的极端情况，并为开发鲁棒、可认证的自动驾驶预测系统做出重要贡献。

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely
heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and
Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance
assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules
under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For
instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus
distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying
multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a
novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse
scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution.
Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of
agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific
failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings
highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and
demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework
lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation,
contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases
and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous
vehicles.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-layer Voronoi coverage control approach for
coordinating hybrid aerial-ground robot teams in hazardous material emergency

critical limitations in emergency contexts: heterogeneous agent capabilities
with vastly different velocities, clustered initial deployment configurations,
and urgent time constraints requiring rapid response rather than eventual
convergence. Our method addresses these challenges through a decoupled
two-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot
positioning, with aerial agents delivering ground sensors via airdrop to
high-priority locations. We provide detailed implementation of bounded Voronoi
cell computation, efficient numerical integration techniques for
importance-weighted centroids, and robust control strategies that prevent agent
trapping. Simulation results demonstrate an 88% reduction in response time,
achieving target sensor coverage (18.5% of initial sensor loss) in 25 seconds
compared to 220 seconds for ground-only deployment. Complete implementation

Conclusion: 可控多视角世界模型为通用机器人策略的评估和改进提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，显著减少了真实世界部署的需求，同时有效提升了策略性能。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies can now perform a wide range of manipulation
skills, but evaluating and improving their ability with unfamiliar objects and
instructions remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation requires a
large number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands
additional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are
slow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable
alternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,
a key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle
multi-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world
model compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view
prediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon
interactions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a
step forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be
used to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist
robot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a
pose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control
through frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k
trajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally
consistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for
over 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance
without real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful
trajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our
approach can improve policy success by 44.7\%.

*LinFeng Li,Jian Zhao,Yuan Xie,Xin Tan,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出从路径模仿转向决策理解的新范式，通过Compass-Data-22k数据集和gap-aware混合奖励函数，训练LVLMs发展内部"指南针"来导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于专家轨迹模仿的LVLMs训练方法将复杂导航任务简化为序列复制，限制了智能体的探索和泛化能力。

Method: 引入22k轨迹数据集Compass-Data-22k，其RFT子集标注所有可行动作的A*测地距离；设计gap-aware混合奖励函数，根据决策确定性动态调整反馈；采用SFT-then-RFT训练方法。

Result: 7B智能体在目标导航基准测试中达到新SOTA，超越更大专有模型，并在物理机器人上实现鲁棒的真实世界目标导航。

Conclusion: 决策理解范式使智能体不再记忆静态路线，而是发展内部指南针，通过评估所有可能移动的相对质量来持续推断目标方向。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
navigation relies on imitating expert trajectories. This approach reduces the
complex navigation task to a sequence-to-sequence replication of a single
correct path, fundamentally limiting the agent's ability to explore and
generalize. In this work, we argue for and introduce a new paradigm: a shift
from Path Imitation to Decision Understanding. The goal of this paradigm is to
build agents that do not just follow, but truly understand how to navigate. We
materialize this through two core contributions: first, we introduce
Compass-Data-22k, a novel 22k-trajectory dataset.Its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT) subset provides a panoramic view of the decision landscape by annotating
all feasible actions with A* geodesic distances. Second, we design a novel
gap-aware hybrid reward function that dynamically adapts its feedback to
decision certainty, shifting between decisive signals for optimal actions and
nuanced scores to encourage exploration. Integrated into an SFT-then-RFT
recipe, our CompassNav agent is trained not to memorize static routes, but to
develop an internal ``compass'' that constantly intuits the direction to the
goal by evaluating the relative quality of all possible moves. This approach
enables our 7B agent to set a new state-of-the-art on Goal navigation
benchmarks, outperforming even larger proprietary models, and achieve robust
real-world goal navigation on a physical robot.

Conclusion: 分层多智能体强化学习框架能有效解决复杂空战环境中的决策挑战，提升智能体的作战能力。

Abstract: Achieving mission objectives in a realistic simulation of aerial combat is
highly challenging due to imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight
dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D multi-agent air combat
environment and a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework to
tackle these challenges. Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics,
curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To
this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels:
low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies
issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show
that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat
performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

Result: 在多样化具身任务实验中，EFN显著提升了适应性、鲁棒性和成功率，优于冻结基线模型。

Conclusion: Dejavu框架为实现部署后持续优化行为的具身智能体提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了不确定性驱动的前瞻循环神经网络（UF-RNN），通过前瞻模块进行内部多轨迹模拟，在不确定性高时选择性地探索动作，在门开启任务中表现出比传统随机RNN更强的鲁棒适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在不确定状态环境（如模糊物体属性或不可预测交互）中有效操作的挑战，传统模仿学习方法依赖成功示例而忽略不确定性最显著失败场景的局限性。

Method: UF-RNN模型结合标准时间序列预测与主动"前瞻"模块，该模块执行多个未来轨迹的内部模拟，并通过最小化预测方差来优化隐藏状态。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人门开启任务中评估，尽管没有明确失败演示，模型通过利用潜在空间中的自诱导混沌动力学表现出鲁棒适应性，相比传统随机RNN基线提高了成功率。

Conclusion: 将不确定性驱动的前瞻整合到模仿学习流程中，可以显著增强机器人处理不可预测现实条件的能力。

Abstract: Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states,
such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a
longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely
on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is
most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven
Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard
time-series prediction with an active "Foresight" module. This module performs
internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden
state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore
actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in
both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the
absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust
adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space.
When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate
exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding
improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These
findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation
learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle
unpredictable real-world conditions.

Motivation: 理解结构化、类人注意力行为如何通过自上而下和自下而上机制的相互适应随时间演化，探究感知与内部预测交互在注意力自组织中的重要性。

Method: 提出A³RNN注意力模型，采用双向注意力架构整合预测性TD信号和基于显著性的BU线索，在机器人操作任务中使用模仿学习进行评估。

Result: 注意力行为在训练过程中从显著性驱动探索演变为预测驱动定向。BU注意力初始突出显著区域引导TD过程，随着学习进展，TD注意力稳定并重塑显著性感知。

Conclusion: 模型展现出比基线更连贯和可解释的注意力模式，支持发展机制有助于稳健注意力形成的观点，反映了认知科学和自由能框架的原则。

Abstract: This study investigates the developmental interaction between top-down (TD)
and bottom-up (BU) visual attention in robotic learning. Our goal is to
understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the
mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a
novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and
saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture.
  We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.
Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training,
from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU
attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while
as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is
perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive
science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of
self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal
prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits
more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting
the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention
formation.

Abstract: Efficient physics simulation has significantly accelerated research progress
in robotics applications such as grasping and assembly. The advent of
GPU-accelerated simulation frameworks like Isaac Sim has particularly empowered
learning-based methods, enabling them to tackle increasingly complex tasks. The
PAL Robotics TIAGo++ Omni is a versatile mobile manipulator equipped with a
mecanum-wheeled base, allowing omnidirectional movement and a wide range of
task capabilities. However, until now, no model of the robot has been available
in Isaac Sim. In this paper, we introduce such a model, calibrated to
approximate the behavior of the real robot, with a focus on its omnidirectional
drive dynamics. We present two control models for the omnidirectional drive: a
physically accurate model that replicates real-world wheel dynamics and a
lightweight velocity-based model optimized for learning-based applications.
With these models, we introduce a learning-based calibration approach to
approximate the real robot's S-shaped velocity profile using minimal trajectory
data recordings. This simulation should allow researchers to experiment with
the robot and perform efficient learning-based control in diverse environments.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective
training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment,
heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,
diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with
minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into
cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable
embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as
embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective
exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat
flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted
standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.
Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B

Abstract: Chemistry, a long-standing discipline, has historically relied on manual and
often time-consuming processes. While some automation exists, the field is now
on the cusp of a significant evolution driven by the integration of robotics
and artificial intelligence (AI), giving rise to the concept of the
robochemist: a new paradigm where autonomous systems assist in designing,
executing, and analyzing experiments. Robochemists integrate mobile
manipulators, advanced perception, teleoperation, and data-driven protocols to
execute experiments with greater adaptability, reproducibility, and safety.
Rather than a fully automated replacement for human chemists, we envisioned the
robochemist as a complementary partner that works collaboratively to enhance
discovery, enabling a more efficient exploration of chemical space and
accelerating innovation in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and sustainable
manufacturing. This article traces the technologies, applications, and
challenges that define this transformation, highlighting both the opportunities
and the responsibilities that accompany the emergence of the robochemist.
Ultimately, the future of chemistry is argued to lie in a symbiotic partnership
where human intuition and expertise is amplified by robotic precision and
AI-driven insight.

Conclusion: sqrtVINS在各种场景下验证了强大的效率、鲁棒性和可靠性，开源实现支持未来研究和应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and open-source, for the first time, a square-root
filter (SRF)-based visual-inertial navigation system (VINS), termed sqrtVINS,
which is ultra-fast, numerically stable, and capable of dynamic initialization
even under extreme conditions (i.e., extremely small time window). Despite
recent advancements in VINS, resource constraints and numerical instability on
embedded (robotic) systems with limited precision remain critical challenges. A
square-root covariance-based filter offers a promising solution by providing
numerical stability, efficient memory usage, and guaranteed positive
semi-definiteness. However, canonical SRFs suffer from inefficiencies caused by
disruptions in the triangular structure of the covariance matrix during
updates. The proposed method significantly improves VINS efficiency with a
novel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based SRF update, by fully exploiting the
system structure to preserve the structure. Moreover, we design a fast, robust,
dynamic initialization method, which first recovers the minimal states without
triangulating 3D features and then efficiently performs iterative SRF update to
refine the full states, enabling seamless VINS operation. The proposed
LLT-based SRF is extensively verified through numerical studies, demonstrating
superior numerical stability and achieving robust efficient performance on
32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our initialization method, tested on both
mobile workstations and Jetson Nano computers, achieving a high success rate of
initialization even within a 100 ms window under minimal conditions. Finally,
the proposed sqrtVINS is extensively validated across diverse scenarios,
demonstrating strong efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The full
open-source implementation is released to support future research and
applications.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently
gained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,
the focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective
of its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to
accurately "throw-flip" objects to a desired landing pose (position and
orientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from
parasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing
poses. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the
impulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that
effectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the
feasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free
flight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.
Real robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip
objects to a pose target within ($\pm$5 cm, $\pm$45 degrees) threshold in
dozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile
dynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to
unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show
that past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,
accelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass
(CoM) shift. A video summarizing the proposed method and the hardware
experiments is available at https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU.

targets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them
progressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage
uncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing
track of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing
approaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded
environments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in
large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for
tracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the
challenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models
and uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed
decision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of
single target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel
low-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving
belief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for
each sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to
a Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to
determine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation,
demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target
tracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches,
achieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different
environments.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating
specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous
variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for
each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for
generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries
and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a
symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal,
morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved
symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for
predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion
patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented
on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a
range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving
gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement
control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and
underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.

Abstract: Galilean symmetry is the natural symmetry of inertial motion that underpins
Newtonian physics. Although rigid-body symmetry is one of the most established
and fundamental tools in robotics, there appears to be no comparable treatment
of Galilean symmetry for a robotics audience. In this paper, we present a
robotics-tailored exposition of Galilean symmetry that leverages the
community's familiarity with and understanding of rigid-body transformations
and pose representations. Our approach contrasts with common treatments in the
physics literature that introduce Galilean symmetry as a stepping stone to
Einstein's relativity. A key insight is that the Galilean matrix Lie group can
be used to describe two different pose representations, Galilean frames, that
use inertial velocity in the state definition, and extended poses, that use
coordinate velocity. We provide three examples where applying the Galilean
matrix Lie-group algebra to robotics problems is straightforward and yields
significant insights: inertial navigation above the rotating Earth, manipulator
kinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty. We believe that
the time is right for the robotics community to benefit from rediscovering and
extending this classical material and applying it to modern problems.

TL;DR: SuperEx框架将非视距(NLOS)感知集成到机器人探索中，使用单光子LiDAR通过飞行时间直方图探测隐藏物体，实现绕过盲区的探索和建图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人感知局限于视距范围，被遮挡区域需要物理遍历才能发现，导致探索效率低下。非视距感知能让机器人探测盲区后的物体。

Method: SuperEx框架通过(i)从时序直方图中剔除空NLOS区域，(ii)利用结构规律性通过物理和数据驱动方法重建占据结构，将NLOS感知直接集成到建图-探索循环中。

Result: 在复杂模拟地图和真实KTH Floorplan数据集上的评估显示，在<30%覆盖率下建图精度提升12%，探索效率相比视距基线有所提高。

Conclusion: 该工作为实现超越直接可见性的可靠建图开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a
fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current
systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions
remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration
when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage
single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the
presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners.
Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling
deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D
reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward
NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a
framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration
loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by
(i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing
occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that
leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and
the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under
< 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight
baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

Conclusion: 群体编码SNNs是资源受限应用中能效高、性能好的机器人控制的有前景解决方案，为实际机器人系统的可扩展部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Energy-efficient and high-performance motor control remains a critical
challenge in robotics, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control
tasks with limited onboard resources. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
has achieved remarkable results, its computational demands and energy
consumption limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the
event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy
optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency
and control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded
Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations
into neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through
gradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using
the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental
results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy
savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN
policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from
commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during
pick-and-place operations. These results position population-coded SNNs as a
promising solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in
resource-constrained applications, paving the way for scalable deployment in
real-world robotics systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的4通道双边控制方法在笛卡尔坐标系中有效实现了维度解耦和期望动力学，为远程控制提供了改进的操作性

Abstract: Four-channel bilateral control is a method for achieving remote control with
force feedback and adjustment operability by synchronizing the positions and
forces of two manipulators. This is expected to significantly improve the
operability of the remote control in contact-rich tasks. Among these, 4-channel
bilateral control on the Cartesian coordinate system is advantageous owing to
its suitability for manipulators with different structures and because it
allows the dynamics in the Cartesian coordinate system to be adjusted by
adjusting the control parameters, thus achieving intuitive operability for
humans. This paper proposes a 4-channel bilateral control method that achieves
the desired dynamics by decoupling each dimension in the Cartesian coordinate
system regardless of the scaling factor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于采样的轨迹规划器使用手动调优的静态权重成本函数，无法适应各种复杂场景，需要在安全性（避免碰撞）和竞争力（快速超车）之间做出妥协。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL）智能体作为高层行为选择器，在运行时动态切换分析性底层轨迹规划器的成本函数参数，实现自适应行为切换。

Result: 在自动驾驶赛车模拟环境中，RL规划器实现了0%碰撞率，同时将超车时间减少高达60%，相比静态规划器能够实现更具交互性的机动动作。

Conclusion: 将强化学习作为高层选择器集成解决了自动驾驶赛车规划器中安全性与竞争力之间的固有权衡，为更广泛的自动驾驶应用提供了自适应且可解释的运动规划路径。

Abstract: Sampling-based trajectory planners are widely used for agile autonomous
driving due to their ability to generate fast, smooth, and kinodynamically
feasible trajectories. However, their behavior is often governed by a cost
function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical
compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in
a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the
cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during
runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an
autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision
rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art
static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and
conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static
configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement
learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between
safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed
methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning
for broader autonomous driving applications.

We detail the operating principles and performance characteristics of SPAD

challenges of upcoming exploration missions to the Moon, and benchmark their
performance under representative illumination conditions.

cross-platform mobile interface with MQTT-based control signaling and WebRTC
video streaming via the LiveKit framework. A YOLOv11-nano model is deployed for
lightweight object detection, enabling real-time perception with annotated

transmitted via MQTT to an ESP8266-based actuator node, which coordinates
multi-axis robotic arm motion through an Arduino Mega2560 controller. The

total video latency under 1.2 seconds, even across high-latency networks. This
low-latency dual-protocol design ensures responsive closed-loop interaction and
robust performance in distributed environments. Unlike conventional

real-time AI sensing, and adaptable communication strategies, making it
well-suited for smart city scenarios such as remote infrastructure inspection,

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D
point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological
intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired
paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that
mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events
from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses.
Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural
network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp
hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this
approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show
that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially
in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data
efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired
approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and
efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

Abstract: The scalability of robotic learning is fundamentally bottlenecked by the
significant cost and labor of real-world data collection. While simulated data
offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world
due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object
interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real
framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable,
high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic
manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation:
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the
environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate
physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible,
articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical
properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures
(e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained
entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and
generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as
a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in
open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage
knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built
generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models
(VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from
vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation
pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of
generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both
comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that
robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of
understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building
on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically
model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M
internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is
fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning
of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive
experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world
out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: A new AUV mission planning and execution software has been tested on AUV
Sentry. Dubbed DINOS-R, it draws inspiration from cognitive architectures and
AUV control systems to replace the legacy MC architecture. Unlike these
existing architectures, however, DINOS-R is built from the ground-up to unify
symbolic decision making (for understandable, repeatable, provable behavior)
with machine learning techniques and reactive behaviors, for field-readiness
across oceanographic platforms. Implemented primarily in Python3, DINOS-R is
extensible, modular, and reusable, with an emphasis on non-expert use as well
as growth for future research in oceanography and robot algorithms. Mission
specification is flexible, and can be specified declaratively. Behavior
specification is similarly flexible, supporting simultaneous use of real-time
task planning and hard-coded user specified plans. These features were
demonstrated in the field on Sentry, in addition to a variety of simulated
cases. These results are discussed, and future work is outlined.

Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法缺乏生成可控多样化轨迹的方案，而随机多样化的轨迹对于自动驾驶安全规划不够有用。人类行为具有内在不确定性和多模态特性，需要可控的语义多样性。

Method: 提出PrefCVAE框架，使用弱标记的偏好对来为潜变量赋予语义属性（如平均速度），实现可控的语义有意义预测。

Conclusion: PrefCVAE通过偏好监督成功实现了可控的多样化轨迹预测，为自动驾驶安全规划提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs)
have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in
autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable
accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial
for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and
multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate
controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly
diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we
propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled
preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using
average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables
controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline
accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a
cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.

satisfaction (i.e., constraint violation) during training. Thus, this work aims
to address both issues by proposing Reward-Oriented Gains via Embodied
Regulation (ROGER), which adapts reward-weighting gains online based on
penalties received throughout the embodied interaction process. The ratio
between the positive reward (primary reward) and negative reward (penalty)
gains is automatically reduced as the learning approaches the constraint
thresholds to avoid violation. Conversely, the ratio is increased when learning
is in safe states to prioritize performance. With a 60-kg quadruped robot,
ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning
trials. It also achieved up to 50% more primary reward than the equivalent
state-of-the-art techniques. In MuJoCo continuous locomotion benchmarks,
including a single-leg hopper, ROGER exhibited comparable or up to 100% higher
performance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation compared to
those trained with the default reward function. Finally, real-world locomotion
learning of a physical quadruped robot was achieved from scratch within one
hour without any falls. Therefore, this work contributes to
constraint-satisfying real-world continual robot locomotion learning and
simplifies reward weighting gain tuning, potentially facilitating the
development of physical robots and those that learn in the real world.

*Christopher D. Hsu,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用通用场景描述语言（USD）作为LLM机器人任务的通用表示方法，通过将真实环境转换为USD格式，利用LLM进行场景理解和任务规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法针对特定任务，缺乏通用性。USD作为XML格式的场景图，既适合LLM理解又足够丰富，能够支持各种机器人任务。

Method: 开发"Real to USD"系统，使用四足机器人搭载LiDAR和RGB相机构建室内环境的USD表示，然后使用Google Gemini解析USD进行场景理解和规划。

Result: 成功构建了包含多样化物体和挑战性环境（如玻璃）的USD表示，并展示了LLM能够进行复杂推理和规划。在模拟仓库和医院环境中也进行了验证。

Conclusion: USD是连接LLM与机器人环境的有效通用表示方法，能够支持复杂的场景理解和任务规划。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can help robots reason about abstract task
specifications. This requires augmenting classical representations of the
environment used by robots with natural language-based priors. There are a
number of existing approaches to doing so, but they are tailored to specific
tasks, e.g., visual-language models for navigation, language-guided neural
radiance fields for mapping, etc. This paper argues that the Universal Scene
Description (USD) language is an effective and general representation of
geometric, photometric and semantic information in the environment for
LLM-based robotics tasks. Our argument is simple: a USD is an XML-based scene
graph, readable by LLMs and humans alike, and rich enough to support
essentially any task -- Pixar developed this language to store assets, scenes
and even movies. We demonstrate a ``Real to USD'' system using a Unitree Go2
quadruped robot carrying LiDAR and a RGB camera that (i) builds an explicit USD
representation of indoor environments with diverse objects and challenging
settings with lots of glass, and (ii) parses the USD using Google's Gemini to
demonstrate scene understanding, complex inferences, and planning. We also
study different aspects of this system in simulated warehouse and hospital
settings using Nvidia's Issac Sim. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将人形机器人部署到现实环境中执行交互任务（如搬运物体、坐在椅子上）需要泛化性强、逼真的动作和鲁棒的场景感知能力，但现有方法难以将这些能力统一整合。

Conclusion: PhysHSI成功实现了人形机器人在物理世界中的自主交互，将逼真运动生成与鲁棒场景感知有效结合，为人形机器人的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as
carrying objects or sitting on chairs--requires generalizable, lifelike motions
and robust scene perception. Although prior approaches have advanced each
capability individually, combining them in a unified system is still an ongoing
challenge. In this work, we present a physical-world humanoid-scene interaction
system, PhysHSI, that enables humanoids to autonomously perform diverse
interaction tasks while maintaining natural and lifelike behaviors. PhysHSI
comprises a simulation training pipeline and a real-world deployment system. In
simulation, we adopt adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate
natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving
both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and
camera inputs to provide continuous and robust scene perception. We validate
PhysHSI on four representative interactive tasks--box carrying, sitting, lying,
and standing up--in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating
consistently high success rates, strong generalization across diverse task
goals, and natural motion patterns.

TL;DR: 这篇论文调查了机器人触觉感知中的数据表示问题，分析了六种常用数据结构，并提供了根据硬件、所需触觉信息和任务选择合适表示的指导原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人触觉感知需要将传感器数据转换为特定数据结构以适应高级计算技术（如计算机视觉），这种转换直接影响触觉信息编码和任务执行效果。

Method: 论文首先明确定义了在感知流程中的贡献，然后回顾了先前研究如何处理触觉信息表示问题，调查了硬件、表示方法和高级计算方法之间的关系。

Result: 分析确定了文献中常用的六种数据结构来表示触觉数据，并提供了根据操作条件选择适当表示的讨论和指导原则。

Conclusion: 该调查为解决触觉感知流程中的数据表示问题提供了系统分析，强调了硬件、表示方法和计算需求之间的相互依赖关系，为研究人员选择合适的触觉数据表示方法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Robotic tactile perception is a complex process involving several
computational steps performed at different levels. Tactile information is
shaped by the interplay of robot actions, the mechanical properties of its
body, and the software that processes the data. In this respect, high-level
computation, required to process and extract information, is commonly performed
by adapting existing techniques from other domains, such as computer vision,
which expects input data to be properly structured. Therefore, it is necessary
to transform tactile sensor data to match a specific data structure. This
operation directly affects the tactile information encoded and, as a
consequence, the task execution. This survey aims to address this specific
aspect of the tactile perception pipeline, namely Data Representation. The
paper first clearly defines its contributions to the perception pipeline and
then reviews how previous studies have dealt with the problem of representing
tactile information, investigating the relationships among hardware,
representations, and high-level computation methods. The analysis has led to
the identification of six structures commonly used in the literature to
represent data. The manuscript provides discussions and guidelines for properly
selecting a representation depending on operating conditions, including the
available hardware, the tactile information required to be encoded, and the
task at hand.

### [639] [A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448)
*Yuankai He,Hanlin Chen,Weisong Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SIM是一种用于自动驾驶车辆内部通信的共享内存传输方案，通过在ROS 2旁路运行，显著降低了数据传输延迟，提高了控制频率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要快速的控制循环和严格受限的感知到执行延迟。现有的ROS 2中间件在单计算单元上运行多个传感器和控制节点时，会引入显著的序列化、复制和发现开销，缩小了可用时间预算。

Method: SIM采用共享内存传输，保持传感器数据的原生内存布局，使用无锁有界双缓冲区优先保证数据新鲜度，并通过四行代码集成到ROS 2节点中。

Result: 在NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano上，SIM相比ROS 2零拷贝传输减少了98%的数据传输延迟，平均延迟降低约95%，尾部延迟降低约96%。在L4级车辆测试中，定位频率从7.5Hz提升到9.5Hz，感知到决策的平均延迟从521.91ms降至290.26ms。

Conclusion: SIM为自动驾驶车辆提供了一种高效的内部通信方案，在数据新鲜度和低延迟优先于保证完整性的应用场景中表现优异，显著提升了系统性能和安全性。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control
loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source
autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control
nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant
(de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available
time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport
designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data
in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double
buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into
ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM
operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness
and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence
numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering,
liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces
data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such
as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows
95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a
production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased
localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all
latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from
521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h)
on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖复杂摩擦模型或基于电机电流的扭矩估计，精度有限。需要更准确、低成本的接触检测方案来提升机器人腿部操作的可靠性。

Method: 设计低成本应变片式关节扭矩传感器，安装在每个关节提供直接扭矩测量；采用广义动量观测器框架结合分布式扭矩传感器和单个髋部FT传感器。

Result: 仿真验证在2自由度浮动基机器人腿上准确恢复大腿和小腿连杆的接触力和位置；扭矩传感器校准精度达96.4%；硬件实验显示亚厘米级接触定位精度和低于0.2N的力误差。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分布式关节扭矩传感器有效解决了接触检测问题，消除了复杂摩擦模型需求，提供了高精度的接触力测量和定位能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for detecting and localizing contact along robot
legs using distributed joint torque sensors and a single hip-mounted
force-torque (FT) sensor using a generalized momentum-based observer framework.
We designed a low-cost strain-gauge-based joint torque sensor that can be
installed on every joint to provide direct torque measurements, eliminating the
need for complex friction models and providing more accurate torque readings
than estimation based on motor current. Simulation studies on a floating-based
2-DoF robot leg verified that the proposed framework accurately recovers
contact force and location along the thigh and shin links. Through a
calibration procedure, our torque sensor achieved an average 96.4% accuracy
relative to ground truth measurements. Building upon the torque sensor, we
performed hardware experiments on a 2-DoF manipulator, which showed
sub-centimeter contact localization accuracy and force errors below 0.2 N.

*Murad Dawood,Usama Ahmed Siddiquie,Shahram Khorshidi,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的成本感知调节器，通过平滑的动作调节而非覆盖策略来减少约束违反，同时保持探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全强化学习方法要么依赖单一策略联合优化奖励和安全性（导致目标冲突不稳定），要么使用需要先验系统知识的外部安全过滤器覆盖动作。

Method: 训练一个模块化成本感知调节器，根据预测的约束违反情况缩放智能体动作，通过平滑动作调节而非覆盖策略来最小化约束违反，同时避免动作退化抑制。

Result: 在Safety Gym运动任务上实现了最先进的回报-成本比，约束违反减少了126倍，同时回报比先前方法提高了一个数量级以上。

Conclusion: 该方法与SAC、TD3等离策略RL方法无缝集成，通过平滑动作调节有效平衡了安全性和任务性能。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that
arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while
maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single
policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due
to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override
actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular
cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted
constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation
rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize
constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our
approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3,
and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion
tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times
while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior
methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种偏好条件多目标强化学习框架，用于平衡人形机器人运动中的命令跟踪和外部力顺应性，实现可部署的偏好调节人形运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法主要强调鲁棒性，导致策略抵抗外部力但缺乏顺应性，这对本就不稳定的人形机器人尤其具有挑战性。

Method: 将人形运动建模为多目标优化问题，引入偏好条件MORL框架，通过速度阻力因子建模外部力，使用编码器-解码器结构从可部署观测中推断特权特征。

Result: 在仿真和真实人形机器人实验中验证，框架不仅提高了适应性和收敛性，还实现了可部署的偏好条件人形运动。

Conclusion: 该框架成功平衡了命令跟踪和外部力顺应性，为人形机器人提供了更灵活和适应性强的运动控制方案。

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion requires not only accurate command tracking for
navigation but also compliant responses to external forces during human
interaction. Despite significant progress, existing RL approaches mainly
emphasize robustness, yielding policies that resist external forces but lack
compliance-particularly challenging for inherently unstable humanoids. In this
work, we address this by formulating humanoid locomotion as a multi-objective
optimization problem that balances command tracking and external force
compliance. We introduce a preference-conditioned multi-objective RL (MORL)
framework that integrates rigid command following and compliant behaviors
within a single omnidirectional locomotion policy. External forces are modeled
via velocity-resistance factor for consistent reward design, and training
leverages an encoder-decoder structure that infers task-relevant privileged
features from deployable observations. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments on a humanoid robot. Experimental results
indicate that our framework not only improves adaptability and convergence over
standard pipelines, but also realizes deployable preference-conditioned
humanoid locomotion.

TL;DR: 提出了IntersectioNDE模拟器，专门用于复杂城市交叉路口场景，通过交互解耦策略解决高密度异构交互的模拟挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动模拟器难以稳健地模拟城市交叉路口的密集异构交互，特别是在中国等国家，存在大量机动车辆、非机动车辆和行人的复杂交互场景。

Method: 基于CiCross数据集，提出交互解耦策略（IDS），通过从智能体子集学习组合动态，实现边际到联合的模拟，并集成到场景感知Transformer网络中。

Result: 在CiCross数据集上的实验表明，IntersectioNDE在模拟保真度、稳定性以及复制复杂城市交通动态方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IntersectioNDE能够有效模拟城市交叉路口的密集异构交互，为自动驾驶车辆的安全性和可靠性评估提供了更真实的仿真环境。

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for ensuring the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex and diverse
urban traffic environments. However, existing data-driven simulators face two
key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions
at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically
significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including
motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and
the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint
distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and
long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset
(CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban
intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions,
particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based
on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving
Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection
scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a
training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets,
enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware
Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly
enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling
heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE
outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability
to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.

TL;DR: GRIP是一个统一的模块化框架，用于机器人在动态、杂乱和语义复杂环境中的导航，通过语义占据网格、多跳锚链和LLM自省等技术，显著提高了导航成功率和路径效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态先验或有限记忆，在部分可观测性和语义模糊性下适应性受限，需要整合感知、符号推理和空间规划来泛化不同布局和对象类别。

Method: GRIP框架包含三个变体：GRIP-L（轻量级）通过语义占据网格优化符号导航；GRIP-F（完整版）支持多跳锚链和基于LLM的自省；GRIP-R（现实世界版）在感知不确定性下实现物理机器人部署。集成了动态2D网格构建、开放词汇对象接地、共现感知符号规划和混合策略执行。

Result: 在AI2-THOR和RoboTHOR基准测试中，GRIP在长视野任务上实现了高达9.6%的成功率提升和超过2倍的路径效率改进（SPL和SAE）。现实世界部署验证了在传感器噪声和环境变化下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRIP作为一个鲁棒、可扩展和可解释的框架，成功连接了仿真和现实世界导航，在模糊场景中产生可解释的符号规划。

Abstract: Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments
must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to
generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often
rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under
partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay
with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable
variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic
occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and
LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot
deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid
construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic
planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and
grid-conditioned control. Empirical results on AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks
show that GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over $2\times$
improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks. Qualitative
analyses reveal interpretable symbolic plans in ambiguous scenes. Real-world
deployment on a Jetbot further validates GRIP's generalization under sensor
noise and environmental variation. These results position GRIP as a robust,
scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world
navigation.

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现鲁棒的实时接触规划，仅使用本体感知和自我中心深度图像，在物理人形机器人上成功部署。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply
avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments.
Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited
multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free
offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To
address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned
surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model
supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation,
blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved
data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a
physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from
proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website:

Conclusion: QuayPoints框架有效保留了全局规划器的关键知识，使局部规划器能够在偏离赛车线时做出更明智的全局决策，提升了自主赛车的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous racing requires tight integration between perception, planning and
control to minimize latency as well as timely decision making. A standard
autonomy pipeline comprising a global planner, local planner, and controller
loses information as the higher-level racing context is sequentially propagated
downstream into specific task-oriented context. In particular, the global
planner's understanding of optimality is typically reduced to a sparse set of
waypoints, leaving the local planner to make reactive decisions with limited
context. This paper investigates whether additional global insights,
specifically time-optimality information, can be meaningfully passed to the
local planner to improve downstream decisions. We introduce a framework that
preserves essential global knowledge and conveys it to the local planner
through QuayPoints regions where deviations from the optimal raceline result in
significant compromises to optimality. QuayPoints enable local planners to make
more informed global decisions when deviating from the raceline, such as during
strategic overtaking. To demonstrate this, we integrate QuayPoints into an
existing planner and show that it consistently overtakes opponents traveling at
up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across four distinct race tracks.

Conclusion: 基于实时跟踪能力的自适应控制权转移策略能更自然地实现人机接管，提升系统性能和驾驶员体验。

Abstract: The transition of control from autonomous systems to human drivers is
critical in automated driving systems, particularly due to the out-of-the-loop
(OOTL) circumstances that reduce driver readiness and increase reaction times.
Existing takeover strategies are based on fixed time-based transitions, which
fail to account for real-time driver performance variations. This paper
proposes an adaptive transition strategy that dynamically adjusts the control
authority based on both the time and tracking ability of the driver trajectory.
Shared control is modeled as a cooperative differential game, where control
authority is modulated through time-varying objective functions instead of
blending control torques directly. To ensure a more natural takeover, a
driver-specific state-tracking matrix is introduced, allowing the transition to
align with individual control preferences. Multiple transition strategies are
evaluated using a cumulative trajectory error metric. Human-in-the-loop control
scenarios of the standardized ISO lane change maneuvers demonstrate that
adaptive transitions reduce trajectory deviations and driver control effort
compared to conventional strategies. Experiments also confirm that continuously
adjusting control authority based on real-time deviations enhances vehicle
stability while reducing driver effort during takeover.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and the
rise of large-scale multimodal models. Among its core challenges, robot
manipulation stands out as a fundamental yet intricate problem, requiring the
seamless integration of perception, planning, and control to enable interaction
within diverse and unstructured environments. This survey presents a
comprehensive overview of robotic manipulation, encompassing foundational
background, task-organized benchmarks and datasets, and a unified taxonomy of
existing methods. We extend the classical division between high-level planning
and low-level control by broadening high-level planning to include language,
code, motion, affordance, and 3D representations, while introducing a new
taxonomy of low-level learning-based control grounded in training paradigms
such as input modeling, latent learning, and policy learning. Furthermore, we
provide the first dedicated taxonomy of key bottlenecks, focusing on data

TL;DR: RoboMAP提出了一种连续自适应affordance热图框架，用于解决语言引导机器人系统中空间推理的脆弱性问题，显著提升了任务成功率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导机器人系统将空间推理简化为离散点，对感知噪声和语义模糊性非常脆弱，需要更鲁棒的空间表示方法。

Method: 使用连续自适应affordance热图来表示空间目标，这种密集表示能够捕捉空间grounding的不确定性，为下游策略提供更丰富信息。

Result: 在大多数grounding基准测试中超越先前SOTA，速度提升达50倍，真实世界操作任务成功率达82%，在模拟和物理实验中表现出鲁棒性能，并具有强大的零样本导航泛化能力。

Conclusion: RoboMAP通过连续affordance热图表示有效解决了语言引导机器人系统中的空间推理脆弱性问题，显著提升了系统的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Many language-guided robotic systems rely on collapsing spatial reasoning
into discrete points, making them brittle to perceptual noise and semantic
ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose RoboMAP, a framework that
represents spatial targets as continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps. This
dense representation captures the uncertainty in spatial grounding and provides
richer information for downstream policies, thereby significantly enhancing
task success and interpretability. RoboMAP surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art on a majority of grounding benchmarks with up to a 50x speed
improvement, and achieves an 82\% success rate in real-world manipulation.
Across extensive simulated and physical experiments, it demonstrates robust
performance and shows strong zero-shot generalization to navigation. More

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在自动驾驶中难以平衡安全性、效率和适应性，主要关注奖励最大化而缺乏明确的风险建模和安全约束

Method: 多层级博弈论世界模型预测周围车辆交互行为和风险，自适应滚动时域基于预测不确定性动态调整，不确定性感知屏障机制灵活调节安全边界，专门风险建模方法捕捉认知和随机不确定性

Result: 在多样化和安全关键交通场景中的广泛评估显示，GTR2L在成功率、碰撞和违规减少、驾驶效率方面显著优于最先进基线方法，包括人类驾驶员

Conclusion: GTR2L框架通过整合博弈论风险建模和强化学习，有效提升了自动驾驶在复杂动态环境中的安全性和性能

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge,
especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse
agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety,
efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization
without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L)
framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world
model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles
and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts
dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware
barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated
risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic
and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance
decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse
and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate,
collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency. The code is

TL;DR: RoVer是一个无需修改模型架构或权重的测试时扩展框架，通过机器人过程奖励模型评估候选动作的可靠性并指导动作空间探索，将计算资源转化为更好的决策能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型性能提升依赖数据规模和模型尺寸扩展的问题，这种扩展方式在机器人领域成本高昂且受限于数据收集成本

Method: 使用机器人过程奖励模型为候选动作分配标量过程奖励并预测动作空间方向，在推理时并行生成多个候选动作，沿PRM预测方向扩展，然后评分选择最优动作执行

Result: 通过共享感知特征缓存，在相同测试计算预算下评估更多候选动作，实现测试时扩展而无需额外训练开销

Conclusion: RoVer提供了一个通用的即插即用测试时扩展框架，将可用计算资源转化为更好的动作决策能力

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for
embodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on
scaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively
expensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs.We
address this limitation with $\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling
framework that uses a $\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a
Test-Time $\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA
models without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer
(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of
candidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate
expansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate
actions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted
directions, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal
action for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can
amortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time
computational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms
available computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the
benefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling
framework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and
an action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient
direction-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to
enable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference.

Result: 在真实室内环境中进行的广泛实验表明，该方法在磁干扰条件下能提供精确的航向估计

Conclusion: AMO-HEAD方法在磁干扰环境下能够实现可靠且精确的无人机航向估计

Abstract: Accurate and robust heading estimation is crucial for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) when conducting indoor inspection tasks. However, the cluttered
nature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances,
which can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge,
this paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation
approach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is
a lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
framework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable
heading estimation. In the proposed approach, gyroscope angular rate
measurements are integrated to propagate the quaternion state, which is
subsequently corrected using accelerometer and magnetometer data. The corrected
quaternion is then used to compute the UAV's heading. An adaptive process noise
covariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope
measurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler
method integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances,
a scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection. A
theoretical observability analysis of the proposed AMO-HEAD is performed using
the Lie derivative. Extensive experiments were conducted in real world indoor
environments with customized UAV platforms. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing precise heading estimation
under magnetically disturbed conditions.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

Motivation: 模拟学习在接触密集型任务中达到约80%的成功率，但这对工业应用来说不够可靠，且策略链化特别脆弱。关键限制是不同初始条件下个体策略性能的高方差。

Method: 提出Refinery框架：使用贝叶斯优化指导的策略微调来改进个体策略；在部署时使用高斯混合模型采样选择能最大化执行成功率的初始化条件。

Result: 在机器人装配的模拟学习中，比最先进方法平均成功率提高10.98%，达到91.51%的模拟成功率，并在真实世界中获得相当性能。能成功组装多达8个零件，无需显式的多步训练。

Conclusion: Refinery框架有效缩小了模拟学习与工业标准之间的性能差距，显著提高了策略在多样化初始条件下的鲁棒性，使策略链化成为可能。

Abstract: Simulation-based learning has enabled policies for precise, contact-rich
tasks (e.g., robotic assembly) to reach high success rates (~80%) under high
levels of observation noise and control error. Although such performance may be
sufficient for research applications, it falls short of industry standards and
makes policy chaining exceptionally brittle. A key limitation is the high
variance in individual policy performance across diverse initial conditions. We
introduce Refinery, an effective framework that bridges this performance gap,
robustifying policy performance across initial conditions. We propose Bayesian
Optimization-guided fine-tuning to improve individual policies, and Gaussian
Mixture Model-based sampling during deployment to select initializations that
maximize execution success. Using Refinery, we improve mean success rates by
10.98% over state-of-the-art methods in simulation-based learning for robotic
assembly, reaching 91.51% in simulation and comparable performance in the real
world. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these fine-tuned policies can be
chained to accomplish long-horizon, multi-part
assembly$\unicode{x2013}$successfully assembling up to 8 parts without
requiring explicit multi-step training.

Motivation: 现有机器人抓取方法通常只针对单一夹爪类型设计，限制了在需要多样化末端执行器的实际场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Most robotic grasping methods are typically designed for single gripper
types, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring
diverse end-effectors. We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp
detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations.
The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting
existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical
two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP)
identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper
specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the
grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP
module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning
fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates
seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future
vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive
grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial
improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

Conclusion: 提出的DRLACP框架能有效处理自主车辆协同运动规划中的各种不确定性，展现出优越性能。

Abstract: In future intelligent transportation systems, autonomous cooperative planning
(ACP), becomes a promising technique to increase the effectiveness and security
of multi-vehicle interactions. However, multiple uncertainties cannot be fully
addressed for existing ACP strategies, e.g. perception, planning, and
communication uncertainties. To address these, a novel deep reinforcement
learning-based autonomous cooperative planning (DRLACP) framework is proposed
to tackle various uncertainties on cooperative motion planning schemes.
Specifically, the soft actor-critic (SAC) with the implementation of gate
recurrent units (GRUs) is adopted to learn the deterministic optimal
time-varying actions with imperfect state information occurred by planning,
communication, and perception uncertainties. In addition, the real-time actions
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are demonstrated via the Car Learning to Act
(CARLA) simulation platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed DRLACP
learns and performs cooperative planning effectively, which outperforms other
baseline methods under different scenarios with imperfect AV state information.

Abstract: Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a
fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based
approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models,
removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation
fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer
blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are
common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data
further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning
methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose
Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in
data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first
introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory
into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory
modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient
temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better
capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow
matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation,
which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain
coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive
scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset
and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner
achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while
effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation methods are essential for the recovery of lower limb
dysfunction caused by stroke. Nowadays, robotic exoskeletons have shown great
potentials in rehabilitation. Nevertheless, traditional rigid exoskeletons are
usually heavy and need a lot of work to help the patients to put them on.
Moreover, it also requires extra compliance control to guarantee the safety. In
contrast, soft exoskeletons are easy and comfortable to wear and have intrinsic
compliance, but their complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics would
pose significant challenges for control. In this work, based on the pneumatic
actuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee
that is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and
enable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to
model the human-robot interaction dynamics. In particular, by viewing the
electromyography (EMG) signals and the duty cycle of the PWM wave that controls
the pneumatic robot's valves and pump as the inputs, the linear Koopman model
accurately captures the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. Next, based
on the obtained Koopman model, we further use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to
control the soft robot and help the user to do rehabilitation training in
real-time. The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given
reference signal shown on the screen. Experiments show that by integrating the
EMG signals into the Koopman model, we have improved the model accuracy to
great extent. In addition, a personalized Koopman model trained from the
individual's own data performs better than the non-personalized model.
Consequently, our control framework outperforms the traditional PID control in
both passive and active training modes. Hence the proposed method provides a
new control framework for soft rehabilitation robots.

TL;DR: 系统评估了SO(3)动作表示在强化学习中的表现，发现局部坐标系中的切向量表示在多种算法中表现最可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人控制任务需要在SO(3)上操作，但SO(3)的几何特性使得动作表示选择复杂，不同表示方法在强化学习中的影响尚不明确。

Method: 在三种标准连续控制算法(PPO、SAC、TD3)下，使用密集和稀疏奖励，系统比较了SO(3)动作表示对探索、熵正则化和训练稳定性的影响。

Result: 表示诱导的几何特性强烈影响探索和优化，局部坐标系中的切向量表示在跨算法中表现最可靠。

Conclusion: 为选择和使用旋转动作提供了简单实用的指导原则，强调表示几何对强化学习性能的重要影响。

Abstract: Many robotic control tasks require policies to act on orientations, yet the
geometry of SO(3) makes this nontrivial. Because SO(3) admits no global,
smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles,
quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct
constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for
supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning
remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across
three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense
and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact
with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical
studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining
valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics
benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill
simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation
actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly
influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as
tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across
algorithms.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve
versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made
significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains
underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly
real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We
present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables
generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single
demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a
low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies
for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands
to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.
The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and
imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop
visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments
show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy
performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and
the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1
robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of
DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten
loco-manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Rotor failures in quadrotors may result in high-speed rotation and vibration
due to rotor imbalance, which introduces significant challenges for autonomous
flight in unknown environments. The mainstream approaches against rotor
failures rely on fault-tolerant control (FTC) and predefined trajectory
tracking. To the best of our knowledge, online failure detection and diagnosis
(FDD), trajectory planning, and FTC of the post-failure quadrotors in unknown
and complex environments have not yet been achieved. This paper presents a
rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system designed to mitigate the
impacts of rotor imbalance. First, a composite FDD-based nonlinear model
predictive controller (NMPC), incorporating motor dynamics, is designed to
ensure fast failure detection and flight stability. Second, a
rotor-failure-aware planner is designed to leverage FDD results and
spatial-temporal joint optimization, while a LiDAR-based quadrotor platform
with four anti-torque plates is designed to enable reliable perception under
high-speed rotation. Lastly, extensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art
methods highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach in
addressing rotor failures, including propeller unloading and motor stoppage.
The experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that our approach
enables autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging
environments, including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.

Abstract: Robot person following (RPF) is a core capability in human-robot interaction,
enabling robots to assist users in daily activities, collaborative work, and
other service scenarios. However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging
due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.
Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse
candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot
adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as
pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory
sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware
zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the
optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the
predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model
predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this
trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian
motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human
comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Effective generalization in robotic manipulation requires representations
that capture invariant patterns of interaction across environments and tasks.
We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation
concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory
correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human
annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that
identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon
predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales.
Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to
focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both
immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated
benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance
improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the
learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite
receiving no semantic supervision. This work advances both the understanding of
representation learning for manipulation and provides a practical approach to
enhancing robotic performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for humanoid robots to execute
inspection tasks with high efficiency and millimeter-level precision. The
approach combines hierarchical planning, time-optimal standing position
generation, and integrated \ac{mpc} to achieve high speed and precision. A
hierarchical planning strategy, leveraging \ac{ik} and \ac{mip}, reduces
computational complexity by decoupling the high-dimensional planning problem. A
novel MIP formulation optimizes standing position selection and trajectory
length, minimizing task completion time. Furthermore, an MPC system with
simplified kinematics and single-step position correction ensures
millimeter-level end-effector tracking accuracy. Validated through simulations
and experiments on the Kuavo 4Pro humanoid platform, the framework demonstrates
low time cost and a high success rate in multi-location tasks, enabling
efficient and precise execution of complex industrial operations.

Motivation: 四旋翼无人机在复杂动态环境中具有巨大应用潜力，但由于其欠驱动特性和平移-旋转动力学的强耦合性，实现精确控制仍面临挑战。

Method: 使用对偶四元数表示四旋翼动力学和位姿误差，在双四元数流形上构建紧凑且全局非奇异的控制框架，准确捕捉四旋翼的耦合动力学特性。

Result: 相比传统NMPC方法，位置和姿态跟踪误差分别降低56.11%和56.77%，在11m×4.5m×3.65m的受限空间内成功处理激进轨迹，达到13.66m/s的最大速度和4.2g的加速度。

Conclusion: DQ-NMPC框架通过双四元数表示有效解决了四旋翼控制中的奇异性问题，显著提升了敏捷飞行中的跟踪性能和数值稳定性。

Abstract: MAVs have great potential to assist humans in complex tasks, with
applications ranging from logistics to emergency response. Their agility makes
them ideal for operations in complex and dynamic environments. However,
achieving precise control in agile flights remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to the underactuated nature of quadrotors and the strong
coupling between their translational and rotational dynamics. In this work, we
propose a novel NMPC framework based on dual-quaternions (DQ-NMPC) for
quadrotor flight. By representing both quadrotor dynamics and the pose error
directly on the dual-quaternion manifold, our approach enables a compact and
globally non-singular formulation that captures the quadrotor coupled dynamics.
We validate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating better numerical conditioning and significantly improved tracking
performance, with reductions in position and orientation errors of up to 56.11%
and 56.77%, compared to a conventional baseline NMPC method. Furthermore, our
controller successfully handles aggressive trajectories, reaching maximum
speeds up to 13.66 m/s and accelerations reaching 4.2 g within confined space
conditions of dimensions 11m x 4.5m x 3.65m under which the baseline controller
fails.

Conclusion: 该方法将状态估计、传感器和运动学校准统一为一个原则性的、数据驱动的框架，适用于各种机器人平台。

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for legged and aerial robots operating
in dynamic, uncertain environments. A key challenge lies in specifying process
and measurement noise covariances, which are typically unknown or manually
tuned. In this work, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework that
jointly calibrates covariance matrices and kinematic parameters in an
estimator-in-the-loop manner. The upper level treats noise covariances and
model parameters as optimization variables, while the lower level executes a
full-information estimator. Differentiating through the estimator allows direct
optimization of trajectory-level objectives, resulting in accurate and
consistent state estimates. We validate our approach on quadrupedal and
humanoid robots, demonstrating significantly improved estimation accuracy and
uncertainty calibration compared to hand-tuned baselines. Our method unifies
state estimation, sensor, and kinematics calibration into a principled,
data-driven framework applicable across diverse robotic platforms.

Motivation: 强化学习虽然能学习鲁棒控制策略，但奖励函数设计复杂且不直观；而离线轨迹优化方法虽然可调性和可解释性强，但对现实世界扰动脆弱。需要结合两者优势。

Method: 分层框架：高层使用离线优化步态库插值生成参考运动，低层使用强化学习策略提供残差修正来稳定和调制参考轨迹。

Result: NaviGait相比传统和模仿强化学习训练更快，生成的运动最接近原始参考，实现了动态鲁棒的运动控制。

Conclusion: 通过解耦高层运动生成和低层修正，NaviGait为动态鲁棒运动控制提供了更可扩展和泛化的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method to learn robust
control policies for bipedal locomotion. Yet, it can be difficult to tune
desired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In
comparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics,
offer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans
for high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain
brittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations.
  In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the
structure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and
intuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized
gaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference
motions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both
joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize
the reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of
NaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich
motion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned
shaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our
experimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared
to conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain
closest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion
generation from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and
generalizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all
baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to
acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of end effector interaction forces in hydraulic
excavators is a key enabler for advanced automation in heavy machinery.
Accurate knowledge of these forces allows improved, precise grading and digging
maneuvers. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-accuracy,
retrofittable 2D force- and payload estimation algorithm that does not impose
additional requirements on the operator regarding trajectory, acceleration or
the use of the slew joint. The approach is designed for retrofittability,
requires minimal calibration and no prior knowledge of machine-specific dynamic
characteristics. Specifically, we propose a method for identifying a dynamic
model, necessary to estimate both end effector interaction forces and bucket
payload during normal operation. Our optimization-based payload estimation
achieves a full-scale payload accuracy of 1%. On a standard 25 t excavator, the
online force measurement from pressure and inertial measurements achieves a
direction accuracy of 13 degree and a magnitude accuracy of 383 N. The method's

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be
expensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies
trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real
transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise
dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL
pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter

approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric
reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions
over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from
interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical
parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based
uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying
center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,
Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization
baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%
in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion
for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and
interaction information is essential for success. Project website:

TL;DR: 提出UDSE模型，将语音增强重新定义为离散域分类任务，通过预测预训练神经语音编解码器的离散token来增强多种失真类型的语音信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中语音信号常受多种干扰同时影响，但现有语音增强方法大多只处理有限类型的失真，限制了在实际环境中的泛化能力和实用性。

Method: UDSE首先从退化语音中提取全局特征，然后根据RVQ规则预测干净的离散token，每个VQ的预测依赖于前一个的结果，最后解码所有VQ的预测token重构干净语音波形。

Result: 实验证实UDSE能有效增强多种常规和非常规失真（如加性噪声、混响、带宽限制、削波、相位失真、压缩失真及其组合）的语音信号。

Conclusion: 相比先进的基于回归的语音增强方法，UDSE展现出更优越的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, speech signals are inevitably corrupted by various
types of interference, making speech enhancement (SE) a critical task for
robust speech processing. However, most existing SE methods only handle a
limited range of distortions, such as additive noise, reverberation, or band
limitation, while the study of SE under multiple simultaneous distortions
remains limited. This gap affects the generalization and practical usability of
SE methods in real-world environments.To address this gap, this paper proposes
a novel Universal Discrete-domain SE model called UDSE.Unlike regression-based
SE models that directly predict clean speech waveform or continuous features,
UDSE redefines SE as a discrete-domain classification task, instead predicting
the clean discrete tokens quantized by the residual vector quantizer (RVQ) of a
pre-trained neural speech codec.Specifically, UDSE first extracts global
features from the degraded speech. Guided by these global features, the clean
token prediction for each VQ follows the rules of RVQ, where the prediction of
each VQ relies on the results of the preceding ones. Finally, the predicted
clean tokens from all VQs are decoded to reconstruct the clean speech waveform.
During training, the UDSE model employs a teacher-forcing strategy, and is
optimized with cross-entropy loss. Experimental results confirm that the
proposed UDSE model can effectively enhance speech degraded by various
conventional and unconventional distortions, e.g., additive noise,
reverberation, band limitation, clipping, phase distortion, and compression
distortion, as well as their combinations. These results demonstrate the
superior universality and practicality of UDSE compared to advanced
regression-based SE methods.

Abstract: Although speech emotion recognition (SER) research has been advanced, thanks
to deep learning methods, it still suffers from obtaining inputs from large
quality-labelled training data. Data augmentation methods have been attempted
to mitigate this issue, generative models have shown success among them
recently. We propose a data augmentation framework that is aided by cross-modal
information transfer and mutual information regularization. Mutual information
based metric can serve as an indicator for the quality. Furthermore, we expand
this data augmentation scope to multimodal inputs, thanks to mutual information
ensureing dependency between modalities. Our framework was tested on three
benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV and MSP-Podcast. The implementation was
designed to generate input features that are fed into last layer for emotion
classification. Our framework improved the performance of emotion prediction
against existing works. Also, we discovered that our framework is able to
generate new inputs without any cross-modal information.

Abstract: Real-time music alignment, also known as score following, is a fundamental
MIR task with a long history and is essential for many interactive
applications. Despite its importance, there has not been a unified open
framework for comparing models, largely due to the inherent complexity of
real-time processing and the language- or system-dependent implementations. In
addition, low compatibility with the existing MIR environment has made it
difficult to develop benchmarks using large datasets available in recent years.
While new studies based on established methods (e.g., dynamic programming,
probabilistic models) have emerged, most evaluations compare models only within
the same family or on small sets of test data. This paper introduces
Matchmaker, an open-source Python library for real-time music alignment that is
easy to use and compatible with modern MIR libraries. Using this, we
systematically compare methods along two dimensions: music representations and
alignment methods. We evaluated our approach on a large test set of solo piano
music from the (n)ASAP, Batik, and Vienna4x22 datasets with a comprehensive set
of metrics to ensure robust assessment. Our work aims to establish a benchmark
framework for score-following research while providing a practical tool that
developers can easily integrate into their applications.

advancements in low-informed EPR systems offer a more accessible alternative by
directly utilizing score-derived MIDI as input, but these systems often exhibit
suboptimal performance. Meanwhile, existing works are evaluated with diverse
automatic metrics and data formats, hindering direct objective comparisons
between EPR systems. In this study, we introduce Peransformer, a
transformer-based low-informed EPR system designed to bridge the gap between
low-informed and highly-informed EPR systems. Our approach incorporates a
score-aware discriminator that leverages the underlying score-derived MIDI
files and is trained on a score-to-performance paired, note-to-note aligned
MIDI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that Peransformer achieves
state-of-the-art performance among low-informed systems, as validated by
subjective evaluations. Furthermore, we extend existing automatic evaluation
metrics for EPR systems and introduce generalized EPR metrics (GEM), enabling
more direct, accurate, and reliable comparisons across EPR systems.

TL;DR: 提出ProGress框架，结合申克分析法与扩散模型，用于生成结构连贯且可解释的音乐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI音乐生成模型缺乏结构连贯性（特别是和声-旋律结构），且多为"黑盒"模型，缺乏音乐可解释性

Method: 1) 将DiGress离散扩散模型适配于音乐生成 2) 基于申克分析法的乐句融合方法 3) 用户可控的生成框架

Result: 人类实验结果表明优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: ProGress框架通过结合申克分析与扩散模型，实现了结构连贯且可解释的音乐生成

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music generation is undergoing rapid
developments, with recent symbolic models leveraging sophisticated deep
learning and diffusion model algorithms. One drawback with existing models is
that they lack structural cohesion, particularly on harmonic-melodic structure.
Furthermore, such existing models are largely "black-box" in nature and are not
musically interpretable. This paper addresses these limitations via a novel
generative music framework that incorporates concepts of Schenkerian analysis
(SchA) in concert with a diffusion modeling framework. This framework, which we
call ProGress (Prolongation-enhanced DiGress), adapts state-of-the-art deep
models for discrete diffusion (in particular, the DiGress model of Vignac et
al., 2023) for interpretable and structured music generation. Concretely, our
contributions include 1) novel adaptations of the DiGress model for music
generation, 2) a novel SchA-inspired phrase fusion methodology, and 3) a
framework allowing users to control various aspects of the generation process
to create coherent musical compositions. Results from human experiments suggest
superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集大多只提供单声道音频，限制了空间音频生成和理解的发展，而空间音频在VR/AR等沉浸式技术中至关重要。

Method: 构建包含四个组件（MRSLife、MRSSpeech、MRSMusic、MRSSing）的大规模数据集，涵盖不同真实场景，提供同步的双耳和环绕声音频、视频、运动轨迹及细粒度标注。

Result: MRSAudio支持高质量的空间建模，能够促进广泛的空间音频研究，在五个基础任务上表现出色。

Conclusion: MRSAudio数据集解决了空间音频研究的瓶颈，为空间音频理解和生成提供了全面的资源，推动了沉浸式技术的发展。

Abstract: Humans rely on multisensory integration to perceive spatial environments,
where auditory cues enable sound source localization in three-dimensional
space. Despite the critical role of spatial audio in immersive technologies
such as VR/AR, most existing multimodal datasets provide only monaural audio,
which limits the development of spatial audio generation and understanding. To
address these challenges, we introduce MRSAudio, a large-scale multimodal
spatial audio dataset designed to advance research in spatial audio
understanding and generation. MRSAudio spans four distinct components: MRSLife,
MRSSpeech, MRSMusic, and MRSSing, covering diverse real-world scenarios. The
dataset includes synchronized binaural and ambisonic audio, exocentric and
egocentric video, motion trajectories, and fine-grained annotations such as
transcripts, phoneme boundaries, lyrics, scores, and prompts. To demonstrate
the utility and versatility of MRSAudio, we establish five foundational tasks:
audio spatialization, and spatial text to speech, spatial singing voice
synthesis, spatial music generation and sound event localization and detection.
Results show that MRSAudio enables high-quality spatial modeling and supports a
broad range of spatial audio research. Demos and dataset access are available

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出KDFIP框架，通过门控参数隔离策略将通用知识和个性化知识分离存储，顺序应用功能不变路径，在保持通用性能的同时显著提升个性化ASR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用大规模合成个人数据微调通用ASR模型可以增强个性化，但面临两个挑战：适应合成个人数据时不忘记真实知识，适应个人数据时不忘记通用知识。

Method: 将门控参数隔离策略集成到FIP中，提出KDFIP框架，将通用和个性化知识存储在独立模块中，顺序应用FIP。个性化模块适应合成和真实个人数据，通用模块适应通用数据，通过门控机制动态融合输出。

Result: 使用增强的合成数据，KDFIP在目标说话人上实现了29.38%的相对字符错误率降低，同时保持了与未适应ASR基线相当的泛化性能。

Conclusion: KDFIP框架有效解决了ASR模型个性化中的知识平衡问题，在提升个性化性能的同时保持了通用性能，为个性化ASR提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning generic ASR models with large-scale synthetic personal data can
enhance the personalization of ASR models, but it introduces challenges in
adapting to synthetic personal data without forgetting real knowledge, and in
adapting to personal data without forgetting generic knowledge. Considering
that the functionally invariant path (FIP) framework enables model adaptation
while preserving prior knowledge, in this letter, we introduce FIP into
synthetic-data-augmented personalized ASR models. However, the model still
struggles to balance the learning of synthetic, personalized, and generic
knowledge when applying FIP to train the model on all three types of data
simultaneously. To decouple this learning process and further address the above
two challenges, we integrate a gated parameter-isolation strategy into FIP and
propose a knowledge-decoupled functionally invariant path (KDFIP) framework,
which stores generic and personalized knowledge in separate modules and applies
FIP to them sequentially. Specifically, KDFIP adapts the personalized module to
synthetic and real personal data and the generic module to generic data. Both
modules are updated along personalization-invariant paths, and their outputs
are dynamically fused through a gating mechanism. With augmented synthetic
data, KDFIP achieves a 29.38% relative character error rate reduction on target
speakers and maintains comparable generalization performance to the unadapted
ASR baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于低层级信号指标优化的声音分离模型会产生语义污染输出，无法有效抑制声学相似源的感知显著干扰。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，学习因子化Beta掩码策略，使用裁剪信任域代理、熵正则化和组相对优势归一化进行优化，并通过多模态奖励（音频-文本-视觉编码器）激励语义一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，文本、音频和图像查询分离任务均取得一致提升，信号指标和语义质量均有显著改善。

Conclusion: MARS-Sep通过强化学习框架有效解决了声音分离中的语义对齐问题，在保持信号质量的同时显著提升了语义一致性。

Abstract: Universal sound separation faces a fundamental misalignment: models optimized
for low-level signal metrics often produce semantically contaminated outputs,
failing to suppress perceptually salient interference from acoustically similar
sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce MARS-Sep, a reinforcement learning
framework that reformulates separation as decision making. Instead of simply
regressing ground-truth masks, MARS-Sep learns a factorized Beta mask policy
that is optimized by a clipped trust-region surrogate with entropy
regularization and group-relative advantage normalization. Concretely, we
sample masks from a frozen old policy, reconstruct waveforms, and update the
current policy using clipped importance ratios-yielding substantially more
stable and sample-efficient learning. Multimodal rewards, derived from an
audio-text-vision encoder, directly incentivize semantic consistency with query
prompts. We further propose a progressive alignment scheme to fine-tune this
encoder, boosting its cross-modal discriminability and improving reward
faithfulness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in Text-, Audio-, and Image-Queried separation, with notable
improvements in signal metrics and semantic quality. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器学习的吉他谱转录方法，能够将MIDI音乐转换为可演奏的吉他指法谱，并探索了非吉他音乐的转录可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 吉他谱转录需要将音符分配到合适的弦和品位上，既要保证可演奏性，又要保持指法间的连贯性。传统吉他演奏中形成了特定的和弦指法和指法模式，但现有方法缺乏对这些吉他特有表达特性的考虑。

Method: 采用机器学习方法，基于手指在指板上的伸展能力假设，仅考虑标准6弦吉他调弦。通过基础数据增强方法处理非吉他音乐，使用人工数据进行训练和测试。

Result: 实验表明，使用增强数据训练的系统性能得到提升，即使在简单的单音情况下也是如此。结果揭示了系统在特定情况下的弱点。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了吉他谱转录的可行性，数据增强有助于提升性能，但仍有改进空间，特别是在处理复杂音乐和吉他特有表达特性方面。

Abstract: Guitar tablature transcription consists in deducing the string and the fret
number on which each note should be played to reproduce the actual musical
part. This assignment should lead to playable string-fret combinations
throughout the entire track and, in general, preserve parsimonious motion
between successive combinations. Throughout the history of guitar playing,
specific chord fingerings have been developed across different musical styles
that facilitate common idiomatic voicing combinations and motion between them.
This paper presents a method for assigning guitar tablature notation to a given
MIDI-based musical part (possibly consisting of multiple polyphonic tracks),
i.e. no information about guitar-idiomatic expressional characteristics is
involved (e.g. bending etc.) The current strategy is based on machine learning
and requires a basic assumption about how much fingers can stretch on a
fretboard; only standard 6-string guitar tuning is examined. The proposed
method also examines the transcription of music pieces that was not meant to be
played or could not possibly be played by a guitar (e.g. potentially a
symphonic orchestra part), employing a rudimentary method for augmenting
musical information and training/testing the system with artificial data. The
results present interesting aspects about what the system can achieve when
trained on the initial and augmented dataset, showing that the training with
augmented data improves the performance even in simple, e.g. monophonic, cases.
Results also indicate weaknesses and lead to useful conclusions about possible
improvements.

Abstract: In-car multi-zone speech separation, which captures voices from different
speech zones, plays a crucial role in human-vehicle interaction. Although
previous SpatialNet has achieved notable results, its high computational cost
still hinders real-time applications in vehicles. To this end, this paper
proposes LSZone, a lightweight spatial information modeling architecture for
real-time in-car multi-zone speech separation. We design a spatial information
extraction-compression (SpaIEC) module that combines Mel spectrogram and
Interaural Phase Difference (IPD) to reduce computational burden while
maintaining performance. Additionally, to efficiently model spatial
information, we introduce an extremely lightweight Conv-GRU
crossband-narrowband processing (CNP) module. Experimental results demonstrate
that LSZone, with a complexity of 0.56G MACs and a real-time factor (RTF) of
0.37, delivers impressive performance in complex noise and multi-speaker
scenarios.

Motivation: 心音图的自动分析对心血管疾病早期诊断至关重要，但监督深度学习常受限于专家标注数据的稀缺性。

Method: 自监督双路径对比学习架构，同时处理1D波形和2D频谱图，使用混合损失函数；下游任务采用原型网络的度量学习方法。

Conclusion: SS-DPPN被验证为生理信号的稳健、可靠且可扩展的基础模型。

Abstract: The automated analysis of phonocardiograms is vital for the early diagnosis
of cardiovascular disease, yet supervised deep learning is often constrained by
the scarcity of expert-annotated data. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Supervised Dual-Path Prototypical Network (SS-DPPN), a foundation model
for cardiac audio representation and classification from unlabeled data. The
framework introduces a dual-path contrastive learning based architecture that
simultaneously processes 1D waveforms and 2D spectrograms using a novel hybrid
loss. For the downstream task, a metric-learning approach using a Prototypical
Network was used that enhances sensitivity and produces well-calibrated and
trustworthy predictions. SS-DPPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
cardiac audio benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional data
efficiency with a fully supervised model on three-fold reduction in labeled
data. Finally, the learned representations generalize successfully across lung
sound classification and heart rate estimation. Our experiments and findings
validate SS-DPPN as a robust, reliable, and scalable foundation model for
physiological signals.

TL;DR: 本文针对通用ASR系统对非典型说话者（如L2学习者）表现不佳的问题，提出了两种策略来改善公平性：熟练度感知多任务学习和目标增强，显著降低了WER和插入/删除错误，并缩小了熟练度差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用ASR系统对非典型说话者（如L2学习者）表现不佳，这会加剧偏见并限制其在教育和无障碍领域的应用。

Method: 提出了两种策略：(i) 熟练度感知多任务学习，联合优化ASR和熟练度分类；(ii) 目标增强，对低熟练度语音应用频谱图掩码以应对数据不平衡。

Result: 这些方法将WER相对降低了29.4%，插入/删除错误相对降低了58.6%，并在反映真实世界分布的不平衡数据集上持续缩小了熟练度差距。

Conclusion: 这些策略推进了面向L2学习者的公平ASR系统，尽管数据集存在严重不平衡，但两种方法都能一致地缩小熟练度差距。

Abstract: General-purpose ASR underperforms for atypical speakers, such as L2 learners,
reinforcing bias and limiting use in education and accessibility. Using the
CEFR-graded Speak and Improve corpus, we show that naive fine-tuning of Whisper
reduces average WER but simultaneously widens disparities and
disproportionately harms lower-level learners. To address this, we propose two
strategies: (i) proficiency-aware multitask learning, jointly optimizing ASR
with proficiency classification, and (ii) targeted augmentation, applying
spectrogram masking to low-proficiency speech to counter imbalance. These
approaches reduce WER by up to 29.4 percent (relative) and insertion/deletion
errors by as much as 58.6 percent (relative). Crucially, despite the severe
imbalance of the dataset reflecting real-world distributions, both strategies
consistently narrow proficiency gaps, advancing equitable ASR for L2 learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了开发更鲁棒的用户自定义关键词检测系统，需要解决传统方法在混淆词区分和零样本性能方面的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用CTC方法和流式音素搜索定位候选片段；第二阶段使用QbyT方法和音素匹配器在音素和话语级别进行验证。引入双数据扩展策略：扩展ASR语料库和利用大量锚点类别训练音素匹配器。

Result: 在LibriPhrase数据集上，Hard子集达到6.13% EER和97.85% AUC；在Hey-Snips数据集上实现零样本性能，达到99.13%召回率和每小时一个误报。

Conclusion: DS-KWS框架通过创新的两阶段设计和双数据扩展策略，在关键词检测任务中取得了显著性能提升，特别是在零样本场景下表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DS-KWS, a two-stage framework for robust
user-defined keyword spotting. It combines a CTC-based method with a streaming
phoneme search module to locate candidate segments, followed by a QbyT-based
method with a phoneme matcher module for verification at both the phoneme and
utterance levels. To further improve performance, we introduce a dual data
scaling strategy: (1) expanding the ASR corpus from 460 to 1,460 hours to
strengthen the acoustic model; and (2) leveraging over 155k anchor classes to
train the phoneme matcher, significantly enhancing the distinction of
confusable words. Experiments on LibriPhrase show that DS-KWS significantly
outperforms existing methods, achieving 6.13\% EER and 97.85\% AUC on the Hard
subset. On Hey-Snips, it achieves zero-shot performance comparable to full-shot
trained models, reaching 99.13\% recall at one false alarm per hour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语虽然在全球有超过1亿使用者，但在高质量语音语料库中严重不足，特别是用于文本转语音合成的应用。现有的波斯语语音数据集通常比英语对应数据集小，这限制了波斯语语音技术的发展。

Method: 创建了一个自动化流水线，将原始有声读物内容转换为TTS就绪数据，包括基于BERT的句子补全检测器、用于精确音频文本对齐的二分搜索边界优化方法，以及针对波斯语定制的多维质量评估框架。

Result: 处理了2,000本有声读物，产生了3,526小时的干净语音，进一步筛选出1,804小时的高质量子集，包含470多名说话者。ParsVoice是最大的高质量波斯语语音数据集，说话者多样性和音频质量可与主要英语语料库相媲美。

Conclusion: ParsVoice数据集已公开提供，以加速波斯语语音技术的发展，并为其他低资源语言提供模板。

Abstract: Persian Language, despite being spoken by over 100 million people worldwide,
remains severely underrepresented in high-quality speech corpora, particularly
for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis applications. Existing Persian speech
datasets are typically smaller than their English counterparts, which creates a
key limitation for developing Persian speech technologies. We address this gap
by introducing ParsVoice, the largest Persian speech corpus designed
specifically for TTS applications. We created an automated pipeline that
transforms raw audiobook content into TTS-ready data, incorporating components
such as a BERT-based sentence completion detector, a binary search boundary
optimization method for precise audio-text alignment, and multi-dimensional
quality assessment frameworks tailored to Persian. The pipeline processes 2,000
audiobooks, yielding 3,526 hours of clean speech, which was further filtered
into a 1,804-hour high-quality subset suitable for TTS, featuring more than 470
speakers. ParsVoice is the largest high-quality Persian speech dataset,
offering speaker diversity and audio quality comparable to major English
corpora. The complete dataset has been made publicly available to accelerate
the development of Persian speech technologies and to serve as a template for
other low-resource languages. The ParsVoice dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出一个可控口音转换框架，允许用户通过显式参数控制口音修改程度，在保持说话人身份的同时实现口音转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有口音转换方法缺乏对口音修改程度的显式控制，而口音修改会影响说话人身份感知，因此需要在转换强度和身份保持之间取得平衡。

Method: 开发了一个口音转换框架，提供用户可控的参数来调节口音修改程度，主要针对发音特征进行修改，同时保留超音段特征如语调和音素时长。

Result: 性能与近期口音转换系统相当，但能更好地保持说话人身份，并独特地支持可控的口音转换。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了可控的口音转换，在保持说话人身份的同时提供灵活的口音修改控制。

Abstract: Previous accent conversion (AC) methods, including foreign accent conversion
(FAC), lack explicit control over the degree of modification. Because accent
modification can alter the perceived speaker identity, balancing conversion
strength and identity preservation is crucial. We present an AC framework that
provides an explicit, user-controllable parameter for accent modification. The
method targets pronunciation while preserving suprasegmental cues such as
intonation and phoneme durations. Results show performance comparable to recent
AC systems, stronger preservation of speaker identity, and unique support for
controllable accent conversion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缩放定律在计算机视觉和自然语言处理中已得到深入研究，但在通用音频表示学习中的应用仍未被充分探索。主要挑战在于音频表示质量受多种因素共同影响，难以单独分析。

Method: 使用嵌入有效秩(RankMe)作为无标签、信息论导向的音频嵌入量化指标，在广泛的超参数空间（包括模型大小、训练数据量、计算预算、架构配置等）中检验缩放行为。

Result: 实证发现RankMe与表示质量之间存在一致的幂律关系，表明嵌入有效秩可作为评估和预测音频表示学习模型性能的可靠代理指标。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅验证了经典缩放原理在通用音频领域的适用性，还为音频基础模型的未来缩放策略提供了理论基础和实证框架。

Abstract: Scaling laws have profoundly shaped our understanding of model performance in
computer vision and natural language processing, yet their application to
general audio representation learning remains underexplored. A key challenge
lies in the multifactorial nature of general audio
representation-representation quality is jointly influenced by variables such
as audio length, embedding dimensionality, model depth, model architecture,
data volume, etc., many of which are difficult to isolate or express
analytically. In this work, we present a systematic study of scaling laws for
general audio representations by utilizing embedding effective rank (RankMe) as
a unifying metric that encapsulates the impact of diverse variables on
representation quality. RankMe enables a label-free, information-theoretic
quantification of audio embeddings, allowing us to examine scaling behaviors
across a wide hyper-parameter space, including model size, training data
volume, computational budget, architectural configurations, etc. Our empirical
findings reveal a consistent power-law relationship between RankMe and
representation quality, suggesting that embedding effective rank serves as a
reliable proxy for assessing and predicting model performance in audio
representation learning. This work not only validates the applicability of
classical scaling principles to the general audio domain but also offers a
theoretically grounded and empirically robust framework for guiding future
model scaling strategies in audio foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法衡量恢复保真度：合成数据集使用未处理音轨但不真实，而真实制作数据集只有已处理音轨缺乏干净参考。需要专门基准来评估音乐源恢复任务。

Method: 构建MSRBench基准，包含八个乐器类别的原始音轨-混音对，混音由专业混音师制作。添加12种真实世界退化效果，包括模拟伪影、声学环境和有损编解码器。使用U-Net和BSRNN作为基线模型进行实验。

Result: 基线实验结果显示U-Net和BSRNN分别达到-37.8 dB和-23.4 dB的SI-SNR，感知质量(FAD CLAP)约为0.7-0.8，表明仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: MSRBench填补了音乐源恢复评估的空白，基线结果显示了改进的必要性，需要专门针对恢复任务的架构设计。

Abstract: Music Source Restoration (MSR) extends source separation to realistic
settings where signals undergo production effects (equalization, compression,
reverb) and real-world degradations, with the goal of recovering the original
unprocessed sources. Existing benchmarks cannot measure restoration fidelity:
synthetic datasets use unprocessed stems but unrealistic mixtures, while real
production datasets provide only already-processed stems without clean
references. We present MSRBench, the first benchmark explicitly designed for
MSR evaluation. MSRBench contains raw stem-mixture pairs across eight
instrument classes, where mixtures are produced by professional mixing
engineers. These raw-processed pairs enable direct evaluation of both
separation accuracy and restoration fidelity. Beyond controlled studio
conditions, the mixtures are augmented with twelve real-world degradations
spanning analog artifacts, acoustic environments, and lossy codecs. Baseline
experiments with U-Net and BSRNN achieve SI-SNR of -37.8 dB and -23.4 dB
respectively, with perceptual quality (FAD CLAP) around 0.7-0.8, demonstrating
substantial room for improvement and the need for restoration-specific
architectures.

Result: 对代表性LALMs的实验揭示了显著的性能差距，并指出了未来改进方向。

Conclusion: VCB Bench提供了一个可复现的细粒度评估框架，为推进中文语音对话模型提供了标准化方法和实践见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have greatly enhanced
multimodal conversational systems. However, existing benchmarks remain limited
-- they are mainly English-centric, rely on synthetic speech, and lack
comprehensive, discriminative evaluation across multiple dimensions. To address
these gaps, we present Voice Chat Bot Bench (VCB Bench) -- a high-quality
Chinese benchmark built entirely on real human speech. VCB Bench evaluates
LALMs from three complementary perspectives: instruction following (including
speech-level control beyond text commands), knowledge understanding (general
knowledge, reasoning, and daily dialogue), and robustness (stability under
perturbations in content, environment, and speaker traits). Experiments on
representative LALMs reveal notable performance gaps and highlight future
directions for improvement. VCB Bench provides a reproducible and fine-grained
evaluation framework, offering standardized methodology and practical insights
for advancing Chinese voice conversational models.

TL;DR: EMM-TTS是一个基于扰动自监督学习表示的两阶段跨语言情感语音合成框架，通过显式和隐式编码韵律线索来捕捉情感表达，同时从扰动表示中恢复音色，实现了对情感、音色和语言的细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言情感文本转语音面临情感和音色在语音信号中高度纠缠的挑战，难以实现细粒度控制。需要开发能够有效解耦情感和音色的方法。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段显式和隐式编码韵律线索捕捉情感表达；第二阶段从扰动的SSL表示中恢复音色。引入说话人一致性损失和说话人-情感自适应层归一化模块，结合显式声学特征和预训练潜在特征。

Result: 通过全面的多指标评估（包括主观和客观测量），EMM-TTS在跨语言场景下实现了优越的自然度、情感传递性和音色一致性。

Conclusion: EMM-TTS通过创新的两阶段设计和扰动策略，成功解决了跨语言情感语音合成中情感和音色解耦的挑战，为多语言情感语音生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-lingual emotional text-to-speech (TTS) aims to produce speech in one
language that captures the emotion of a speaker from another language while
maintaining the target voice's timbre. This process of cross-lingual emotional
speech synthesis presents a complex challenge, necessitating flexible control
over emotion, timbre, and language. However, emotion and timbre are highly
entangled in speech signals, making fine-grained control challenging. To
address this issue, we propose EMM-TTS, a novel two-stage cross-lingual
emotional speech synthesis framework based on perturbed self-supervised
learning (SSL) representations. In the first stage, the model explicitly and
implicitly encodes prosodic cues to capture emotional expressiveness, while the
second stage restores the timbre from perturbed SSL representations. We further
investigate the effect of different speaker perturbation strategies-formant
shifting and speaker anonymization-on the disentanglement of emotion and
timbre. To strengthen speaker preservation and expressive control, we introduce
Speaker Consistency Loss (SCL) and Speaker-Emotion Adaptive Layer Normalization
(SEALN) modules. Additionally, we find that incorporating explicit acoustic
features (e.g., F0, energy, and duration) alongside pretrained latent features
improves voice cloning performance. Comprehensive multi-metric evaluations,
including both subjective and objective measures, demonstrate that EMM-TTS
achieves superior naturalness, emotion transferability, and timbre consistency
across languages.

Motivation: 解决音频-文本模态差距问题，提升多模态编码器与大语言模型耦合的效果

Method: 使用基于扩散的模态桥接模块，将音频嵌入生成式映射到文本嵌入分布，采用轻量级残差MLP网络结构

Result: 在模态差距分析中表现最佳，在AudioCaps数据集上零样本和全监督描述任务分别实现52.5%和7.5%的相对提升

Conclusion: 缩小模态差距对多模态编码器与LLM的有效耦合至关重要，扩散式模态桥接是超越知识检索中心设计的有效方法

Abstract: Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations,
yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling
multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present
Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively
maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is
trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and
implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess
the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on
Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first
application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results.
(1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link
reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows
a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2)
Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline
achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised
captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and
7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is
pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and
diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond
knowledge-retrieval-centric designs. Code will be released upon acceptance

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown strong
capabilities in audio understanding. However, most systems rely solely on
end-to-end reasoning, limiting interpretability and accuracy for tasks that

Abstract: Sampling, the technique of reusing pieces of existing audio tracks to create
new music content, is a very common practice in modern music production. In
this paper, we tackle the challenging task of automatic sample identification,
that is, detecting such sampled content and retrieving the material from which
it originates. To do so, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach that
leverages a multi-track dataset to create positive pairs of artificial mixes,
and design a novel contrastive learning objective. We show that such method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, that is robust
to various genres, and that scales well when increasing the number of noise
songs in the reference database. In addition, we extensively analyze the
contribution of the different components of our training pipeline and
highlight, in particular, the need for high-quality separated stems for this
task.

TL;DR: BridgeTTS是一个新型自回归文本转语音框架，通过双语音表示范式BridgeCode解决现有AR-TTS系统的速度-质量权衡和监督不匹配问题，实现高质量快速合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归零样本TTS系统面临两个关键限制：固有的速度-质量权衡（序列标记生成要么降低帧率牺牲表现力，要么丰富标记牺牲效率），以及文本导向的监督不匹配（交叉熵损失均匀惩罚标记错误而不考虑相邻标记间的细粒度声学相似性）。

Method: 基于双语音表示范式BridgeCode，通过预测稀疏标记同时重构丰富的连续特征来减少AR迭代次数，联合优化标记级和特征级目标以增强自然度和可懂度。

Result: 实验表明BridgeTTS在实现竞争性质量和说话人相似度的同时显著加速了合成过程。

Conclusion: BridgeTTS通过双语音表示和联合优化策略，成功解决了AR-TTS系统的速度-质量权衡问题，为高质量快速语音合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) frameworks have recently achieved remarkable progress in
zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) by leveraging discrete speech tokens and large
language model techniques. Despite their success, existing AR-based zero-shot
TTS systems face two critical limitations: (i) an inherent speed-quality
trade-off, as sequential token generation either reduces frame rates at the
cost of expressiveness or enriches tokens at the cost of efficiency, and (ii) a
text-oriented supervision mismatch, as cross-entropy loss penalizes token
errors uniformly without considering the fine-grained acoustic similarity among
adjacent tokens. To address these challenges, we propose BridgeTTS, a novel
AR-TTS framework built upon the dual speech representation paradigm BridgeCode.
BridgeTTS reduces AR iterations by predicting sparse tokens while
reconstructing rich continuous features for high-quality synthesis. Joint
optimization of token-level and feature-level objectives further enhances
naturalness and intelligibility. Experiments demonstrate that BridgeTTS
achieves competitive quality and speaker similarity while significantly
accelerating synthesis. Speech demos are available at

TL;DR: 提出了CLoD-GS框架，将连续细节层次机制集成到3D高斯泼溅表示中，通过距离相关的衰减参数实现平滑的质量缩放，解决了传统离散LoD的存储开销和视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散LoD方法需要存储多个模型副本且会产生视觉"弹出"伪影，而新兴的3D高斯泼溅技术基于显式基元的特性为实现连续LoD提供了理想基础。

Method: 为每个高斯基元引入可学习的距离相关衰减参数，动态调整不透明度；采用虚拟距离缩放机制和从粗到细的训练策略，结合渲染点数量正则化。

Result: CLoD-GS实现了从单一模型的平滑质量可扩展渲染，消除了离散方法的存储开销和视觉伪影，同时减少了基元数量和内存占用。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在3D高斯泼溅表示中实现连续LoD的可行性，为实时计算机图形学中的细节管理提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer
graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving
visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels
(DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at
different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two
major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and
causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the
user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the
emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm:
Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality
scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems
of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a
continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method
introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian
primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity.
This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant
primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one
model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a
virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy
with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the
storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the
primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a
single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of
performance targets.

Conclusion: 提出的接触处理模型成功解决了接触锁定问题，使高分辨率、无相交的织物模拟成为可能，适用于真实世界材料。

Abstract: In this work we analyze and address a fundamental restriction that blocks the
reliable application of codimensional yarn-level and shell models with
thickness, to simulate real-world woven and knit fabrics. As discretizations
refine toward practical and accurate physical modeling, such models can
generate non-physical contact forces with stencil-neighboring elements in the
simulation mesh, leading to severe locking artifacts. While not well-documented
in the literature, this restriction has so far been addressed with two
alternatives with undesirable tradeoffs. One option is to restrict the mesh to
coarse resolutions, however, this eliminates the possibility of accurate (and
consistent) resolution simulations across real-world material variations. A
second alternative instead seeks to cull contact pairs that can create such
locking forces in the first place. This relaxes resolution restrictions but
compromise robustness. Culling can and will generate unacceptable and
unpredictable geometric intersections and tunneling that destroys weaving and
knitting structures and cause unrecoverable pull-throughs. We address these
challenges to simulating real-world materials with a new and practical
contact-processing model for thickened codimensional simulation, that removes
resolution restrictions, while guaranteeing contact-locking-free,
non-intersecting simulations. We demonstrate the application of our model
across a wide range of previously unavailable simulation scenarios, with
real-world material yarn and fabric parameters and patterns, challenging
simulation conditions and mesh resolutions, and both rod and shell models,
integrated with the IPC barrier.

Conclusion: GraphTracer为多智能体系统调试提供了一个强大的解决方案，通过信息依赖分析有效解决了多智能体错误传播中的根本原因识别问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models excel at complex tasks
through coordinated collaboration, yet they face high failure rates in
multi-turn deep search scenarios. Existing temporal attribution methods
struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate
across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing
action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for
information dependencies that span agents. This paper identifies two core
challenges: \textit{(i) distinguishing symptoms from root causes in multi-agent
error propagation}, and \textit{(ii) tracing information dependencies beyond
temporal order}. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GraphTracer}, a
framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis.
GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly
capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root
causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on
temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation
to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on
the Who\&When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate
that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to 18.18\% higher attribution accuracy compared
to state-of-the-art models and enables 4.8\% to 14.2\% performance improvements
in deployed multi-agent frameworks, establishing a robust solution for
multi-agent system debugging.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多智能体系统存在严重的知识冗余问题，智能体在检索和推理过程中重复工作，缺乏确保每个操作阶段共享最小充分信息的机制

Method: 提出D3MAS分层协调框架，包含任务分解、协作推理和分布式内存三个协调层，通过结构化消息传递在统一异质图中实现跨层对齐

Result: 在四个挑战性数据集上的实验显示，D3MAS将推理准确率提高了8.7%到15.6%，平均减少知识冗余46%

Conclusion: D3MAS通过结构设计而非显式优化有效解决了多智能体系统中的知识冗余问题，显著提升了协作效率和推理准确性

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models exhibit strong
capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, these systems suffer
from substantial knowledge redundancy. Agents duplicate efforts in retrieval
and reasoning processes. This inefficiency stems from a deeper issue: current
architectures lack mechanisms to ensure agents share minimal sufficient
information at each operational stage. Empirical analysis reveals an average
knowledge duplication rate of 47.3\% across agent communications. We propose
D3MAS (Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute), a hierarchical coordination
framework addressing redundancy through structural design rather than explicit
optimization. The framework organizes collaboration across three coordinated
layers. Task decomposition filters irrelevant sub-problems early. Collaborative
reasoning captures complementary inference paths across agents. Distributed
memory provides access to non-redundant knowledge. These layers coordinate
through structured message passing in a unified heterogeneous graph. This
cross-layer alignment ensures information remains aligned with actual task
needs. Experiments on four challenging datasets show that D3MAS consistently
improves reasoning accuracy by 8.7\% to 15.6\% and reduces knowledge redundancy
by 46\% on average.

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples
that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to
extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist
in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image
diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match
user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing
approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of
image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or
require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model
fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a
training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation
while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a
vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the
generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual
concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We
evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical
metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show
consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead.
Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our
approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of
creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional
prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines,
offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond
the constraints of textual descriptions.

Conclusion: 这是首个将结构感知整合到优化过程中的框架，产生了具有优越几何保真度、拓扑正确性和显式结构分解的中轴网格

Abstract: We propose a novel optimization framework for computing the medial axis
transform that simultaneously preserves the medial structure and ensures high
medial mesh quality. The medial structure, consisting of interconnected sheets,
seams, and junctions, provides a natural volumetric decomposition of a 3D
shape. Our method introduces a structure-aware, particle-based optimization
pipeline guided by the restricted power diagram (RPD), which partitions the
input volume into convex cells whose dual encodes the connectivity of the
medial mesh. Structure-awareness is enforced through a spherical quadratic
error metric (SQEM) projection that constrains the movement of medial spheres,
while a Gaussian kernel energy encourages an even spatial distribution.
Compared to feature-preserving methods such as MATFP and MATTopo, our approach
produces cleaner and more accurate medial structures with significantly
improved mesh quality. In contrast to voxel-based, point-cloud-based, and
variational methods, our framework is the first to integrate structural
awareness into the optimization process, yielding medial meshes with superior
geometric fidelity, topological correctness, and explicit structural
decomposition.

### [704] [A Hybrid Agent-Based and System Dynamics Framework for Modelling Project Execution and Technology Maturity in Early-Stage R&D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09688)
*R. W. S. Pessoa,M. H. Næss,J. C. Bijos,C. M. Rebello,D. Colombo,L. Schnitman,I. B. R. Nogueira*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合系统动力学和基于代理建模的混合方法来预测研发项目中技术成熟度的演变，以石油天然气行业为例，能够捕捉工作投入、团队规模和项目持续时间等不确定性因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AB-SD混合模型在其他领域已有应用，但在研发领域的应用仍然有限。需要一种能够同时考虑系统层面反馈结构和分散代理交互的框架来更好地理解研发项目动态。

Method: 开发了一个多层次框架，将系统层面的工作阶段、返工周期和持续时间反馈结构与分散的代理（团队成员、任务和控制器）相结合，通过代理交互产生涌现的项目动态。

Result: 基础案例分析显示15个并行任务在156周内的早期创新项目。比较顺序场景显示返工持续时间减少88%。在并行配置中，增加团队规模减少了项目持续时间并提高了任务完成率，4-5人团队表现最佳。

Conclusion: 模型输出与专家理解一致，支持其作为分析资源分配、调度效率和技术成熟度进展的定量工具的有效性。中等团队规模扩展能提高协调效率而不会产生过多沟通开销。

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid approach to predict the evolution of
technological maturity in R and D projects, using the oil and gas sector as an
example. Integrating System Dynamics (SD) and Agent Based Modelling (ABM)
allows the proposed multi level framework to capture uncertainties in work
effort, team size, and project duration, which influence technological
progress. While AB SD hybrid models are established in other fields, their use
in R and D remains limited. The model combines system level feedback structures
governing work phases, rework cycles, and duration with decentralised agents
such as team members, tasks, and controllers, whose interactions generate
emergent project dynamics. A base case scenario analysed early stage innovation
projects with 15 parallel tasks over 156 weeks. A comparative sequential
scenario showed an 88 percent reduction in rework duration. A second scenario
assessed mixed parallel sequential task structures with varying team sizes. In
parallel configurations, increasing team size reduced project duration and
improved task completion, with optimal results for teams of four to five
members. These findings align with empirical evidence showing that moderate
team expansion enhances coordination efficiency without excessive communication
overhead. However, larger teams may decrease performance due to communication
complexity and management delays. Overall, the model outputs and framework
align with expert understanding, supporting their validity as quantitative
tools for analysing resource allocation, scheduling efficiency, and technology
maturity progression.

### [705] [Structured Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: a Bayesian Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09937)
*Shahbaz P Qadri Syed,He Bai*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用智能体间耦合结构的高效多智能体强化学习方法，通过贝叶斯网络建模价值依赖关系，并开发了部分去中心化训练去中心化执行(P-DTDE)框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的多智能体强化学习算法未能充分利用智能体间的耦合信息来开发更高效和可扩展的算法。

Method: 通过贝叶斯网络建模合作型MARL问题，识别价值依赖集，提出P-DTDE训练范式，并开发基于此的可扩展actor-critic算法。对于密集依赖集，提出基于贝叶斯网络截断的近似方案。

Result: 理论证明P-DTDE策略梯度估计器的总方差小于集中训练去中心化执行(CTDE)估计器。在多仓库资源分配和多区域温度控制示例中验证了算法的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用智能体间耦合结构，在保持性能的同时提高多智能体强化学习的效率和可扩展性，特别是对于大规模智能体系统。

Abstract: The empirical success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has
motivated the search for more efficient and scalable algorithms for large scale
multi-agent systems. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms do not fully
exploit inter-agent coupling information to develop MARL algorithms. In this
paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage structures in the
inter-agent couplings for efficient model-free reinforcement learning. We model
the cooperative MARL problem via a Bayesian network and characterize the subset
of agents, termed as the value dependency set, whose information is required by
each agent to estimate its local action value function exactly. Moreover, we
propose a partially decentralized training decentralized execution (P-DTDE)
paradigm based on the value dependency set. We theoretically establish that the
total variance of our P-DTDE policy gradient estimator is less than the
centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient estimator.
We derive a multi-agent policy gradient theorem based on the P-DTDE scheme and
develop a scalable actor-critic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and
scalability of the proposed algorithm on multi-warehouse resource allocation
and multi-zone temperature control examples. For dense value dependency sets,
we propose an approximation scheme based on truncation of the Bayesian network
and empirically show that it achieves a faster convergence than the exact value
dependence set for applications with a large number of agents.

*Walid Abdela*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: KG-MAS是一个基于知识图谱的多智能体基础设施，通过集中式知识图谱作为共享世界模型，解决工业4.0中物理与数字环境集成的异构性和复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖僵化的数据驱动解决方案，缺乏语义丰富性和灵活性，难以实现智能自主协调。

Method: 利用集中式知识图谱作为动态共享世界模型，支持多智能体系统；采用模型驱动架构自动从语义描述生成智能体。

Result: 提供了一个统一、智能的协调机制，抽象底层通信协议，实现了异构物理和数字机器人环境的稳健、可扩展和灵活耦合。

Conclusion: KG-MAS为工业4.0中的系统集成提供了有效的解决方案，通过知识图谱和多智能体系统的结合解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: The seamless integration of physical and digital environments in
Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS), particularly within Industry 4.0, presents
significant challenges stemming from system heterogeneity and complexity.
Traditional approaches often rely on rigid, data-centric solutions like
co-simulation frameworks or brittle point-to-point middleware bridges, which
lack the semantic richness and flexibility required for intelligent, autonomous
coordination. This report introduces the Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent
Infrastructure(KG-MAS), as resolution in addressing such limitations. KG-MAS
leverages a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) as a dynamic, shared world model,
providing a common semantic foundation for a Multi-Agent System(MAS).
Autonomous agents, representing both physical and digital components, query
this KG for decision-making and update it with real-time state information. The
infrastructure features a model-driven architecture which facilitates the
automatic generation of agents from semantic descriptions, thereby simplifying
system extension and maintenance. By abstracting away underlying communication
protocols and providing a unified, intelligent coordination mechanism, KG-MAS
offers a robust, scalable, and flexible solution for coupling heterogeneous
physical and digital robotic environments.

### [707] [HyperAgent: Leveraging Hypergraphs for Topology Optimization in Multi-Agent Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10611)
*Heng Zhang,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Zijian Zhang,Haochen You,Lubin Gan,Yilei Yuan,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了HyperAgent框架，使用超图结构优化多智能体系统的通信拓扑，通过超边直接表示组协作模式，并动态调整拓扑以适应任务复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要问题：(i) 基于图的边表示无法有效建模多智能体间的群体协作关系；(ii) 通信拓扑设计缺乏任务适应性，导致简单任务通信成本过高，复杂场景协调不足。

Method: 使用超边连接同一子任务中的多个智能体，通过超图卷积层实现协作组的一步信息聚合，并采用变分自编码器框架和稀疏正则化动态调整超图拓扑。

Result: 在GSM8K上达到95.07%的准确率，同时减少25.33%的token消耗，在性能和效率方面均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 基于超图的优化方法在多智能体通信中具有巨大潜力，能够有效平衡协作效率和通信成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model-powered multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable collective intelligence through effective
communication. However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: (i)
\textit{Ineffective group collaboration modeling}, as they rely on pairwise
edge representations in graph structures, limiting their ability to capture
relationships among multiple agents; and (ii) \textit{Limited task-adaptiveness
in communication topology design}, leading to excessive communication cost for
simple tasks and insufficient coordination for complex scenarios. These issues
restrict the scalability and practical deployment of adaptive collaboration
frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{HyperAgent}, a
hypergraph-based framework that optimizes communication topologies and
effectively captures group collaboration patterns using direct hyperedge
representations. Unlike edge-based approaches, HyperAgent uses hyperedges to
link multiple agents within the same subtask and employs hypergraph
convolutional layers to achieve one-step information aggregation in
collaboration groups. Additionally, it incorporates a variational autoencoder
framework with sparsity regularization to dynamically adjust hypergraph
topologies based on task complexity. Experiments highlight the superiority of
HyperAgent in both performance and efficiency. For instance, on GSM8K,
HyperAgent achieves 95.07\% accuracy while reducing token consumption by
25.33\%, demonstrating the potential of hypergraph-based optimization for
multi-agent communication.

### [708] [Fast and the Furious: Hot Starts in Pursuit-Evasion Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10830)
*Gabriel Smithline,Scott Nivison*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合博弈论控制理论和图神经网络的方法，用于在追逃游戏中有效定位追捕者，无需事先知道逃避者位置。通过将追捕者配置表示为图结构，构建图特征空间并训练图卷积网络生成战略有效的初始配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在追逃游戏中，缺乏逃避者位置先验知识的情况下有效定位追捕者是一个重大挑战。需要开发能够在未知环境中智能部署追捕者的方法。

Method: 将追捕者配置概念化为战略安排并表示为图结构，通过多目标优化构建图特征空间识别帕累托最优配置，训练图卷积网络生成战略有效的初始配置（热启动）。

Result: 经验评估表明，GCN生成的热启动配置相比随机配置具有显著优势。在多追捕者-逃避者场景中，该方法加速了逃避者生存率下降，减少了追捕者移动距离，增强了围困效果。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了将博弈论控制理论与图神经网络结合在追逃游戏中的战略优势，为未知环境中的智能追捕者部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Effectively positioning pursuers in pursuit-evasion games without prior
knowledge of evader locations remains a significant challenge. A novel approach
that combines game-theoretic control theory with Graph Neural Networks is
introduced in this work. By conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic
arrangements and representing them as graphs, a Graph Characteristic Space is
constructed via multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal
configurations. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on these
Pareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial
configurations, termed "hot starts". Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the
GCN-generated hot starts provide a significant advantage over random
configurations. In scenarios considering multiple pursuers and evaders, this
method hastens the decline in evader survival rates, reduces pursuer travel
distances, and enhances containment, showcasing clear strategic benefits.

### [709] [The Social Cost of Intelligence: Emergence, Propagation, and Amplification of Stereotypical Bias in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10943)
*Thi-Nhung Nguyen,Linhao Luo,Thuy-Trang Vu,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了多智能体系统中大语言模型的偏见问题，发现多智能体系统通常比单智能体系统更容易产生偏见，但合作和辩论式沟通可以缓解偏见放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的兴起，多个大语言模型协作和通信时会产生新的偏见传播动态，这是之前研究较少关注的领域。

Method: 通过模拟不同社会群体代表的智能体在各种交互和对抗场景下的行为，在三个偏见基准测试上进行实验。

Result: 实验显示多智能体系统通常比单智能体系统更不稳健，偏见往往通过群体内偏袒早期出现，但合作和辩论式沟通可以缓解偏见放大。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了影响多智能体大语言模型系统公平性和韧性的关键因素，更稳健的基础大语言模型能提高整体系统稳定性。

Abstract: Bias in large language models (LLMs) remains a persistent challenge,
manifesting in stereotyping and unfair treatment across social groups. While
prior research has primarily focused on individual models, the rise of
multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple LLMs collaborate and communicate,
introduces new and largely unexplored dynamics in bias emergence and
propagation. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of stereotypical
bias in MAS, examining how internal specialization, underlying LLMs and
inter-agent communication protocols influence bias robustness, propagation, and
amplification. We simulate social contexts where agents represent different
social groups and evaluate system behavior under various interaction and
adversarial scenarios. Experiments on three bias benchmarks reveal that MAS are
generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early
through in-group favoritism. However, cooperative and debate-based
communication can mitigate bias amplification, while more robust underlying
LLMs improve overall system stability. Our findings highlight critical factors
shaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.

*Haoran Liang,Yufa Zhou,Mohammad Talebi Kalaleh,Qipei Mei*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MASSE是首个用于结构工程的多智能体系统，通过基于大语言模型的智能体与真实工程工作流集成，实现了结构工程任务的自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构工程作为基础但传统停滞的领域，核心工作流几十年未变，尽管具有重大经济影响。大语言模型在复杂推理、长期规划和精确工具使用方面的进步与结构工程任务高度契合。

Method: 采用无需训练的基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够解释设计规范、执行荷载计算和验证结构承载力。

Result: 验证显示MASSE能将专家工作量从约2小时减少到几分钟，同时在真实工程场景中提高可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: MASSE证明大多数真实世界结构工程工作流可以通过多智能体系统完全自动化，并能在专业环境中立即部署。

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{MASSE}$, the first Multi-Agent System for Structural
Engineering, effectively integrating large language model (LLM)-based agents
with real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental
yet traditionally stagnant domain, with core workflows remaining largely
unchanged for decades despite its substantial economic impact and global market
size. Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to
perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization
-- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as
interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying
structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most
real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a
training-free LLM-based multi-agent system. MASSE enables immediate deployment
in professional environments, and our comprehensive validation on real-world
case studies demonstrates that it can reduce expert workload from approximately
two hours to mere minutes, while enhancing both reliability and accuracy in
practical engineering scenarios.

### [711] [A Vision for Access Control in LLM-based Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11108)
*Xinfeng Li,Dong Huang,Jie Li,Hongyi Cai,Zhenhong Zhou,Wei Dong,XiaoFeng Wang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出Agent Access Control (AAC)框架，将传统访问控制重构为动态、上下文感知的信息流治理过程，以应对LLM智能体的自主性和复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态、基于规则的访问控制机制无法有效管理LLM智能体交互中的动态信息流，需要从二元权限控制转向更复杂的信息治理模式。

Method: AAC框架包含两个核心模块：多维上下文评估（评估身份、关系、场景和规范）和自适应响应制定（超越简单的允许/拒绝决策，通过编辑、摘要和改写来塑造信息）。

Result: 提出了由专用AC推理引擎驱动的AAC愿景，旨在弥合人类细致判断与可扩展AI安全之间的差距。

Conclusion: AAC为可信智能体设计的未来研究提供了一个新的概念视角，强调信息流治理而非简单的权限控制。

Abstract: The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional
access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems
designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage
the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position
paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more
sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge
is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We
introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a
dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on
two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses
not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2)
adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions
to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This
vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap
between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new
conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.

*Anastasia Psarou,Łukasz Gorczyca,Dominik Gaweł,Rafał Kucharski*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 在自动驾驶车辆的路由游戏中引入基于边际成本的奖励信号，可以显著减少训练时间并提高收敛可靠性，同时改善系统整体和个人性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当多个自私的自动驾驶车辆使用多智能体强化学习学习最优路由策略时，可能会破坏交通系统的稳定性，因为它们需要很长时间才能收敛到最优解。

Method: 通过在奖励函数中引入基于边际成本矩阵的内在奖励信号，量化每个个体动作对系统的影响，从而减少非平稳性并协调智能体目标。

Result: 实验表明，使用新奖励公式训练的MARL算法能够收敛到最优解，而基线算法无法做到。在玩具网络和真实世界的Saint-Arnoult网络中均验证了效果。

Conclusion: 社会意识（即在路由决策中包含边际成本）可以改善未来城市系统中自动驾驶车辆的系统范围和个人性能。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that when multiple selfish Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
are introduced to future cities and start learning optimal routing strategies
using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), they may destabilize traffic
systems, as they would require a significant amount of time to converge to the
optimal solution, equivalent to years of real-world commuting.
  We demonstrate that moving beyond the selfish component in the reward
significantly relieves this issue. If each AV, apart from minimizing its own
travel time, aims to reduce its impact on the system, this will be beneficial
not only for the system-wide performance but also for each individual player in
this routing game.
  By introducing an intrinsic reward signal based on the marginal cost matrix,
we significantly reduce training time and achieve convergence more reliably.
Marginal cost quantifies the impact of each individual action (route-choice) on
the system (total travel time). Including it as one of the components of the
reward can reduce the degree of non-stationarity by aligning agents'
objectives. Notably, the proposed counterfactual formulation preserves the
system's equilibria and avoids oscillations.
  Our experiments show that training MARL algorithms with our novel reward
formulation enables the agents to converge to the optimal solution, whereas the
baseline algorithms fail to do so. We show these effects in both a toy network
and the real-world network of Saint-Arnoult. Our results optimistically
indicate that social awareness (i.e., including marginal costs in routing
decisions) improves both the system-wide and individual performance of future
urban systems with AVs.
