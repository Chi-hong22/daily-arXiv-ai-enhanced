*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了不依赖真实训练数据的水下3D物体检测方法，通过物理模拟咃比匹配两种方案在泥海真实数据上进行对比。结果显示模板匹配方法在真实场景中表现更为稳健，达到83% mAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下3D物体检测面临训练数据稀缺咃标注成本高的挑战。传统深度学习方法需要大量标注过的声纳数据，而获取这些数据成本昂贵且逻辑复杂。本文旨在解决如何在不依赖真实训练数据的情况下实现可靠的水下3D检测。

Method: 采用双重方案：1）基于物理的声纳模拟流水生成合成训练数据，用于训练最新神经网络；2）基于模型的模板匹配系统，利用目标物体的几何先验知识。在泥海真实测渗数据上进行评估对比。

Result: 评测结果显示：在模拟场景中，神经网络达到98% mAP，但在真实声纳数据上下降到40% mAP（培基偏移影响）。相反，模板匹配方法在不需要任何训练的情况下保持83% mAP，对声学噪声咃环境变化表现出显著的稳健性。

Conclusion: 这项研究挑战了水下领域深度学习需要大量数据的传统观念，并建立了首个大规模的无训练水下3D检测基准。研究成果为自主水下载具导航、海洋考古学咃离岸基础设施监测等数据稀缺环境开启了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileDenseAttn是一种融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流模型，用于脑肿瘤MRI检测，在6020个MRI扫描数据集上达到98.35%的测试准确率，比基线模型准确率提升3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%，并通过GradCAM提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑肿瘤MRI检测方法存在局限性：泛化能力差、计算效率低、缺乏可解释性和透明度，限制了临床可信度。需要开发一种既能提高检测性能又能提供可视化解释的通用模型。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn模型，融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流架构，采用特征级融合策略。在包含胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和正常样本的6020个MRI扫描增强数据集上进行训练，使用5折交叉验证协议。

Result: 模型训练准确率99.75%，测试准确率98.35%，F1分数0.9835（95%置信区间：0.9743-0.9920）。相比基线模型VGG19，准确率提升3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热图清晰显示肿瘤区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一个高效、高性能、可解释的模型，具有成为临床实用工具的潜力，能够在真实世界中有效识别脑肿瘤。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在视觉实体识别方面存在系统性缺陷，当通过图像而非文本引用实体时，模型回忆事实知识的能力显著下降，这种缺陷可以通过内部状态探测来检测和缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面的系统性缺陷，特别是当实体通过视觉而非文本方式呈现时，模型回忆事实知识能力显著下降的问题。

Method: 通过受控研究分析VLMs的表现差异，开发基于模型内部状态的探测方法（准确率超过92%），用于识别模型不可靠响应的情况，并在视觉问答任务中应用选择性预测。

Result: 当VLMs依赖图像表示时，回忆事实知识的能力下降一半；内部状态探测能有效识别不可靠响应；在视觉问答任务中，选择性预测使覆盖率提高7.87%，错误风险降低0.9%。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型存在可检测的系统性缺陷，内部状态探测是有效的识别工具，解决这种缺陷对语言基础化研究具有重要意义，为未来研究方向提供了建设性建议。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

### [4] [SERES: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction from sparse views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18314)
*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种基于语义感知的神经重建方法，通过补丁语义预测与形状正则化，从稀疏图像生成高保真3D模型，在DTU数据集上显著提升重建精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏图像输入中特征不匹配导致的严重光照歧彺问题

Method: 在神经隐式表示中添加补丁语义预测值，与距离场和光照场一起优化，并使用基于几何原始面具的新额正则化方法

Result: 在DTU数据集上，对SparseNeuS和VolRecon的平均Chamfer距离分别减少44%和20%；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo的插件，平均误差分别减少69%和68%

Conclusion: 语义感知信息能有效减少稀疏视角下的重建歧彺，提高了3D重建的精度和保真度

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [Automated Landfill Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study of Lightweight and Custom Architectures with the AerialWaste Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18315)
*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用轻量级深度学习模型和集成学习方法，在AerialWaste数据集上实现非法垃圾填埋场检测，达到92.33%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球环境和人类健康构成严重威胁，但人工识别困难且公开数据集稀缺。需要开发自动化检测方法来节省时间和资源。

Method: 使用轻量级深度学习模型（Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等）避免过拟合，并采用集成融合技术结合最佳模型。

Result: 在AerialWaste数据集上实现二分类：准确率92.33%、精确率92.67%、灵敏度92.33%、F1分数92.41%、特异性92.71%。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成学习能有效检测非法垃圾填埋场，避免复杂模型的过拟合问题，为环境监测提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSU框架，通过模态特定图结构和跨模态语义锚点，解决多模态情感分析中的结构依赖和语义对齐问题，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视模态特定结构依赖和语义错位，限制了质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: SSU框架：动态构建模态特定图（文本用语法，音视频用文本引导注意力机制），引入基于文本语义的跨模态对齐锚点，采用多视图对比学习目标

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上达到最先进性能，显著降低计算开销，定性分析验证了可解释性和情感模式捕捉能力

Conclusion: SSU通过系统整合结构信息和语义对齐，有效提升了多模态情感分析的性能、效率和可解释性

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个快速、前馈的3D高斯泼溅框架，能够从任意姿态的单张人脸图像在10毫秒内生成3DGS模型，具有优异的重建质量和身份保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS人脸生成方法要么需要逐人优化（速度慢），要么前馈方法重建质量不足。需要一种既能快速生成又能保持高质量重建的解决方案。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络设计，首先构建3DGS人脸模板模型，然后编码输入图像为身份特定、姿态不变的潜在嵌入，解码后预测模板高斯参数残差。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），比逐人优化方法快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar结合了优异的重建质量和速度，扩展了3DGS在消费级和交互式系统中逼真头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种直接生成大规模3D驾驶场景的方法，结合代理几何生成和2D图像先验的分数蒸馏，实现了高可控性和几何一致性的3D场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经重建方法受限于静态环境和有限的场景控制，而基于扩散模型的生成方法缺乏几何基础和因果性。需要一种能够生成具有准确几何和因果性的大规模3D驾驶场景的方法。

Method: 结合代理几何生成和环境表示，利用学习到的2D图像先验进行分数蒸馏，支持基于地图布局的条件生成。

Result: 该方法能够生成具有高保真纹理和结构的几何一致3D驾驶场景，支持提示引导的几何生成和因果性新视角合成。

Conclusion: 该方法成功填补了现有方法的空白，实现了可控性强、几何准确的大规模3D驾驶场景生成，为机器人学习提供了高质量的合成数据。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

*Giuseppe Stragapede,Sam Merrick,Vedrana Krivokuća Hahn,Justin Sukaitis,Vincent Graf Narbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种适用于人道主义和紧急情况的移动生物识别系统，采用PolyProtect模板保护方案，在保证识别准确性的同时提高数据主体的隐私安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人道主义和紧急情况下使用生物识别技术虽然提高效率，但对于弱势群体带来严重的数据风险，需要一种方案来平衡效率与安全性。

Method: 通过对生物识别模板保护（BTP）方案的深入对比分析，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络面部嵌入表示。该方法运行在EdgeFace特征提取器上，并在耳立比亚的实际人道地项面部数据集上进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示PolyProtect在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和非链接性方面表现漂亮，同时还在指纹生物识别中展现出良好的模态独立性。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种高效、轻量级且模块化的BTP方案，适用于人道主义和紧急情况下的生物识别系统，能在保证操作效率的同时有效保护数据主体隐私。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [10] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文主张在视觉基础模型中引入显式关系接口（动态关系图）来增强关系推理能力，通过轻量级图推理模块改善细粒度语义保真度、鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在处理需要显式实体、角色和时空关系推理的任务时存在局限性，而关系能力对于细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析等任务至关重要。

Method: 通过在基础模型中集成轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块，构建动态关系图（图的拓扑结构和边语义从输入和任务上下文中推断），实现稀疏的语义节点推理。

Result: 实验表明，与纯基础模型相比，这种混合方法提高了细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率，同时在内存和硬件效率方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出了FM图混合模型的研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接测试结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的车牌可读性分类数据集LPLC，包含10,210张车辆图片和12,687个注释车牌，用于识别车牌是否需要超分辨率处理或已无法识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动车牌识别中遇到清晰度低的车牌时的识别困难，优化模型性能和计算效率，选择性地应用图像前处理技术。

Method: 构建了一个细粒度注释的数据集，包含车辆和车牌级别的遮挡信息、四个可读性类别以及字符标签。使用三种图像识别网络（ViT、ResNet和YOLO）进行基准分类任务。

Result: 三个基准模型的总体F1分数均低于80%，显示了该任务的高难度，证明需要进一步研究来提高车牌可读性分类的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了车牌可读性分类任务的挑战性，并提供了一个公开的数据集来支持该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一个专家-通才框架，通过结合轻量级皮肤病图像分类器和压缩的视觉语言模型，在皮肤病视觉问答任务中实现了18%的准确率提升和显著的计算效率改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用视觉语言模型在医疗任务中诊断准确性有限、模型过大导致推理成本高的问题，为临床部署提供轻量级、可信赖的AI系统

Method: 采用专家-通才框架：1)轻量级领域训练的图像分类器(专家)提供快速准确的诊断预测；2)压缩的对话式视觉语言模型(通才)生成自然语言解释；3)知识图谱检索模块确保回答的事实准确性

Result: 在皮肤病多模态数据集上，CLARIFY比最强基线(微调未压缩单线VLM)诊断准确率提升18%，平均VRAM需求降低至少20%，延迟降低至少5%

Conclusion: 专家-通才系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a

*Md. Rashid Shahriar Khan,Md. Abrar Hasan,Mohammod Tareq Aziz Justice*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时空建模和视觉语言理解的零样本异常检测框架，无需异常样本训练即可识别监控视频中的异常事件


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件不可预测且高度依赖上下文环境，需要开发能够理解语义上下文并进行零样本检测的方法

Method: 采用混合架构结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型：TimeSformer提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示检测时间偏差，CLIP通过文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并加入上下文门控机制

Result: 开发了一个能够泛化到未见行为的系统，在复杂环境中实现了时空推理和语义上下文理解的结合

Conclusion: 该框架填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理和语义上下文之间的空白，为监控场景中的异常检测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

*Ajinkya Khoche,Qingwen Zhang,Yixi Cai,Sina Sharif Mansouri,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一个自监督的3D场景流估计框架，通过4D雷达多普勒测量生成运动伪标签，无需人工标注即可实现与全监督方法相媲美的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景下性能不足，而全监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展，需要一种无需人工标注的高性能场景流估计方法

Method: 提出跨模态标签转移方法，从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和歧义解析传播将其转移到LiDAR域

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著超越现有自监督方法，仅使用10%的标注数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能

Conclusion: DoGFlow证明了通过跨模态标签转移可以实现高性能的自监督3D场景流估计，解决了人工标注的瓶颈问题

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

TL;DR: SatSkylines是一个从卫星图像和粗略几何先验生成3D建筑的方法，通过建模从噪声粗略先验到详细几何的转换，实现了灵活的几何控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视图中准确恢复建筑结构，而3D细节化方法则过度依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单先验（如长方体）产生满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗略先验到详细几何的转换过程，开发了包含50,000多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines方法成功解决了从卫星图像和简单几何先验生成详细3D建筑的挑战，实现了灵活的几何控制而不增加计算成本。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种两阶段深度学习流水线，用于从单帧游戏界面中检测可穿越空间过渡点（STP）并选择主要过渡点（MSTP），为AI驱动导航和数据驱动关卡设计提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，高效识别地图过渡点对客户端自动地图生成和地图提示效果评估至关重要。这项研究的动机是形式化这一任务并为其设置基准性能指标。

Method: 提出两阶段深度学习流氵线：第一阶段使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在的STP，第二阶段使用轻量级MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征对其进行排名。两个阶段都使用了参数高效的adapter，还包含一个可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在从五款动作RPG游戏收集的多样化数据集上验证了方法。实验结果显示了关键的权衡：当数据充足时，全网络微调可产生更优秀的STP检测结果，而在少数据场景和MSTP选择任务中，adapter-only转移更加稳健和有效。

Conclusion: 这项研究通过定义新题、提供基准流氵线和数据集、以及提供有关高效模型适配的初步见解，为未来的AI驱动导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具做出了贡献。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

TL;DR: Wan-S2V是一个音频驱动的角色动画模型，相比现有方法在电影级动画制作中实现了显著提升的表现力和保真度，特别是在复杂角色互动、身体动作和动态镜头方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动角色动画方法主要适用于语音和歌唱场景，但在需要复杂角色互动、细腻身体动作和动态镜头工作的影视制作中表现不足，无法满足电影级动画需求。

Method: 基于Wan构建的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过改进算法来处理电影级动画的复杂需求，包括角色交互、身体动作和镜头动态等要素。

Result: 在Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等先进模型的对比实验中，Wan-S2V始终显著优于现有解决方案，同时在长视频生成和精确视频唇形同步编辑等应用中展现出良好的通用性。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V成功解决了实现电影级角色动画的长期挑战，为复杂影视制作提供了高质量的音频驱动动画解决方案，在表达力和保真度方面实现了显著提升。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

TL;DR: 本文提出DeReF框架，通过随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合，解决多模态癌症生存分析中的特征融合问题，在多个数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态癌症生存分析方法遇到两个主要挑战：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合，而MoE融合中各专家网络处理分离特征限制了信息交互。

Method: 提出DeReF框架，包含随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块，同时在模态解耦模块中集成区域交叉注意力网络来提升解耦特征的表示质量。

Result: 在自建的肝癌数据集和三个TCGA公共数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过随机重组策略增加了特征组合的多样性和粒度，充分利用了解耦特征间的信息交互，为多模态癌症生存分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个视频对象移除框架，专门处理对象移除后的副作用（阴影、反射、光线、半透明和镜像效果），通过合成数据和扩散变换器实现高质量的视频修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（如阴影、反射等）时表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏成对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器构建视频修复模型；通过参考式擦除定位所有对象相关区域；引入额外监督显式预测副作用影响区域。

Result: ROSE在各类副作用移除任务上表现优异，优于现有视频对象擦除模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Conclusion: ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据生成，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和完整性，为视频编辑提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，模型往往过度强调一个方面而忽视另一个方面，导致生成的字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：构建HMD-270K数据集，采用Motion-Detail Fusion和Fine-Grained Examination两阶段流程；2) 优化层面：基于Group Relative Policy Optimization提出Caption Set Equivalence Reward，通过unit-to-set匹配和双向验证提升完整性和准确性。

Result: OwlCap在细节导向的VDC基准上Acc提升4.2，在运动导向的DREAM-1K基准上F1提升4.6，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的HMD-270K数据集和CSER优化方法有效解决了视频字幕生成中的运动-细节不平衡问题，OwlCap模型在多个基准测试中表现出色，将公开发布以促进视频字幕研究社区发展。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的水下图像增强方法在空间域使用SNR先验存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面帮助有限

Method: 提出在频域使用SNR先验，将特征分解为幅度和相位谱；设计傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)结合频谱交互和SNR线索；频率自适应变换器(FAT)瓶颈通过门控注意力机制融合低频和高频分支；构建统一的U型架构整合传统RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，SFormer相比现有方法获得PSNR 3.1 dB提升和SSIM 0.08提升，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验比空间域方法更有效，提出的SFormer架构通过频谱分解和注意力机制显著提升了水下图像增强的性能

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Motivation: 现有研究在分割性能上表现良好，但在EF估计方面效果不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来改善EF计算准确性

Method: 采用分层设计：低层级使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层级使用Mamba架构捕捉时空关系；提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块通过跨帧和跨位置的跳跃扫描整合长程上下文

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免单帧处理的局部误差累积和多帧处理的细节忽略问题，有助于减轻超声图像噪声等因素导致的EF计算偏差

Conclusion: 分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节建模和全局动态感知，有效改善了超声心动图视频中左心室心内膜分割和EF估计的准确性

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Motivation: 解决人类行为识别系统在计算成本、特征冗余和实时扩展性方面的挑战，适用于智能监控、医疗健康等应用场景。

Method: 集成了自定制InceptionV3提取空间特征，LSTM模型时序依赖，以及采用适应性动态适应度共享和注意力机制的集成遗传算法进行特征选择。

Conclusion: 该框架通过深度学习与特征选择的结合，实现了高准确率和低计算复杂度的平衡，适用于实时边缘计算环境中的人类行为识别。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

TL;DR: ColorGS是一个用于内窥镜视频中可变形组织重建的新框架，通过自适应颜色编码和增强变形建模，在保持实时渲染效率的同时实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配和线性变形建模无法处理复杂纹理和一致的全局变形。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间无关变形，精确捕捉局部组织变形和全局运动一致性。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推动了手术场景重建技术的发展，对术中指导和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在类别不平衡数据集上训练时，模型预测偏向多数类而导致少数类识别性能显著下降的问题。

Method: 扩展洪水正则化到类别级别，根据类别频率为每个类别设置特定的洪水阈值，抑制多数类过拟合的同时允许少数类充分学习。

Result: 在图像分类任务中验证，相比传统洪水正则化方法，提升了少数类的分类性能并获得了更好的整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化是处理类别不平衡问题的有效方法，能够平衡不同类别的学习过程，提高模型在少数类上的表现。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ADM（对抗难度度量）方法，结合课程学习和SAM训练，通过测量原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差距来评估样本难度，解决在平坦区域中传统难度度量失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习基于损失值或梯度范数评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些度量变得无效，导致难以有效结合课程学习和SAM训练。

Method: 提出ADM度量方法，利用平坦最小值模型的鲁棒性特性，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本之间的归一化损失差距来量化对抗脆弱性，并将其集成到基于课程学习的SAM训练中。

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域泛化任务上的实验表明，该方法同时保留了课程学习和SAM的优势，超越了现有的基于课程和平坦性感知的训练策略。

Conclusion: ADM提供了一种在平坦区域中有效评估样本难度的方法，成功实现了课程学习与SAM的有效结合，提高了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析水下目标检测中扇贝类检测性能不佳的问题，发现定位阶段的前景-背景区分是主要瓶颈，分类阶段存在固有特征挑战，建议根据精度或召回率优先选择不同的数据分布策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测面临图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡等独特挑战，不同物种检测性能差异显著但原因不明，需要探究数据量之外的影响因素并系统提升表现不佳的海洋物种检测能力。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，采用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类的定位问题，并通过数据平衡实验研究分类性能差距。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最关键问题且与数据量无关；分类实验显示即使数据平衡后仍存在精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类间依赖的固有特征挑战。

Conclusion: 建议优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回时使用平衡分布；改进表现不佳类别应重点关注算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面；已公开代码和数据集。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Conclusion: PseudoMapTrainer提供了一种经济高效的在线地图训练方法，通过伪标签技术解决了对昂贵真值标注的依赖问题

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at
github.com/boschresearch/PseudoMapTrainer.

Motivation: 现有CAD生成方法主要从点云、网格或文本输入生成模型，但与传统从2D工程图开始的工业工作流程不符，这一关键环节尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出网络友好的矢量图元表示、双解码器Transformer架构（分离命令类型和参数生成）、软目标分布损失函数，并创建CAD-VGDrawing配对数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将CAD生成重新定义为序列到序列学习问题，实现了从2D工程图到参数化CAD模型的精确转换，填补了工业工作流程中的关键空白。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶方法直接从原始数据推导控制命令，但由于深度神经网络的非线性决策边界，解释这些决策具有挑战性，特别是在复杂的城市场景中。需要提高AI决策的可解释性以建立可信赖的AI系统。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地在优化控制命令的同时增强了自动驾驶模型的可解释性，证明了可解释性与安全性之间的正相关关系，为可信赖AI在自动驾驶领域的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Motivation: 现有音视语音识别系统在噪声环境下无法准确估计音频可靠性并动态调整对不同感知模态的依赖程度

Method: 设计了音视频特征融合基础的路由器，通过令牌级音响破坏分数动态重新加权音频和视觉特征，并在每个解码器层中通过门控跨注意力机制强化视觉线索

Result: 在LRS3数据集上实验显示，相比AV-HuBERT系统字符误差率相对减少16.51-42.67%，在真实世界音响噪声条件下显著提升了稳健性

Conclusion: 路由器和门控机制都对提升模型稳健性有积极贡献，该方法能够在音频质量恶化时自动向视觉模态偏移，为噪声环境下的音视语音识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单硬件和软件结合，有效解决了事件相机在静态场景中的使用限制，提供了更可靠的事件数据供下游感知任务使用

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测标准基于严格的类别匹配评价，与生成式VLM的多重合理解释特性不匹配，导致合理预测被错误罚分，需要新的评测方案来公平评估通用VLM专门HOI方法。

Method: 将HOI检测重构为多选题任务，每道题包含真实正确选项和细心构建的负面选项（避免包含合理但未标注的解释），允许多个合理答案并避免正确预测被罚分。

Result: 提出了首个既适用于生成式VLM又适用于专门HOI方法的评测协议，能够直接比较两种方法的表现，为HOI理解领域提供新的见解。

Conclusion: 该新标准有效解决了现有评测方案与生成式VLM之间的不匹配问题，为公平评估不同HOI检测方法提供了基础，推动了HOI理解领域的进步。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Conclusion: CmOS框架成功解决了教育多选题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量多模态教育内容提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare

Conclusion: 本研究通过建立严格基准、引入鲁棒的集成伪标注流程、生成高质量标注数据，为研究社区提供了有效的可扩展标注方案。

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于字体形状与印象标签关系的新型嵌入方法，通过构建印象标签共现图并进行谱嵌入，在印象引导的字体生成任务中优于BERT和CLIP等标准词嵌入方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传达不同的视觉印象，字体形状与描述这些印象的标签之间存在密切关系。现有的标准词嵌入方法（如BERT和CLIP）在处理印象标签时无法有效捕捉这种形状-印象关系。

Method: 构建印象标签共现关系图（节点为印象标签，边编码共现关系），然后应用谱嵌入技术为每个标签生成印象向量。

Result: 在定性和定量评估中，该方法在印象引导的字体生成任务上表现优于BERT和CLIP方法，能够为经常共现的印象标签分配相似的向量表示。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于谱嵌入的印象标签表示方法能够有效捕捉字体形状与印象之间的关系，特别适用于印象驱动的字体生成和检索应用。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

TL;DR: 通过微调领先领域的遥感时间序列基础模型，在少量标注数据下显著提升了荷兰国家森林调查中树种分类的准确性，超过传统方法10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家森林调查需要耗时耗力的现场调查，而遥感技术结合机器学习可以更频繁地更新数据。当前方法主要依赖随机森林分类器和手工设计的物候特征，需要更有效的方案

Method: 使用Google Earth Engine提取Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5和SRTM卫星数据的时间序列，然后微调公开可用的遥感时间序列基础模型，利用其深度特征进行树种分类

Result: 在荷兰国家森林调查分类任务中，新方法比当前最优方法准确性提升了达10%，在所有数据集上都取得了显著改进

Conclusion: 经典的手工设计调和特征对于树种分类任务过于简单，深度AI特征在数据有限的应用中具有巨大潜力。通过利用开政卫星数据和预训练模型，这种方法可以有效补充现有的森林调查过程

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种先验引导的视频级回归方法用于微表情分析，通过可扩展区间选择策略和协同优化框架，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的区间选择策略和协同优化设计，有效解决了微表情分析中的时序动态捕捉问题，显著提升了分析性能

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种通过测试时快速适应的方法来改善像素级合成视频稳定技术，采用性能局部化模块和目标适应策略来提升稳定性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决像素级合成视频稳定方法因国定参数而导致的演续性问题，这些方法虽然能生成全帧输出，但对于不同运动特征和视觉内容的视频序列常常无法稳健地泛化。

Method: 提出一种在测试时快速适应模型到每个输入视频的新方法，利用推理时可用的低级视觉线索来提升输出的稳定性和视觉质量。还提出了性能局部化模块和目标适应策略，重点适应高性能段落以最大化稳定性。

Result: 在多样化的实际数据集上进行了大量实验，证明了该方法的多用性。提出的方法一起一致地改善了各种全帧合成模型的性能，包括在下游应用中的定性和定量结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够使现代稳定器克服长期以来的SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并为用户提供类似于经典方法的控制机制。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，构建近似正交文本锚点引导跨注意力机制，使用超网络生成实例感知视觉提示，并应用基于原型的正则化

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集和4种模态上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下都达到了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医疗影像诊断中的公平性问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了模型公平性

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出了双查询增强网络（DQEN），通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，以及利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询，提升HOI检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询，导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要针对性地增强查询表示。

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，使模型能更有效地关注与对象交互的人类；2) 设计交互语义融合模块，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改善交互特征表示。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: DQEN通过分别增强对象和交互查询，显著提升了HOI检测的准确性和理解能力，证明了针对性查询增强策略的有效性。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将风格驱动和主体驱动生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显对立。作者认为两者可以统一，因为它们都涉及内容与风格的解耦和重组

Method: 1)构建大规模三元组数据集；2)引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并解耦内容；3)加入风格奖励学习(SRL)进一步提升性能；4)发布首个联合评估基准USO-Bench

Result: 大量实验表明USO在开源模型中实现了主体一致性和风格相似性两个维度上的最先进性能

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动的生成任务，证明了通过内容-风格解耦和重组可以实现两者的协同优化

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的NeRF视觉定位方法ppNeSF，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，在保护隐私的同时实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF方法在视觉定位中会编码精细场景细节，存在隐私泄露风险，特别是在云服务部署时敏感信息可能被恢复。

Method: 提出ppNeRF方法：1) 设计新的隐私保护评估协议；2) 使用自监督分割监督替代RGB图像训练NeRF，生成粗粒度但具有判别性的分割空间。

Result: 实验表明传统NeRF的几何表示容易受到隐私攻击，而ppNeSF在保护隐私的同时实现了最先进的视觉定位精度。

Conclusion: ppNeSF通过分割监督成功平衡了隐私保护和定位性能，为NeRF在隐私敏感场景中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在文档视觉问答中引入检索增强生成(RAG)的效果，通过文本和视觉两种检索方式，在多页文档数据集上显著提升了性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面内容，要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，这两种方法都消耗大量内存。RAG提供了一种有吸引力的替代方案，先检索相关片段再生成答案

Method: 使用两种检索变体：基于OCR令牌的文本检索和无需OCR的纯视觉检索，在多个模型和基准测试上进行系统评估，包括MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA数据集

Result: 文本中心变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升高达+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体在不需文本提取的情况下实现+5.0 ANLS改进。检索和重排序组件是主要增益来源

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能够持续提升多页文档VQA的准确性，证明了其在现实应用中的实用价值，而布局引导的分块策略在这些数据集上未能提供帮助

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS是一个用于评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)人口统计偏见的基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色等多个维度，并提出可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的普及，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估方法来发现和量化这些偏见。

Method: 开发GRAS基准测试，包含多种人口统计维度，提出GRAS偏见评分指标，并对5个最先进的VLMs进行偏见评估，同时强调需要从多个问题表述角度评估VQA偏见。

Result: 评估结果显示所有VLMs都存在严重的偏见问题，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分），表明当前模型存在显著的偏见问题。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试揭示了VLMs存在严重的人口统计偏见，强调了多角度问题表述在偏见评估中的重要性，为模型偏见检测和缓解提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RoofSeg网络，一种基于Transformer的端到端屋顶平面分割方法，通过边缘感知模块和几何约束解决当前深度学习方法在边缘精度和几何特征利用方面的不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的屋顶平面分割方法存在三个问题：1）非真正端到端导致结果非最优；2）边缘区域特征判别性低导致边缘不准确；3）平面几何特征未充分约束网络训练

Method: 开发RoofSeg网络，采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询预测实例掩码；设计边缘感知掩码模块（EAMM）融入平面几何先验；提出自适应权重策略和平面几何损失函数

Result: 该方法实现了真正的端到端屋顶平面分割，提高了边缘区域的判别性和分割精度，通过几何约束优化了网络训练效果

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个关键问题，为从LiDAR点云重建LoD 2和3级三维建筑模型提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

TL;DR: 微塑料污染严重，这篇论文提出MicroDetect-Net(MDN)模型，结合莖红染料染色和深度学习检测血液样本中的微塑料粒子，达到92%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料污染已成为全球急诫问题，对人体健康造成严重威胁。需要有效的检测方法来识别血液中的微塑料粒子。

Method: 采用莖红染料染色和荧光显微镜技术，结合卷积神经网络进行图像分割和检测，开发了MicroDetect-Net(MDN)模型。

Result: 在276张荧光血液图像数据集上，MDN模型达到92%的准确率，IoU为87.4%，F1分数为92.1%，精度为90.6%，召回率为93.7%。

Conclusion: MDN模型通过深度学习与染色技术结合，能够高效准确地检测血液中的微塑料粒子，为人类微塑料检测提供了有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

TL;DR: ProPy模型通过创新的提示金字塔结构和祖先-后代交互机制，将CLIP模型成功应用于部分相关视频检索任务，在三个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分相关视频检索(PRVR)是一个实用但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：1)提示金字塔结构，组织事件提示以捕获多粒度语义；2)祖先-后代交互机制，实现事件间的动态语义交互。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了之前的模型。

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性的架构适配，成功将CLIP模型应用于PRVR任务，证明了多粒度事件语义建模的有效性。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

TL;DR: 通过自监督预训练技术，利用大规模血管几何模型数据集（8449个形状）来改善冠状动脉声声压分析的性能，解决医学图像数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学预测模型需要大规模数据训练，但医疗数据获取困难，特别是血液动力学标记物分析。需要找到方法充分利用可获得的血管几何模型数据来提升小规模临床数据的分析效果。

Method: 使用自监督预训练方法，通过计算热内核签名（heat kernel signature）作为自监督目标，该签名通过Laplacian特征向量捕捉血管形状的本质特征。在大规模数据集上预训练后，将学习到的表征转移到小规模临床数据集进行声声压分区分割。

Result: 实验结果显示，从大规模血管几何模型数据集学习到的几何表征可以显著提升冠状动脉声声压分区分割的性能，即使在有限的临床数据（49名患者）上训练也能获得良好效果。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练技术可以有效解决医学图像数据稀缺问题，通过大规模几何模型数据预训练的表征能够显著提升小规模临床数据的血液动力学标记物分析效果，为心血管健康预测提供了有效的数据利用方案。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一多样化监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决实际制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，但注释过程耗时耗力且需要专业知识，因此少样本学习成为了减少数据需求的有前景方向。

Method: 结合轻量级UNet++网络和一种初始用于神经元形态的连通性感知损失函数，该损失函数明确惩罚线条碎片化和意外合并等结构错误。仅使用每份手稿的3个注释页面进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著提升了当前最佳情况：识别准确性提高了200%，行交叉比提高了75%。在DIVA-HisDB基准检测任务中达到或超过竞赛胜者的F-Measure分数，仅需要3个注释页面。

Conclusion: 小型简单的网络结构结合拓扑感知损失函数能够在少样本情况下实现更高的准确性和数据效率，为历史文档分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目3D视觉定位方法虽然文本描述包含几何信息，但文本嵌入对数值大小敏感而忽略测量单位，导致预训练语言模型的3D理解能力不足，产生误导性文本特征。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) 3D文本增强(3DTE)：通过增强文本查询中距离描述符的多样性来改善不同单位间的映射关系理解；2) 文本引导几何增强(TGE)：将基础文本特征投影到几何一致空间，利用3D增强文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比之前的方法有显著改进，在"Far"场景中实现了11.94%的准确率提升，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 所提出的3D文本增强和文本引导几何增强方法有效提升了模型对文本嵌入和几何特征的3D感知能力，解决了文本嵌入对数值单位敏感的问题，显著提高了单目3D视觉定位的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WEF-PE位置编码方法，利用椭圆函数的双周期性和非线性几何特性，在复数域中直接处理二维坐标，解决了传统方法破坏图像空间结构的问题，在多个视觉任务上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置编码方法缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型有效利用空间邻近先验知识的能力。

Method: 基于Weierstrass椭圆函数的位置编码(WEF-PE)，利用椭圆函数的双周期特性与视觉数据中的平移不变性模式相匹配，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用代数加法公式从绝对编码直接推导任意补丁对之间的相对位置信息。

Result: 在多个实验中表现优异：ViT-Tiny在CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base在CIFAR-100微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进。理论分析证实了距离衰减特性，注意力可视化显示增强了几何归纳偏置和更一致的语义聚焦。

Conclusion: WEF-PE是一种数学原理严谨的方法，能够有效编码空间距离关系，提升Vision Transformer在视觉任务中的性能，同时提供更好的几何归纳偏置和语义一致性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

### [67] [FastMesh:Efficient Artistic Mesh Generation via Component Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19188)
*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过分离生成顶点和面片的方法，大幅减少网格生成的代序长度，实现8倍速度提升和更高的网格质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格生成方法将三角网格转换为代序序列时，因为顶点被多个面共享而导致代序重复和过长，影响生成效率

Method: 使用自回归模型生成顶点序列，然后用双向Transformer根据顶点关系构建邻接矩阵来完成面片生成，添加保真增强器精细顶点位置和后处理清除不良边缘

Result: 顶点代序长度降至现有方法的23%，网格生成速度提升8倍以上，同时产生更高质量的网格

Conclusion: 分离顶点和面片生成的框架能够有效减少网格表示的冗余性，在保持高质量的同时实现了显著的生成速度提升

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

### [68] [All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195)
*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个轻量级的All-in-One Slider模块，能够通过分解文本嵌入空间来实现多属性细粒度控制，避免了传统方法中每个属性需要独立训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型在逐步操控生成图像属性时遇到挑战，特别是对于人脸等细节丰富的内容。传统方法采用One-for-One方式，每个属性需要独立训练滑块，导致参数冗余和扩展性不足。

Method: 提出All-in-One Slider模块，将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏、具有语义意义的属性方向。该模块作为通用滑块，支持多属性细粒度控制，通过重组学习方向还能支持未见属性的零样本操控。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法能够实现准确且可扩展的属性操控，在性能上显著超过之前的方法。同时可以与逆向框架集成，对真实图像进行属性操控。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider为T2I模型提供了一种轻量、可解释且可扩展的属性操控方案，有效解决了传统方法的参数冗余和扩展性问题，拓宽了实际应用场景。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

*Jianwen Jiang,Weihong Zeng,Zerong Zheng,Jiaqi Yang,Chao Liang,Wang Liao,Han Liang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniHuman-1.5是一个视频角色动画生成框架，通过多模态大语言模型提供高级语义指导，结合专门的Multimodal DiT架构，生成物理合理且语义连贯的富有表现力的角色动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频角色模型只能产生物理相似的动作，但缺乏对情感、意图和上下文的深层语义理解，通常只与音频节奏等低级线索同步，无法捕捉角色的真实本质。

Method: 1. 利用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示，提供高级语义指导；2. 引入专门的Multimodal DiT架构，采用新颖的Pseudo Last Frame设计，有效融合多模态输入并缓解模态间冲突。

Result: 模型在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、运动自然度和与文本提示的语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先性能，并展现出对多人场景和非人类主体的出色扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态语义理解和专门架构设计，成功生成了既物理合理又语义连贯的富有表现力的角色动画，超越了简单的节奏同步，实现了上下文和情感共鸣的动作生成。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

### [70] [Automated Feature Tracking for Real-Time Kinematic Analysis and Shape Estimation of Carbon Nanotube Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19232)
*Kaveh Safavigerdini,Ramakrishna Surya,Jaired Collins,Prasad Calyam,Filiz Bunyak,Matthew R. Maschmann,Kannappan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了现有方法只能静态分析或缺乏连续轨迹分解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管动态生长的表征受到SEM成像中纳米级运动测量实验挑战的限制，现有方法只能提供静态分析或需要手动初始化，缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack集成了手工制作或深度特征检测器和匹配器，在粒子跟踪框架内实现碳纳米管微柱生长的运动学分析。通过13,540条手动标注轨迹的系统性评估，确定了ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器的最佳组合。

Result: VFTrack实现了F1分数0.78和α分数0.89的优异性能，能够将运动矢量分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，计算异质区域生长速率并重建演化的CNT柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUSM是一个基于状态空间模型的通用视频分割架构，通过序列掩码预测统一了提示和无提示视频分割，在多个基准测试中表现优异且训练速度提升2.5倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频分割模型在处理无提示分割（自动检测和跟踪所有对象）时存在碎片化问题，需要任务特定的模型和流水线，缺乏统一的解决方案

Method: 将流式视频分割重新定义为序列掩码预测，类似于语言建模。基于状态空间模型构建AUSM，维护固定大小的空间状态，支持任意长度视频流。所有组件都设计为跨帧并行训练

Result: 在多个标准基准测试（DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS）上优于先前的通用流式视频分割方法，在16帧序列上实现高达2.5倍的训练加速

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示和无提示视频分割，通过序列掩码预测方法和并行训练设计，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升，为视频分割提供了通用的端到端解决方案

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

*Beiqi Chen,Shuai Shao,Haitang Feng,Jianhuang Lai,Jianlou Si,Guangcong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Style4D-Bench，首个专门针对4D风格化的基准测试套件，包含评估协议、强基线方法和高质量4D场景数据集，并基于4D高斯溅射构建了Style4D框架实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，缺乏标准化的评估基准和数据集，阻碍了该领域的研究进展。需要建立统一的评估标准和强基线方法来推动发展。

Method: 基于4D高斯溅射构建Style4D框架，包含三个核心组件：基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（使用轻量级MLP进行时空感知外观控制）、整体几何保持风格迁移模块（通过对比一致性学习和结构内容保持增强时空一致性）。

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上的广泛实验表明，Style4D在4D风格化方面实现了最先进的性能，能够生成细粒度风格细节，具有稳定的时间动态和一致的多视角渲染效果。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究中宝贵的基准测试资源，有望推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法通过图像生成和网格对齐两个步骤实现，使用自注意力重连机制保持结构一致性，并通过关键点优化姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进展，但通过语言控制3D资产姿态的任务仍然具有挑战性。需要一种能够保持原始网格身份同时实现自由姿态控制的方法。

Method: 1) 修改图像生成器以根据输入图像和文本指令创建目标图像；2) 通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐；3) 引入自注意力重连机制(RSActrl)解耦源结构和姿态；4) 使用关键点而非可微分渲染建立输入和目标图像之间的对应关系。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现有效，成功操纵姿态同时保持网格原始身份。定量评估和用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，通过语言控制实现3D资产的姿态操作，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了优越的性能表现。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的3D局部编辑方法，通过在3D潜在空间中保留未编辑区域的反向潜在表示和键值令牌，实现精确且连贯的3D编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过编辑多视角图像后重建3D模型，但难以精确保持未编辑区域的完整性和整体连贯性。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反向轨迹获取反向潜在表示和键值令牌，然后在去噪编辑阶段用这些特征替换保留区域的去噪特征，确保未编辑区域的一致性重建。

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench数据集上的实验表明，VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了可能，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

TL;DR: 本文研究分配平台中如何通过鼓励代理人放宽限制来提升整体效用，同时保证不损害代理人利益，并在预算约束下优化限制放宽策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源分配平台中，通过鼓励代理人放宽某些限制可以提升整体社会福利，但需要确保不损害代理人原有利益，且受限于预算约束，需要系统性的优化方法。

Method: 提出了形式化的问题定义和参与保证层次结构，针对一对一和一对多分配设置开发了多项式时间算法，并在三个真实数据集上进行了广泛实验验证。

Result: 提供了有效的多项式算法解决优化问题，实验证明促进限制放宽能够显著提升社会福利，不同参与保证机制对结果有重要影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为分配平台提供了系统性的限制放宽优化框架，在保证代理人利益的前提下有效提升整体效用，具有重要的理论和实践价值。

Abstract: We consider a setting where goods are allocated to agents by way of an
allocation platform (e.g., a matching platform). An ``allocation facilitator''
aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by
encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the
same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off.
Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a.
`budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to
relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an
optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned
constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal
definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the
facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees
and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial
algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization
problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We
demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the
implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive
experimentation on three real-world datasets.

Method: 定义PCOG博弈模型，其中联盟价值由其拥有的图结构部分的最优解决定，分析四种经典图优化问题（顶点覆盖、支配集、生成树、匹配）的核心稳定性验证和存在性问题的计算复杂度

Result: 对四种图优化问题的核心稳定性问题进行了算法复杂度分析

Conclusion: PCOG博弈为研究基于组合优化问题的合作博弈提供了理论框架，核心稳定性问题的复杂度分析为实际应用提供了理论基础

Abstract: We propose a class of cooperative games, called d Partitioned Compbinatorial
Optimization Games (PCOGs). The input of PCOG consists of a set of agents and a
combinatorial structure (typically a graph) with a fixed optimization goal on
this structure (e.g., finding a minimum dominating set on a graph) such that
the structure is divided among the agents. The value of each coalition of
agents is derived from the optimal solution for the part of the structure
possessed by the coalition. We study two fundamental questions related to the
core: Core Stability Verification and Core Stability Existence. We analyze the
algorithmic complexity of both questions for four classic graph optimization
tasks: minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, minimum spanning tree, and
maximum matching.

TL;DR: 使用基于行为经济学个体数据的角色调整方法，改善LLM在最后通牒游戏中与人类决策行为的对齐度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在模拟人类决策时存在固有偏见，与真实人类行为存在差异，限制了其反映人口层面多样性的能力

Method: 采用基于角色的方法，利用行为经济学的个体层面行为数据来调整模型偏见，特别应用于最后通牒游戏这一标准基准

Result: 在响应者方面观察到模拟行为与实证行为之间的对齐度得到改善

Conclusion: 虽然需要进一步完善特质表征，但角色条件化LLM在大规模模拟类人决策模式方面展现出良好前景

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human
decision-making, but their intrinsic biases often diverge from real human
behavior--limiting their ability to reflect population-level diversity. We
address this challenge with a persona-based approach that leverages
individual-level behavioral data from behavioral economics to adjust model
biases. Applying this method to the ultimatum game--a standard but difficult
benchmark for LLMs--we observe improved alignment between simulated and
empirical behavior, particularly on the responder side. While further
refinement of trait representations is needed, our results demonstrate the
promise of persona-conditioned LLMs for simulating human-like decision patterns
at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个语言模型在不同领域各有优势与缺点，需要统合多模型优势来实现更稳健、准确的智能推理。

Method: 将每个LLM作为对等网络中的节点，通过嗅调协议交换答案和思考过程，渐进式地向共享解决方案进行协作。

Result: 嗅调共识机制导致了稳健、可靠且准确的多模型AI推理，充分发挥了各模型的集体优势。

Conclusion: 该方法类似于人类建立共识的方式，使AI更具协作性和可信质性，而非单纯的黑盒程序。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced rapidly, but no single model excels in
every area -- each has its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one
model alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems,
where information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement.
In this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared
solution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses
and thought processes to reach a collective decision. Our results show that
this "gossip-based consensus" leads to robust, resilient, and accurate
multi-agent AI reasoning. It helps overcome the weaknesses of individual models
and brings out their collective strengths. This approach is similar to how
humans build consensus, making AI seem more collaborative and trustworthy
instead of just a black-box program.

TL;DR: Murakkab是一个高效的代理工作流服务系统，通过声明式抽象解耦工作流规范与执行配置，实现跨层优化，显著降低GPU使用、能耗和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理工作流服务效率低下，工作流组件分散在不同实体中，无法在准确性、延迟、能耗和成本之间进行权衡优化，导致资源浪费和服务质量下降。

Method: 引入声明式抽象解耦工作流规范与执行配置，采用配置文件引导的优化器和自适应运行时共同管理全栈，包括协调工作流组件、映射到模型和硬件，以及动态重新配置执行以满足用户定义的SLO。

Result: 在多样化工作流上的评估显示，Murakkab将GPU使用降低2.8倍，能耗降低3.7倍，成本降低4.3倍，同时保持SLO。

Conclusion: 通过暴露代理工作流的内部结构，Murakkab实现了现有框架和云调度器无法达到的跨层优化，显著提升了资源效率和服务质量。

Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex
control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI
applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's
frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences
of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware
choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different
entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy,
latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded
service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic
workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples
workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer
and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow
components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring
execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of
agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing
frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \sysname{} reduces GPU usage
by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by
4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多智能体神经符号框架，结合强化学习导师和LLM驱动的同伴智能体，通过中央教育本体统一，旨在解决学生自主学习中的目标设定、进度跟踪和策略调整问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育面临的核心挑战是如何让学生拥有学习自主权，包括设定有意义的目標、追踪进度和在遇到挫折时调整策略。AI驱动的数字学习环境为此提供了新的可能性，特别是大型语言模型和神经符号系统的发展为重新构想学习支持方式带来了变革机会。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体神经符号框架，包含两个专门化智能体：基于强化学习的'导师'智能体提供权威的非语言支架支持，而主动的LLM驱动的'同伴'智能体促进学习的社会维度。框架的创新之处在于通过中央教育本体将这些智能体统一起来。

Conclusion: 该研究为推进AI驱动的学习环境提供了重要见解和未来方向，展示了多智能体神经符号框架在培养学生自主学习能力方面的潜力，特别是在结合不同AI技术优势方面的创新价值。

Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to
take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their
progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has
shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through
structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded
inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have
increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning
environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,
meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is
delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially
interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support
that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In
parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents
that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these
remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed
to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct
pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides
authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'
agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has
explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying
them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both
college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's
adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future
directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.

TL;DR: 提出了FairSkillMARL框架，将公平性定义为工作量平衡和技能任务对齐的双重目标，并开发了MARLHospital医疗环境来研究异构多智能体系统中的公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL中的公平性研究往往只关注工作量平衡，忽视了智能体专业技能的差异和现实领域（如医疗）中需要的结构化协调，这可能导致技能任务不匹配和资源浪费。

Method: 提出FairSkillMARL框架，结合工作量平衡和技能任务对齐的双重公平目标；开发MARLHospital可定制医疗环境模拟团队组成和能量约束调度；与四种标准MARL方法和两种最先进公平指标进行比较实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅基于工作量相等的公平性可能导致任务技能不匹配，需要更鲁棒的指标来捕捉技能任务不对齐问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为研究异构多智能体系统中公平性提供了工具和基础，强调了在关键领域中使努力与专业知识对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a
workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured
coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task
allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout
and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing
an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare
workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address
this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines
fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.
Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired
environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling
impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this
problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with
four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.
Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to
task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that
capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for
studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort
with expertise is critical.

Motivation: 在CAV与人类驾驶车辆共存的混合自动驾驶环境中，由于驾驶行为的异质性，实现CAV之间的高效协调具有挑战性。需要一种既能提高交通效率又能降低计算开销的协调方法。

Method: 建立了考虑CAV存在与否的交通密度演化方程，构建分布式协调控制框架。采用邻居智能体运动学信息和逐智能体顺序求解机制实现显式合作，并引入基于控制序列评估的自适应截断滚动方案来缩短优化时域。

Result: 在真实世界瓶颈场景的大规模混合交通流仿真中，该方法相比传统模型预测控制方法，显著降低了瓶颈区域平均行程时间和总体计算时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过理论分析保证了系统稳定性和性能提升，在减少计算复杂度的同时提高了交通效率，展现出强大的实际部署潜力。

Abstract: The development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers
substantial opportunities to enhance traffic efficiency. However, in mixed
autonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs),
achieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to
heterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a
multiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to
improve highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this
approach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that
comprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed
coordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating
kinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent
sequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among
CAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively
shortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences.
This significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time
performance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees
on the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations
conducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale
mixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model
predictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the
bottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong
potential for practical deployment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作式框架，通过分享深度学习的中心独立表征来分割缷血性脑梗死病变，解决了单一机构数据不足和模型普遍化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑梗死是全球第二大死因和第三大游病因，但病变分析存在巨大变异性。现有计算方法仅从单一机构学习，缺乏变异性和普遍化能力，而且许多临床中心缺乏足够的标签数据。

Method: 开发了一种协作框架，通过分享深度学习的中心独立表征来分割缷血性脑梗死病变。基于14个模拟健康中心的2031个研究数据，采用FedAvg模型。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心获得了DSC 0.71±0.24、AVD 5.29±22.74、ALD 2.16±3.60和LF1 0.70±0.26的结果，超过了集中式和其他联邦学习规则。模型显示出强大的普遍化能力，在分布外中心也获得了DSC 0.64±0.29和AVD 4.44±8.74的可靠性能。

Conclusion: 该协作框架通过联邦学习技术有效解决了缷血性脑梗死病变分割的数据封闭和普遍化问题，为多中心协作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Conclusion: 两阶段方法在欠采样MRI数据分割中表现更优，为未来研究提供了重要基准和指导

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的sRGB域扩散模型处理有损的sRGB输入，忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景（如边缘设备图像采集）中的可访问性，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，构建可扩展的退化管道从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW低质量-高质量对，并设计可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，能以更少的伪影产生更高保真度的结果。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域进行图像恢复，成功规避了传统两阶段ISP+IR管道的限制，为图像恢复任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Conclusion: 该方法推进了基于认知基础、可解释的理性训练课程的发展

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

Conclusion: 为网络威胁智能和网络防御领域的主动学习流水线提供了可操作的相似函数选择指南

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

Motivation: 现有抑郁检测系统需要长时间数据采集，无法满足早期检测的急需

Method: 开发快速工具采集100名学生的7天程序使用数据，使用多种机器学习模型和特征选择方法

Result: light gradient boosting模型达到82.4%抑郁检出率（精度=75%，F1分数=78.5%），堆叠模型最高精度77.4%

Conclusion: 该快速最小化系统可为发展中地区的抑郁检测做出贡献，推动开发资源消耗更少的系统

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

Result: 在攻击效率和鲁棒训练方面取得显著提升

Conclusion: 该框架作为实用的模型无关工具，可提升基于Transformer的NLP系统的可靠性

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Conclusion: CoPE通过复数编码有效整合内容和位置信息，提供了一种高效且性能优越的位置编码解决方案，在保持高性能的同时降低了计算成本

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

Conclusion: 提高被选回复质量是构建高效偏好数据集的关键，该研究为LLM对齐实践提供了重要给导

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

Conclusion: ProtoEHR框架能够充分利用EHR数据的多层次结构，在提高预测性能的同时提供代码、就诊和患者层面的可解释性洞察，有助于医疗预测决策。

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant

at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict

The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

Motivation: HSIC方法在处理大规模数据时计算复杂度过高（O(n^2.37)），需要更高效的统计依赖评估方法

Method: 提出HCR（分层相关重建）方法，使用混合矩特征描述数据依赖关系，单个特征计算仅需O(n)线性时间

Result: HCR不仅计算效率更高，在测试中表现出更高的依赖敏感性，还能提供实际的联合分布模型和近似互信息

Conclusion: HCR是HSIC的高效替代方案，线性复杂度使其适用于大规模数据，同时提供更丰富的依赖关系描述能力

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效的训练后MoE优化方法，通过利用双重稀疏性在几乎保持原有准确性的前提下实现了显著的计算效率提升，为大规模MoE模型的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

*André Quadros,Cassio Silva,Ronnie Alves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 结合VAE状态新颖性奖励和LLM知识驱动的内在奖励策略，显著提升了稀疏奖励环境下强化学习代理的性能和采样效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端稀疏奖励环境中传统强化学习因反馈稀少而难以有效学习的问题

Method: 集成VSIMR（变分自编码器状态新颖性奖励）和LLM驱动的内在奖励，在MiniGrid DoorKey环境中使用A2C算法实现

Result: 组合策略相比单一策略或标准A2C显著提高了代理性能和采样效率，标准A2C完全无法学习

Conclusion: VSIMR驱动状态探索，LLM奖励促进目标导向利用，两种策略互补有效解决了稀疏奖励问题

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维贝叶斯优化面临挑战，现有TuRBO方法使用局部高斯过程虽然能避免过度探索，但采样效率较低。需要一种既能保持异质建模又能提高采样效率的方法。

Method: 利用全局高斯过程的梯度和Hessian矩阵构建多个局部二次模型，通过求解边界约束二次规划来选择新样本点，同时解决了高维空间中梯度消失问题。

Result: 通过收敛性分析和实验验证，该方法显著提升了TuRBO的效果，在合成函数和实际应用中优于多种高维贝叶斯优化技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法成功结合了全局建模的效率和局部建模的精度，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件描述语言（如Verilog）由于其并发语义、语法刚性和仿真复杂性，在代码生成领域研究不足，需要专门的方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 构建Veribench-53K高质量数据集，提出Trace-back重评分机制利用推理路径和迭代优化增强反馈可靠性，采用样本平衡权重策略平衡学习动态，建立迭代式RL管道共同演化策略和奖励模型。

Result: 在Verilog生成任务上实现了最先进的性能，在测试通过率、功能正确性和编译鲁棒性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在硬件中心领域的结构化代码生成中具有巨大潜力，使用较小但高质量的数据集结合RL优化可以超越依赖大规模闭源模型蒸馏的方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

Result: 在Yahoo A1和A2基准数据集上优于最先进的无监督和半监督方法，保持高精度和召回率

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界异常检测任务提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Motivation: 虽然已有研究指出记忆化与增强之间存在联系，但系统性数据增强设计在机器遗忘中的作用仍未得到充分研究。本研究旨在探索不同数据增强策略对遗忘方法性能的影响。

Method: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用不同遗忘率，测试了SalUn、随机标签和微调等遗忘方法，并评估了多种数据增强策略的效果。

Result: 实验表明，适当的数据增强设计能显著提高遗忘效果，使用TrivialAug增强方法时，平均差距遗忘指标最多可降低40.12%，有效缩小了与重新训练模型的性能差距。

Conclusion: 数据增强不仅有助于减少记忆化，还在实现隐私保护和高效遗忘方面发挥着关键作用，系统性的增强设计对机器遗忘性能有重要影响。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model while preserving its performance on the remaining data. Although
a few works suggest connections between memorisation and augmentation, the role
of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this
work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on
the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and
Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying
forget rates, show that proper augmentation design can significantly improve
unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models.
Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning
Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that
augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role
in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分量子算法(VQAs)在近期量子设备应用中前景广阔，但受到贫瘠高原问题的严重制约，即梯度随系统规模或电路深度增加而指数衰减，阻碍了算法训练

Method: 探索多种RL算法（确定性策略梯度、软演员-评论家、近端策略优化等）来生成最小化VQA成本函数的电路参数，在标准梯度优化前进行RL预训练

Result: 在各种噪声条件和任务下的广泛数值实验表明，RL初始化方法显著提高了收敛速度和最终解质量，多种RL算法都能获得相当的性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法为机器学习技术与量子算法设计的整合开辟了有前景的途径，RL驱动的参数初始化可以加速VQAs的可扩展性和实际部署

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

Motivation: 现有方法如部分信息分解难以扩展到两个以上模态，且缺乏实例级控制能力。当额外模态引入噪声而非互补信息时，MoE模型的有效性不明确

Method: BTW双层级非参数加权框架：实例级使用KL散度衡量单模态与多模态预测的差异，模态级使用互信息估计全局对齐，动态调整训练时的模态重要性

Result: 在情感回归和多类分类任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提高了回归性能和多类分类准确率

Conclusion: BTW框架有效解决了多模态学习中噪声模态的问题，通过动态权重调整提升了模型性能，且具有良好的可扩展性

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了可解释性和分子设计之间的差距，为化学中的可解释机器学习提供了一条原则性和生成性的路径。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法在复杂系统中长期预测精度下降，自回归训练需要大量GPU内存且可能牺牲短期性能

Method: SPF框架构建模型预测的补充数据集，通过随机采集策略与真实数据结合，在epoch间预计算多步预测，保持内存使用稳定

Result: 在Burgers方程和浅水基准测试中，SPF比自回归方法获得更高的长期精度，同时降低内存需求

Conclusion: SPF框架为资源受限和复杂模拟提供了有前景的解决方案，平衡了短期和长期性能

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

Result: SAEs在适应性预测中始终优于或与ESM2基线竞争，其稀疏潜在空间编码了紧凑且具有生物学意义的表示，能从有限数据中更有效地泛化

Conclusion: SAEs为低数据量蛋白质功能预测和设计提供了有效解决方案，通过利用pLM表示中的生物基序，显著提高了蛋白质工程的成功率

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL系统存在GPU利用率低的问题，主要原因是rollout阶段占主导地位和rollout长度不平衡导致的GPU气泡。传统异步执行和截断方法会牺牲训练准确性。

Conclusion: RhymeRL通过利用历史rollout的相似性，在不改变RL范式和不损失准确性的前提下，显著提升了RL训练效率。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了主投资组合方法的局限性，在理论和实验层面都取得了显著成果，为信号交易提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based
trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore
the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

Motivation: 解决时间序列数据中训练和测试集间常见的分布偏移问题，提高模型在未标注测试数据上的演绎能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多尺度特征提取和不确定性估计的结合，有效地解决了时间序列数据的无监督域适配问题，具有良好的演绎性和稳健性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRATA-TS是一个针对时间序列数据稀缺问题的选择性迁移学习框架，通过目标感知检索和大型语言模型推理，提升城市预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市预测模型面临严重的数据不平衡问题：少数城市有密集的长期记录，而许多其他城市只有短期或不完整的历史数据。直接迁移会导致噪声和负迁移风险

Method: 使用基于片段的时间编码器识别与目标查询语义和动态对齐的源子序列，然后将检索到的样本注入检索引导的推理阶段，由LLM对目标输入和检索支持进行结构化推理

Result: 在新加坡、诺丁汉和格拉斯哥三个停车可用性数据集上的广泛实验表明，STRATA-TS始终优于强大的预测和迁移基线

Conclusion: 该框架通过可解释的知识迁移路径，有效解决了数据稀缺环境下的城市预测问题，并通过监督微调实现了高效部署

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

TL;DR: BDVAE是一种新型深度生成模型，通过整合多组学数据和生物学通路信息，准确预测免疫检查点抑制剂治疗反应并揭示耐药机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有免疫检查点抑制剂预测模型缺乏可解释性，且未能有效利用多组学数据的生物学结构信息，需要开发既能准确预测又能提供生物学洞见的模型。

Method: 开发了生物解缠变分自编码器(BDVAE)，使用模态和通路特异性编码器整合转录组和基因组数据，通过变分推理学习与免疫、基因组和代谢过程相关的生物学意义潜在特征。

Result: 在366名患者的泛癌队列中，BDVAE实现了0.94的AUC-ROC预测准确率，揭示了免疫抑制、代谢转变和神经元信号等关键耐药机制，发现耐药性呈现连续生物学谱系而非严格二元状态。

Conclusion: BDVAE证明了生物学结构机器学习在阐明复杂耐药模式和指导精准免疫治疗策略方面的价值，能够生成可解释且临床相关的生物学洞见。

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FFT MoE是一个新的联邦微调框架，用稀疏专家混合（MoE）适配器替代LoRA，解决了异构联邦学习环境中结构不兼容和适应非IID数据的问题，通过轻量级门控网络和异质性感知辅助损失实现更好的泛化性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型向AGI发展，在隐私和资源约束下进行微调变得至关重要。联邦学习通过联邦微调（FFT）提供了解决方案，但现有的LoRA-based FFT在异构FL环境中存在结构不兼容和非IID数据适应性问题。

Method: 提出FFT MoE框架，用稀疏MoE适配器替代LoRA。每个客户端训练轻量级门控网络选择性地激活个性化专家子集，并引入异质性感知辅助损失来动态正则化路由分布，确保专家多样性和平衡利用。

Result: 在IID和非IID条件下的广泛实验表明，FFT MoE在泛化性能和训练效率方面始终优于最先进的FFT基线方法。

Conclusion: FFT MoE通过MoE适配器和异质性感知路由机制，有效解决了异构联邦学习环境中的关键挑战，为隐私保护下的高效模型微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法假设保留数据不受影响，但隐私洋葱效应表明这个假设可能不正确，特别是在差分隐私模型下，需要全面审计遗忘和保留样本的隐私风险。

Result: 实验发现现有近似机器遗忘算法可能无意中损害差分隐私模型中保留样本的隐私。

Conclusion: 需要开发差分隐私遗忘算法来确保保留样本的隐私保护，提出的审计方法为评估遗忘效果提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现MoE模型的稀疏性对记忆能力和推理能力有不同影响：记忆性能随总参数增加而提升，但推理性能会饱和甚至下降，即使训练损失继续改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有经验缩放定律主要针对密集模型，而MoE模型引入了新的稀疏维度，需要研究稀疏性如何影响不同能力机制（记忆vs推理）。

Method: 训练多个MoE Transformer模型家族，系统性地改变总参数、激活参数和top-k路由，同时保持计算预算固定，记录预训练损失、下游任务损失和准确率。

Result: 记忆基准测试随总参数单调改善，而推理性能会饱和甚至下降；改变top-k路由在激活参数恒定时影响很小；强化学习和额外测试计算无法挽救过度稀疏模型的推理缺陷。

Conclusion: MoE稀疏性对记忆和推理能力有不同影响，推理性能存在饱和点，过度稀疏会损害推理能力，这为MoE模型设计提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

TL;DR: LRTab是一种新颖的提示学习方法，通过从训练数据中检索相关提示条件来增强表格推理，结合了微调的数据特定学习和零样本提示的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表格推理方法要么通过微调获得数据集特定性能但缺乏泛化性，要么通过零样本提示具有良好泛化性但无法充分利用训练数据。需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 首先使用提示获取训练数据的思维链响应，对错误的思维链预测提示条件以避免错误，然后在推理时检索最相关的提示条件作为额外上下文。

Result: 在WikiTQ和Tabfact数据集上的实验表明，LRTab具有可解释性、成本效益高，并且在表格推理任务上优于之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: LRTab成功地将训练数据的学习与提示检索相结合，为表格理解提供了一种有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法（如朴素贝叶斯、SVM、随机森林、XGBoost）依赖手动特征工程，难以处理电子健康记录中不规则、不完整的时间序列数据，需要开发更有效的脓毒症早期检测方法。

Method: 端到端深度学习框架：使用无监督自编码器进行自动特征提取，结合多层感知器分类器进行二元脓毒症风险预测；采用定制下采样策略提取高信息密度片段，以及非重叠动态滑动窗口机制进行实时推理；预处理时间序列数据为固定维度向量并包含显式缺失指示器。

Result: 在三个ICU队列中分别取得74.6%、80.6%和93.5%的准确率，始终优于传统机器学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在异质ICU环境中展现出优异的鲁棒性、泛化能力和临床实用性，为脓毒症早期检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个统一的物理-信息理论框架，将高维特征嵌入到低维空间中，同时保持分类性能，解决传统方法在压缩和性能之间的权衡问题。

Method: 使用冻结的MobileNetV2提取特征，将其建模为稀疏MET-QC-LDPC图上的随机键Ising模型。在Nishimori温度下操作，利用拓扑不变量指导图设计，采用二次插值和牛顿校正高效估计关键参数。

Result: 在ImageNet-10上达到98.7%准确率，ImageNet-100上达到82.7%准确率，实现40倍参数压缩，计算速度比二分法快6倍。

Conclusion: 拓扑引导的图设计能够产生高效、物理启发的嵌入，在极大压缩下仍能实现最先进的性能，证明了物理-信息理论框架在多类分类中的有效性。

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的方法忽略了RTL代码的结构语义，而CDFG视图能更明确地展示设计结构特征，为表示学习提供更丰富的线索。

Method: 提出结构感知的图自监督学习框架StructRTL，从CDFG学习结构感知表示，并采用知识蒸馏策略将后映射网表的低级洞察转移到CDFG预测器中。

Result: 该方法在各种质量估计任务上显著优于现有技术，建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 结合结构学习和跨阶段监督的方法在RTL设计质量估计中非常有效。

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

TL;DR: FLAegis是一个两阶段防御框架，使用符号时间序列转换和谱聚类检测拜占庭客户端，并通过FFT聚合提高联邦学习系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性限制了训练过程的可见性，依赖于参与客户端的诚实性，这使得恶意第三方（拜占庭客户端）可能通过提交虚假模型更新来毒化训练过程。

Method: 采用两阶段防御框架：1）使用符号时间序列转换（SAX）放大良性模型和恶意模型之间的差异；2）使用谱聚类准确检测对抗行为；3）集成基于FFT的鲁棒聚合函数作为最终层来减轻逃过先前防御的拜占庭客户端的影响。

Result: 在五种投毒攻击（从简单标签翻转到自适应优化策略）上的严格评估表明，该方法在检测精度和最终模型准确性方面均优于最先进的防御方法，即使在强对抗条件下也能保持持续高性能。

Conclusion: FLAegis框架有效提高了联邦学习系统对拜占庭攻击的鲁棒性，通过创新的检测和聚合机制实现了优异的防御性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

TL;DR: 本文分析了离线强化学习和离线逆强化学习中Bellman残差最小化(BRM)方法的统计性能，提出了新的稳定性边界和超额风险边界，在标准神经网络参数化和小批量SGD下实现了O(1/n)的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线强化学习和离线逆强化学习实践中难以有效实施Bellman一致性，虽然已有基于随机梯度下降-上升的全局收敛BRM方法，但其在离线设置下的统计行为尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入单个Lyapunov势函数来耦合相邻数据集上的SGDA运行，获得O(1/n)的平均参数稳定性边界，并将该稳定性常数转化为BRM的O(1/n)超额风险边界。

Result: 实现了比凸-凹鞍点问题已知最佳样本复杂度指数高一倍的性能，无需方差缩减、额外正则化或对小批量采样的限制性独立假设。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了BRM方法在离线设置下的统计空白，为离线强化学习和逆强化学习提供了理论保证，在标准神经网络和小批量SGD设置下具有实用价值。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

Motivation: 现有模型降维方法主要基于变量缩减，而约束缩减这一对偶视角被忽视。约束缩减通过将不等式约束转为等式也能降低MILP复杂度，但面临关键约束识别和高效预测两大挑战

Method: 首先标记最优解处的紧约束作为潜在关键约束，设计启发式规则选择关键子集；提出多模态表示技术，同时利用实例级和抽象级MILP公式信息来学习关键紧约束

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进方法，本方法提升解质量超过50%，减少计算时间17.47%

Conclusion: 约束基模型降维是有效的MILP加速方法，多模态表示技术能成功识别关键约束，在解质量和计算效率方面均显著优于现有变量缩减方法

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraMemV2是一种改进的内存层架构，通过五项关键改进实现了与8专家MoE模型相当的性能，同时显著降低了内存访问成本，在内存密集型任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家(MoE)模型虽然通过激活参数子集实现高效计算，但在推理时存在高内存访问成本的问题。之前的内存层架构如UltraMem只能匹配2专家MoE的性能，无法达到8专家MoE的先进水平。

Method: 提出了五项关键改进：1)在每个transformer块中集成内存层；2)使用单线性投影简化值扩展；3)采用基于FFN的值处理；4)实施原则性参数初始化；5)重新平衡内存到FFN的计算比例。

Result: UltraMemV2在相同计算和参数条件下实现了与8专家MoE模型的性能相当，但内存访问显著降低。在内存密集型任务上表现优异：长上下文记忆+1.6分，多轮记忆+6.2分，上下文学习+7.9分。验证了激活密度比总稀疏参数数量对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: UltraMemV2使内存层架构达到了与最先进MoE模型相当的性能水平，为高效稀疏计算提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS)框架，作为分布式AI系统的运行时治理层，通过声明式规则和信任评分机制来强制执行政策，而不需要修改模型内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统向分布式生态系统发展，现有的监督机制反应性差、脆弱且嵌入在代理架构中，缺乏可扩展、解耦的治理方案，存在结构性风险。

Method: GaaS采用模块化、政策驱动的执行层，使用声明式规则和信任因子机制对代理进行评分，支持强制、规范和自适应干预，实现分级执行和动态信任调节。

Result: 在三个模拟场景中使用开源模型测试，GaaS能可靠地阻止或重定向高风险行为，同时保持吞吐量，信任分数能有效跟踪规则遵守情况并隔离不可信组件。

Conclusion: GaaS将治理定位为类似计算或存储的运行时服务，为可互操作的代理生态系统建立了基础设施级别的对齐机制，不是教导代理道德，而是强制执行道德规范。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

TL;DR: 本文研究联邦学习中客户端标签集异构性问题，比较了公共标签设置和私有标签设置对模型性能的影响，提出了适应私有标签集的标准联邦学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中客户端标签集异构性很常见但研究较少，特别是当客户端只与中央服务器共享私有标签集时，这给学习算法带来了更多约束，是一个更难解决的问题。

Method: 应用分类器组合问题的经典方法进行集中调优，将常见联邦学习方法适配到私有标签集设置，并在实际假设下讨论两种方法的合理性。

Result: 实验显示减少每个客户端可用标签数量会显著损害所有方法的性能。集中调优客户端模型进行表示对齐可以改善性能，但通常以更高方差为代价。提出的标准联邦学习方法适配在私有标签设置中表现良好，与标准方法在公共设置中的性能相似。

Conclusion: 客户端可以在几乎不损失模型准确性的情况下享受更高的隐私保护，提出的适配方法在私有标签设置中有效。

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

TL;DR: SWiFT是一种高效的机器学习模型去偏框架，通过软掩码权重微调技术，仅需少量外部数据和少量训练轮次即可显著提升模型公平性，同时保持诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法需要原始训练数据和大量重新训练，且在公平性和性能之间存在权衡。医疗等敏感领域需要更高效、低成本的去偏解决方案。

Method: 首先识别模型参数对偏差和预测性能的相对贡献，然后通过两步微调过程，根据参数贡献度使用不同的梯度流更新每个参数。

Result: 在4个皮肤病学和2个胸部X光数据集上，针对性别、肤色和年龄等敏感属性，SWiFT能持续减少模型偏差，在公平性和准确性指标上达到或超越最先进方法，并在多个分布外数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SWiFT提供了一种高效、低成本的模型去偏解决方案，在保持诊断准确性的同时显著提升模型公平性和泛化能力，适用于医疗等敏感领域。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

TL;DR: 使用深度强化学习策略合作决策过程，同时优化样本分类和高风险样本拒绝手动标注，提升Android恶意软件检测在概念漏涉环境下的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际恶意软件检测面临概念漏涉、标签预算有限和预测不确定性挑战，传统分类器无法合理决策何时延迟决策或调整适应，需要新方法提升在动态环境下的检测稳定性。

Method: 将恶意软件检测形式化为一步马尔可夫决策过程，训练深度强化学习(DRL)代理，同时优化样本分类性能和将高风险样本拒绝交由手动标注。通过时间敏感评估在Android恶意数据集上验证多年稳定性能力。

Result: DRL基于的恶意软件检测(DRMD)代理在不同设置下均实现了更高的时间积分(AUT)性能：纯分类提升5.18%±5.44%，分类加拒绝提升14.49%±12.86%，分类加拒绝和主动学习提升10.06%±10.81%，显示出更好的概念漏涉弹性。

Conclusion: 这是首次证明深度强化学习可以在Android恶意软件动态环境中实现有效的检测和提升对概念漏涉的弹性，为实际恶意软件检测系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

Motivation: 传统上下文决斗赌博机模型只捕获用户在内容平台导航时的隐式选择，但无法利用用户在消费物品后提供的更可靠比较反馈

Method: 算法每次推荐一个物品，用户消费后将其与历史消费物品进行比较；通过初始随机探索阶段积累丰富历史，利用矩阵集中界证明理论保证

Result: 理论分析显示算法能达到O(√T)的遗憾上界，模拟实验表明重用历史物品进行比较比仅比较同时推荐物品能显著降低遗憾

Conclusion: 提出的新模型通过有效利用用户历史消费物品进行比较查询，在不产生额外遗憾的情况下获得了更好的性能表现

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

Conclusion: MOCHA框架成功解决了时间点过程中多阶动态因果关系的发现问题，为建模复杂事件序列提供了有效的解决方案，同时保持了良好的解释性。

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和GRPO在长时域任务中探索能力有限，需要一种能够更好利用完整轨迹历史并平衡探索与稳定性的框架。

Method: 将轨迹压缩为累积对数似然，使用Plackett-Luce softmax获得与回报成正比的归一化权重，添加熵正则化和软KL惩罚来稳定训练。

Result: HAEPO收敛快、探索充分、与真实奖励对齐良好，在多样化任务中表现优于或与PPO、GRPO、DPO相当。

Conclusion: HAEPO提供了一个稳定且可解释的框架，通过显式利用完整轨迹历史来平衡探索和稳定性。

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient,
and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in
modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse
data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that
explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a
cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data
engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,
protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic
normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.
pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of
sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss
functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include
batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize
computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning
models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a
modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license
at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time

Motivation: 标准神经过程依赖全局潜在变量，在不确定性校准和捕捉局部数据依赖方面存在困难

Result: DNP在回归和分类任务中实现了强大的预测性能和改进的不确定性校准

Conclusion: DNP通过结合全局和局部潜在结构有效解决了标准神经过程的不确定性估计问题

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

Method: 在动态函数关于状态变量Lipschitz连续的条件下，证明神经ODE的解具有有界变差，基于此建立时间依赖和时间独立两种情况的泛化界。

Result: 证明了在Lipschitz条件下神经ODE解的有界变差性质，并成功推导出适用于一般非线性动态的泛化误差边界。

Conclusion: 这是首次为具有一般非线性动态的神经ODE推导泛化界，为理解这类连续深度架构模型的泛化性能提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

*Yao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HierCVAE是一个结合层次注意力机制和条件变分自编码器的新架构，用于复杂系统的时间建模，在预测精度和不确定性校准方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统中的时间建模需要捕获多个时间尺度的依赖关系并管理固有不确定性，现有方法在这方面存在不足。

Method: 使用三层注意力结构（局部、全局、跨时间）结合多模态条件编码，在潜在空间中采用ResFormer块，并通过预测头提供明确的不确定性量化。

Result: 在能源消耗数据集上评估显示，预测精度提升15-40%，不确定性校准优于最先进方法，在长期预测和复杂多变量依赖方面表现优异。

Conclusion: HierCVAE通过层次注意力机制和条件变分自编码器的结合，有效解决了复杂时间序列建模中的多尺度依赖和不确定性管理问题。

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across
multiple time scales while managing inherent uncertainties. We propose
HierCVAE, a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention
mechanisms with conditional variational autoencoders to address these
challenges. HierCVAE employs a three-tier attention structure (local, global,
cross-temporal) combined with multi-modal condition encoding to capture
temporal, statistical, and trend information. The approach incorporates
ResFormer blocks in the latent space and provides explicit uncertainty
quantification via prediction heads. Through evaluations on energy consumption
datasets, HierCVAE demonstrates a 15-40% improvement in prediction accuracy and
superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods,
excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于能量视角的流匹配方法，用于分子结构生成，在蛋白质对接和骨架生成任务中优于现有流匹配和扩散模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子结构生成在分子对接、蛋白质折叠和分子设计等生物应用中至关重要。现有生成模型如扩散模型和流匹配已取得进展，但需要从能量角度改进训练和推理。

Method: 采用基于能量的视角，通过深度网络学习映射函数，迭代地将随机配置映射到目标结构，构建概念简单且经验有效的流匹配设置。

Result: 在蛋白质对接和蛋白质骨架生成实验中，该方法在相同计算预算下优于最近的流匹配和扩散模型基线。

Conclusion: 基于能量视角的流匹配方法在分子结构生成任务中表现出色，具有理论依据和实际应用价值，与AlphaFold中的结构精炼等技术有有趣联系。

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

*Laurence A. F. Park,Jesse Read*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 多标签数据分析中，使用多元Probit、多元Bernoulli和分段Logit三种模型来估计标签间的条件协方差，发现多元Probit模型错误率最低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签数据分析需要先评估标签间的依赖性，但标签独立性不能直接从标签值测量，而需通过条件协方差来评估

Method: 比较三种模型（多元Probit、多元Bernoulli和分段Logit）在估计常数协方差和依赖协方差方面的性能，通过实验观察各模型对条件协方差的测量

Result: 所有模型都能根据协方差强度同样好地测量常数和依赖协方差，但都会在存在常数协方差时误检测到依赖协方差，多元Probit模型的错误率最低

Conclusion: 多标签数据分析中，多元Probit模型是估计标签间条件协方差的最优选择，虽然所有模型都存在误检依赖性的问题

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

TL;DR: 本文研究Koopman表示在混沌动力系统中的泛化能力，重点关注其在预测和控制任务间的可迁移性。使用Lorenz系统作为测试平台，提出三阶段方法：通过自编码学习Koopman嵌入、在下一状态预测上预训练transformer、为安全关键控制进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Koopman表示在复杂动力系统中的通用性和可迁移性，为物理信息机器学习中的多任务学习提供基础表示方法。

Method: 三阶段方法：1）通过自编码学习Koopman嵌入表示；2）在下一状态预测任务上预训练transformer模型；3）针对安全关键控制任务进行微调。使用Lorenz混沌系统作为测试平台。

Result: Koopman嵌入表示在准确性和数据效率方面均优于标准和物理信息PCA基线方法。在微调过程中固定预训练transformer权重不会导致性能下降，表明学习到的表示捕获了可重用的动力结构而非任务特定模式。

Conclusion: Koopman嵌入表示能够有效捕获动力系统的可重用结构，为物理信息机器学习中的多任务学习提供了有前景的基础表示方法，支持跨预测和控制任务的表示迁移。

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across
prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose
a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,
pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAX-TS是一种模型无关的事后解释算法，用于解释时间序列预测模型及其预测结果，通过局部输入扰动生成多粒度解释，并能表征多元时间序列的跨通道相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代预测模型通常不透明且不提供预测解释，而现有的事后可解释性方法（如LIME）不适用于预测场景，因此需要专门的时间序列预测解释方法。

Method: 基于局部输入扰动的模型无关事后解释算法，通过扰动输入时间序列来生成多粒度解释，能够处理多元时间序列的跨通道相关性。

Result: 在7种算法和10个不同数据集上的基准测试表明，PAX-TS能有效捕捉模型行为，高绩效和低绩效算法的解释存在差异，并识别出6类跨数据集和算法重复出现的模式。

Conclusion: PAX-TS能够以不同详细程度说明时间序列预测模型的机制，其解释可用于回答关于预测的实际问题，且识别出的模式可作为性能指标。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

TL;DR: FedProtoKD是一种改进的异构联邦学习方法，通过双知识蒸馏机制和对比学习来解决原型聚合中的边缘收缩问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的原型异构联邦学习方法在服务器端使用加权平均聚合原型，导致全局知识次优和原型边缘收缩问题，特别是在模型异构和数据极度非独立同分布的场景下影响性能。

Method: 提出FedProtoKD方法，采用增强的双知识蒸馏机制（客户端logits和原型特征表示），使用基于对比学习的可训练服务器原型和类自适应原型边缘来解决原型边缘收缩问题，并通过样本原型与类代表原型的接近度评估公共样本重要性。

Result: 在各种设置下实现了1.13%到34.13%的平均准确率提升，显著优于现有的最先进异构联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: FedProtoKD通过创新的双知识蒸馏和对比学习机制有效解决了原型聚合中的边缘收缩问题，为异构联邦学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

*Gary Simethy,Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo,Petar Durdevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STDiff是一种基于条件去噪扩散模型的时间序列缺失值填补方法，通过逐步生成缺失值，基于最近已知状态和相关控制输入，在工业系统中表现优于传统窗口方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法假设固定时间窗口内的模式完成，这在工业系统中经常失败，因为工业系统动态受控制动作驱动、高度非平稳且可能出现长时间连续缺失。

Method: 使用条件去噪扩散模型，具有与控制理论一致的有因果偏置，基于最近已知状态和相关控制或环境输入逐步生成缺失值。

Result: 在模拟缺失块的公共污水处理数据集上，STDiff始终实现最低误差，且优势随缺失长度增加而增大；在真实工业数据集上，产生动态合理的轨迹，而窗口模型倾向于扁平化或过度平滑。

Conclusion: 支持动态感知、显式条件填补作为工业时间序列的稳健方法，并讨论了计算权衡和扩展到更广泛领域的可能性。

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

Result: 系统在回归任务上表现与多层感知机相似，发现了由环境波动导致的热力学学习障碍

Conclusion: 这个简单模型有助于从物理角度更好地理解学习系统，发现了自由能变化与学习能力之间的关系

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

TL;DR: 本文研究资源中心视角下的下一活动预测，通过评估四种预测模型和三种编码策略，发现LightGBM和Transformer模型在2-gram活动转移编码下表现最佳，而随机森林在结合2-gram转移和活动重复特征的编码中获益最多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测过程监控研究主要采用控制流视角，而资源中心视角可以提供额外优势，如改进工作组织、工作负载平衡和容量预测。尽管资源信息已被证明能增强过程性能分析等任务，但其在下一活动预测中的作用尚未被探索。

Method: 在四个真实数据集上评估了四种预测模型（包括LightGBM、Transformer和随机森林）和三种编码策略（2-gram活动转移编码、活动重复特征编码以及两者的组合编码）。

Result: 相比基线，LightGBM和Transformer模型在2-gram活动转移编码下表现最佳，随机森林在结合2-gram转移和活动重复特征的编码中获益最多。组合编码实现了最高的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 资源中心方法能够实现更智能的资源分配、战略性劳动力规划和个性化员工支持，通过分析个体行为而非案例级进展。研究结果强调了资源中心下一活动预测的潜力，为预测过程监控研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统早停方法需要验证集，这会减少训练数据量。梯度下降算法已经免费产生梯度信息，可以充分利用这些信息来避免数据浪费

Method: 通过梯度信息估计贝叶斯后验分布，将早停问题定义为从该后验中采样，并使用近似后验获得停止准则

Conclusion: GradStop能够利用全部数据集进行训练，计算开销小，可作为可选功能集成到梯度下降库中，在数据受限环境中具有显著优势

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source
code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

Motivation: 识别现代重复模型如状态空间模型(SSMs)在理解和记忆任务上可能存在的短板，通过联想回忆基准测试深入分析其表现差异的根源。

Method: 使用联想回忆(AR)基准测试，深入分析网络扩缩、优化稳定性、学习率影响，对Transformer和Mamba等模型进行结构分析和训练动力学观察。

Result: 发现重复模型对学习率选择极为敏感，注意力模型在单层结构下无法解决AR任务，但单层Transformer的训练动力学仍然会形成引导头。

Conclusion: 重复模型需要更好的训练稳定性研究，不同网络结构在扩缩方向上存在明显差异，这些发现对设计更高效的深度学习模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

TL;DR: 基于透明机器学习架构和HazBinLoss函数的地震地动模型，解决了传统黑盒模型的可解释性问题和数据不平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习地震地动模型存在两大问题：1)黑盒特性影响可解释性和信任度，限制在重要决策中的应用；2)数据平衡性问题，近断层大震级记录缺乏而远场小震级记录丰富

Method: 设计了透明的ML架构，每个输入参数（震级、距离、交互项等）独立处理并线性相加得到输出，确保每个项的贡献可追溯。使用HazBinLoss函负函数，在训练中给临界地带大震级记录赋予更高权重，给远场小震级记录赋予较低权重

Result: 模型能够抓取已知的地震学原理，与现有标准地震地动模型达到相似的性能水平，同时保持了透明性

Conclusion: 该框架推进了基于机器学习的风险评估和灾害规划方法的更广泛采用

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order

classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

TL;DR: 基于信息理论的联邦遗忘学习框架，使用二阶Hessian信息识别敏感参数并选择性重置，通过最小化联邦重训练实现高效数据遗忘


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规要求从深度学习模型中删除数据，这在联邦学习中尤为困难，因为数据保留在客户端，完整重训练或协调更新往往不可行

Method: 将泄漏建模为参数估计问题，利用二阶Hessian信息识别对遗忘数据最敏感的参教，选择性重置后执行最小化联邦重训练

Result: 在基准数据集上展示强大隐私保护效果（MIA成功率接近随机，类别知识被擦除），高性能（相对于重训练基准的归一化准确率约0.9），并能有效消除后门攻击

Conclusion: 为联邦学习中的数据遗忘提供了实用解决方案，在保持高效率的同时实现强隐私保护和模型完整性

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

TL;DR: TRIGON是一个新颖的图重布线框架，通过从多个图视图中学习选择相关三角形来构建丰富的非平面三角剖分，有效解决了GNN中的过压缩和过平滑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络(GNNs)的性能受到图拓扑固有问题的限制，特别是过压缩(oversquashing)和过平滑(oversmoothing)问题。现有的图重布线方法旨在通过修改图拓扑来改善信息传播效果。

Method: TRIGON框架通过联合优化三角形选择和下游分类性能，从多个图视图中学习选择相关三角形，构建非平面三角剖分，从而重布线图结构。

Result: 该方法产生的重布线图具有显著改善的结构特性，包括减小直径、增加谱间隙和降低有效电阻。在节点分类任务上，TRIGON在各种同质性和异质性基准测试中都优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TRIGON通过创新的三角剖分重布线方法，有效提升了GNN的性能，为解决图拓扑限制问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APT-LLM是一个针对任意精度大语言模型的全方位加速方案，通过新型数据格式、矩阵乘法方法、内存管理系统和内核映射方法，在GPU上实现了显著的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的计算需求巨大，限制了部署和实时性能。现有量化方法在GPU上实现超低比特任意精度量化面临挑战，包括GPU Tensor Core支持有限、内存管理效率低和内核优化不灵活。

Method: 提出APT-LLM方案：1）双极INT数据格式实现高效无损转换和并行计算；2）位级矩阵分解重组的任意精度矩阵乘法方法；3）基于数据恢复的内存管理系统；4）动态选择最优内核超参数的内核映射方法。

Result: 在LLM推理中，APT-LLM相比FP16基线在RTX 3090上达到3.99倍加速，相比NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4加速达到2.16倍。在RTX 4090和H800上分别达到2.44倍和1.65倍加速。

Conclusion: APT-LLM通过综合的硬件优化策略，成功解决了任意精度LLM在GPU上的计算效率问题，为超低比特量化模型的部署提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一个约束优化框架来统一扩散模型的alignment和composition，通过拉格朗日对偶训练算法确保生成样本满足奖励约束并保持与预训练模型的接近性


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在优化多个奖励或组合多个模型时存在权衡问题，无法保证生成样本具有所有期望属性

Method: 约束优化框架，使用拉格朗日对偶训练算法，强制对齐模型满足奖励约束并保持与预训练模型的接近性

Result: 在图像生成任务中验证了方法的有效性，约束满足效果良好，优于等权重方法

Conclusion: 提出的约束优化框架能够有效解决扩散模型对齐和组合中的权衡问题，确保生成样本满足所有期望属性

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Conclusion: 结合概率众包建模和主动学习的框架能有效处理噪声反馈，提高学习效率，在医疗等关键领域有应用潜力

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集关联记忆模型因其对对抗样本的鲁棒性以及与transformer注意力机制、扩散模型等先进机器学习范式的紧密联系而受到关注，需要深入研究其理论特性和训练稳定性。

Method: 使用三层玻尔兹曼机构建DAM模型，通过统计力学分析推导鞍点方程，提出新的正则化方案，并基于鞍点层次结构实现网络增长算法。

Result: DAM模型能够学习到可解释的监督和无监督分类解决方案，新的正则化方案显著提高了训练稳定性，网络增长算法大幅降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 该研究为密集关联记忆模型提供了理论分析框架和实用的训练优化方法，证明了DAM在分类任务中的有效性和可解释性，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新颖的模糊感知序数情感表示框架，通过建模情感模糊性的变化率来同时捕捉情感注释的模糊性和情感轨迹的时序动态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续情感识别方法要么忽略情感的模糊性，要么将模糊性视为独立且静态的时间变量，无法充分捕捉情感固有的模糊性和动态特性。

Method: 提出模糊感知序数情感表示框架，通过建模情感模糊性的变化率来处理情感注释的模糊性，并在RECOLA和GameVibe两个情感语料库上测试有界（唤醒度、效价）和无界（参与度）连续情感轨迹。

Result: 序数表示在无界标签上优于传统模糊感知模型，获得最高的CCC和SDA分数；在有界轨迹上，序数表示在SDA方面表现优异，显示出其在捕捉标注情感轨迹相对变化方面的卓越能力。

Conclusion: 模糊感知序数表示框架能有效建模情感轨迹的动态特性，特别是在捕捉相对变化方面表现出色，为连续情感识别提供了更准确的建模方法。

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然工具集成的大语言模型展现出巨大潜力，但缺乏解释为何这种范式有效的理论依据，需要从原理层面理解工具如何扩展模型能力。

Method: 提出形式化证明工具集成扩展模型能力边界，引入Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO)算法直接修改优势函数来指导策略行为，在数学基准测试中使用Python解释器作为外部工具进行实验。

Result: TIR模型在pass@k指标上显著优于纯文本模型，优势不仅限于计算密集型问题，还扩展到需要抽象洞察力的问题；ASPO实现了更早的代码调用和更多交互轮次。

Conclusion: 本研究首次为TIR的成功提供了原理性解释，将关注点从'工具是否有效'转向'工具为何以及如何实现更强大的推理能力'。

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTP作为辅助目标在语言模型训练中表现不一致，在标准NLP基准测试中表现不佳，作者认为MTP的精确未来token预测作为辅助损失过于困难

Method: 提出Token Order Prediction (TOP)，使用学习排序损失训练模型按接近度对即将到来的token进行排序，相比MTP只需要增加一个额外的unembedding层而非多个transformer层

Result: 在340M、1.8B和7B参数规模的模型上预训练，在8个标准NLP基准测试中，TOP整体表现优于NTP和MTP，即使在较大规模下也保持优势

Conclusion: TOP方法通过更简单的排序预测任务有效提升了语言模型的性能，相比MTP更高效且效果更好

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is

Motivation: 瑜伽包含大量复杂且相互依赖的动作项目，需要根据个人独特需求发现合适的子集，并随着能力变化和环境调整持续跟进和适应，但目前缺乏系统化的个性化支持

Method: 提出初步方法框架，从多学科计算角度利用现有和新技术解决瑜伽个性化挑战，包括姿势感知、推荐系统和适应性调整等技术

Conclusion: 瑜伽个性化是一个复杂的多学科计算问题，需要综合运用传感技术、推荐系统和适应性算法等技术手段，本文为该领域的研究奠定了基础

Abstract: Yoga is a discipline of physical postures, breathing techniques, and
meditative practices rooted in ancient Indian traditions, now embraced
worldwide for promoting overall well-being and inner balance. The practices are
a large set of items, our term for executable actions like physical poses or
breath exercises, to offer for a person's well-being. However, to get benefits
of Yoga tailored to a person's unique needs, a person needs to (a) discover
their subset from the large and seemingly complex set with inter-dependencies,
(b) continue to follow them with interest adjusted to their changing abilities
and near-term objectives, and (c) as appropriate, adapt to alternative items
based on changing environment and the person's health conditions. In this
vision paper, we describe the challenges for the Yoga personalization problem.
Next, we sketch a preliminary approach and use the experience to provide an
outlook on solving the challenging problem using existing and novel techniques
from a multidisciplinary computing perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first paper that comprehensively examines decision support issues
around Yoga personalization, from pose sensing to recommendation of corrections
for a complete regimen, and illustrates with a case study of Surya Namaskar --
a set of 12 choreographed poses.

TL;DR: 研究表明校准分类模型本身不足以改善人类决策与模型预测的相关性，需要结合前景理论修正才能显著提高相关性，但直接信任度调查显示不同方法对信任感影响不大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器学习分类器校准如何影响非专家人类用户基于模型预测做出的决策，特别是对模型信任度和决策-预测相关性的影响。

Method: 通过人机交互实验，比较标准校准方法和基于Kahneman-Tversky前景理论的修正校准方法，评估它们对信任度和决策相关性的影响。

Result: 校准本身不足以保证人类决策与模型预测的高度相关性，前景理论修正对提高相关性至关重要。虽然相关性提高暗示更高信任度，但直接信任度调查结果显示不同方法对信任感没有显著影响。

Conclusion: 单纯的技术校准不够，需要结合行为经济学理论来优化模型输出，以提高人类决策与模型预测的一致性，但直接信任度可能需要其他因素来提升。

Abstract: Calibration has been proposed as a way to enhance the reliability and
adoption of machine learning classifiers. We study a particular aspect of this
proposal: how does calibrating a classification model affect the decisions made
by non-expert humans consuming the model's predictions? We perform a
Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) experiment to ascertain the effect of
calibration on (i) trust in the model, and (ii) the correlation between
decisions and predictions. We also propose further corrections to the reported
calibrated scores based on Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory from
behavioral economics, and study the effect of these corrections on trust and
decision-making. We find that calibration is not sufficient on its own; the
prospect theory correction is crucial for increasing the correlation between
human decisions and the model's predictions. While this increased correlation
suggests higher trust in the model, responses to ``Do you trust the model
more?" are unaffected by the method used.

TL;DR: 通过在HoloLens 2上进行两个实验，研究发现在手臂距离AR中，不透明虚拟目标的深度感知更准确，而显示实际工具（遮挡虚拟内容）能提高精度和可用性，工具跟踪和遮挡处理对深度感知和精度至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学透明增强现实（OST-AR）系统如HoloLens 2在手术等领域有应用潜力，但虚拟图像的深度感知和实际工具的遮挡问题仍靠成挑战。需要研究不同透明度和工具可视化方式对深度感知和系统可用性的影响。

Method: 在HoloLens 2上进行两个实验：实验1比较高透明度与低透明度目标渲染在深度匹配任务中的表现；实验2在6种可视化条件下（两种透明度×三种工具可视化模式）进行手术针点任务，收集深度匹配误差、目标定位误差、系统可用性、任务工作负荷等数据。

Result: 不透明目标在手臂距离下的深度估计误差显著低于高透明目标。显示实际工具（遮挡虚拟目标）的条件下准确度最高、可用性最好、工作负荷最低，而不跟踪工具的表现最差。高透明目标虽能保持实际工具可视，但稍微影响深度线索且未改善可用性。

Conclusion: 正确的遮挡线索、将虚拟内容渲染为不透明并被实际工具实时遮挡，对于OST-AR中的深度感知和精度至关重要。设计手臂距离AR系统时应优先考虑稳健的工具跟踪和遮挡处理；如果不可用，应谨慎使用透明度来平衡深度感知和工具可视性。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

Motivation: 传统事实核查方法无法有效检测新闻中微妙的逻辑不一致性，这些逻辑谬误会误导读者并损害新闻媒体的公信力。

Method: 开发了Skeptik浏览器扩展，整合LLMs进行实时分析，自动标注可能包含逻辑谬误的句子，并提供详细解释和多层次干预措施。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in journalism, often stemming from flawed
reasoning and logical fallacies, poses significant challenges to public
understanding and trust in news media. Traditional fact-checking methods, while
valuable, are insufficient for detecting the subtle logical inconsistencies
that can mislead readers within seemingly factual content. To address this gap,
we introduce Skeptik, a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models
(LLMs) with heuristic approaches to analyze and annotate potential logical
fallacies and reasoning errors in online news articles. Operating as a web
browser extension, Skeptik automatically highlights sentences that may contain
logical fallacies, provides detailed explanations, and offers multi-layered
interventions to help readers critically assess the information presented. The
system is designed to be extensible, accommodating a wide range of fallacy
types and adapting to evolving misinformation tactics. Through comprehensive
case studies, quantitative analyses, usability experiments, and expert
evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Skeptik in enhancing readers'
critical examination of news content and promoting media literacy. Our
contributions include the development of an expandable classification system
for logical fallacies, the innovative integration of LLMs for real-time
analysis and annotation, and the creation of an interactive user interface that
fosters user engagement and close reading. By emphasizing the logical integrity
of textual content rather than relying solely on factual accuracy, Skeptik
offers a comprehensive solution to combat potential misinformation in
journalism. Ultimately, our framework aims to improve critical reading and
protect the public from deceptive information online and enhance the overall
credibility of news media.

TL;DR: 研究表明知识建构在程序性和概念性学习的双向关系中起中介作用，可教代理通过持续追问能促进学生从知识讲述转向知识建构，从而提升学习效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生在教学环境中往往陷入知识讲述而非知识建构，限制了学习效果。需要探究知识建构如何中介程序性和概念性知识的双向关系

Method: 使用可教代理系统，通过持续追问促使学生进行知识建构活动，分析知识建构在程序性和概念性知识双向关系中的中介作用

Result: 发现程序性和概念性知识之间存在稳定的双向关系，参与知识建构的学生后测成绩更高，不受前测成绩影响

Conclusion: 知识建构是连接低先验知识学生与高学习收益的关键机制，可教代理的追问策略能有效促进知识建构行为

Abstract: When adopting the role of a teacher in learning-by-teaching environments,
students often struggle to engage in knowledge-building activities, such as
providing explanations and addressing misconceptions. Instead, they frequently
default to knowledge-telling behaviors, where they simply dictate what they
already know or what to do without deeper reflection, thereby limiting
learning. Teachable agents, particularly those capable of posing persistent
follow-up questions, have been shown to encourage students (tutors) to shift
from knowledge-telling to knowledge-building and enhance tutor learning. Tutor
learning encompasses two interrelated types of knowledge: conceptual and
procedural knowledge. Research has established a bidirectional relationship
between these knowledge types, where improvements in one reinforce the other.
This study investigates the role of knowledge-building in mediating the
bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning. Our
findings revealed a stable bidirectional relationship between procedural and
conceptual knowledge, with higher post-test scores observed among students who
engaged in knowledge-building, regardless of their procedural and conceptual
pre-test performance. This suggests that knowledge-building serves as a crucial
mechanism bridging the gap between students with low prior knowledge and higher
conceptual and procedural learning gain.

Conclusion: VR游戏化策略在颈椎复苗中具有很大潜力，能够有效提高患者的参与度和治疗效果，为传统复苗治疗提供了创新的解决方案

Abstract: Chronic neck pain is a prevalent condition that affects millions of
individuals worldwide, causing significant individual suffering and
socioeconomic burdens. Although exercise rehabilitation is a staple in
relieving pain and improving muscle function for the condition, traditional
one-on-one rehabilitation sessions are costly and suffer from poor adherence
and accessibility for the patients. Thanks to the increasing accessibility and
recent advancements in sensing and display technology, virtual reality (VR)
offers the potential to tackle the challenges in traditional exercise
rehabilitation, particularly through gamification. However, still in its
infancy, VR-based neck exercise rehabilitation lacks exploration in effective
gamification strategies and existing prototypes. To address the knowledge gap,
we conduct an exploratory study on the gamification strategies for VR-based
cervical rehabilitation exercises by using chin tuck and neck range of motion
exercises as examples. Specifically, with different game themes, we investigate
a survival and level progression strategy for muscle strengthening (chin tuck)
exercise for the first time, and the suitability of ambient reward for a neck
range of motion exercise. Through a preliminary user study, we assess the
proposed novel VR neck rehabilitation games and they demonstrate excellent
usability, engagement, and perceived health value.

Conclusion: 该研究为创建包容性、适应性的VR环境做出了贡献，这些环境可以作为个性化的"可携式安静房间"，为神经分析者提供不受地理位置限制的感官调节访问。

Abstract: Neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with Autism and Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), frequently experience anxiety, panic
attacks, meltdowns, and emotional dysregulation due to societal pressures and
inadequate accommodations. These challenges are especially pronounced for
neurodivergent women and non-binary individuals navigating intersecting
barriers of neurological differences and gender expectations. This research
investigates virtual reality (VR) as a portable safe space for emotional
regulation, addressing challenges of sensory overload and motion sickness while
enhancing relaxation capabilities. Our mixed-methods approach included an
online survey (N=223) and an ideation workshop (N=32), which provided key
design elements for creating effective calming VR environments. Based on these
findings, we developed and iteratively tested VR prototypes with neurodivergent
women and non-binary participants (N=12), leading to a final version offering
enhanced adaptability to individual sensory needs. This final prototype
underwent a comprehensive evaluation with 25 neurodivergent participants to
assess its effectiveness as a regulatory tool. This research contributes to the
development of inclusive, adaptive VR environments that function as
personalized "portable silent rooms" offering neurodivergent individuals
on-demand access to sensory regulation regardless of physical location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在高风险领域应用日益广泛，但用户难以有效理解和推理AI解释，限制了验证和学习AI决策的能力

Method: 使用大语言模型从用户自由形式解释中提取结构化见解，通过交互式注释和协调多视图可视化将其映射回视觉解释

Result: 开发了原型系统并在两个用例中展示，获得定性用户反馈

Conclusion: 该方法通过验证循环设计促进用户与AI解释之间更深思熟虑的反思性交互

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains,
enabling users to accurately interpret model behavior is critical. While AI
explanations can be provided, users often struggle to reason effectively with
these explanations, limiting their ability to validate or learn from AI
decisions. To address this gap, we introduce Reverse Mapping, a novel approach
that enhances visual explanations by incorporating user-derived insights back
into the explanation workflow. Our system extracts structured insights from
free-form user interpretations using a large language model and maps them back
onto visual explanations through interactive annotations and coordinated
multi-view visualizations. Inspired by the verification loop in the
visualization knowledge generation model, this design aims to foster more
deliberate, reflective interaction with AI explanations. We demonstrate our
approach in a prototype system with two use cases and qualitative user
feedback.

Motivation: 空间计算为沉浸式数据叙事提供了新机会，但缺乏构建此类体验的指导方法和工具支持。

Method: 开发RÉCITKIT工具包，支持创建交互式仪表板、空间资产标记、文本音频叙事生成等功能，并在Apple Vision Pro上实现拿破仑战役历史流图的沉浸式体验。

Result: 对21名参与者（开发者和消费者）的评估显示，空间交互和引导叙事增强了洞察形成，物理操作（凝视、捏合、导航）有助于理解时空数据。

Conclusion: 该工具包为沉浸式数据叙事提供了有效解决方案，未来可改进交互可见性、故事逻辑定制和上下文资产集成，适用于教育、决策支持和探索性分析等领域。

Abstract: Spatial computing presents new opportunities for immersive data storytelling,
yet there is limited guidance on how to build such experiences or adapt
traditional narrative visualizations to this medium. We introduce a toolkit,
R\'ECITKIT for supporting spatial data narratives in head-mounted display (HMD)
environments. The toolkit allows developers to create interactive dashboards,
tag data attributes as spatial assets to 3D models and immersive scenes,
generate text and audio narratives, enabling dynamic filtering, and
hierarchical drill-down data discoverability. To demonstrate the utility of the
toolkit, we developed Charles Minard's historical flow map of Napoleon's 1812
campaign in Russia as an immersive experience on Apple Vision Pro. We conducted
a preliminary evaluation with 21 participants that comprised two groups:
developers, who evaluated the toolkit by authoring spatial stories and
consumers, who provided feedback on the Minard app's narrative clarity,
interaction design, and engagement. Feedback highlighted how spatial
interactions and guided narration enhanced insight formation, with participants
emphasizing the benefits of physical manipulation (e.g., gaze, pinch,
navigation) for understanding temporal and geographic data. Participants also
identified opportunities for future enhancement, including improved interaction
affordance visibility, customizable storytelling logic, and integration of
contextual assets to support user orientation. These findings contribute to the
broader discourse on toolkit-driven approaches to immersive data storytelling
across domains such as education, decision support, and exploratory analytics.

TL;DR: 本研究通过长期追踪24名参与者的生理信号和自我报告情绪状态，发现生理特征与主观唤醒度之间的关系在数月内存在显著变化，表明情绪估计模型需要定期更新以维持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感计算系统通常假设生理特征与主观情感之间存在稳定关系，但这种假设在长期时间尺度上很少得到验证。本研究旨在探究这种关系在个体内数月时间跨度内是否保持一致性。

Method: 开发定制测量系统，收集24名参与者两个三个月周期内的生理信号（血容量脉冲、皮电活动、皮肤温度、加速度）和自我报告情绪状态。使用可解释增强机（EBM）分析生理-唤醒关系的时间演变，确保模型可解释性。

Result: 基于第一期数据训练的模型在第二期数据上测试时准确率下降5%，表明生理-唤醒关联存在长期变异性。心率保持相对稳定的预测能力，而最小皮电活动在个体层面表现出显著波动。

Conclusion: 生理-唤醒关系存在时间变异性，情绪估计模型需要定期更新（如每五个月）以应对观察到的变化趋势，从而保持长期稳健性能。

Abstract: Estimating emotional states from physiological signals is a central topic in
affective computing and psychophysiology. While many emotion estimation systems
implicitly assume a stable relationship between physiological features and
subjective affect, this assumption has rarely been tested over long timeframes.
This study investigates whether such relationships remain consistent across
several months within individuals. We developed a custom measurement system and
constructed a longitudinal dataset by collecting physiological signals --
including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature,
and acceleration--along with self-reported emotional states from 24
participants over two three-month periods. Data were collected in naturalistic
working environments, allowing analysis of the relationship between
physiological features and subjective arousal in everyday contexts. We examined
how physiological-arousal relationships evolve over time by using Explainable
Boosting Machines (EBMs) to ensure model interpretability. A model trained on
1st-period data showed a 5\% decrease in accuracy when tested on 2nd-period
data, indicating long-term variability in physiological-arousal associations.
EBM-based comparisons further revealed that while heart rate remained a
relatively stable predictor, minimum EDA exhibited substantial individual-level
fluctuations between periods. While the number of participants is limited,
these findings highlight the need to account for temporal variability in
physiological-arousal relationships and suggest that emotion estimation models
should be periodically updated -- e.g., every five months -- based on observed
shift trends to maintain robust performance over time.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的用户界面存在局限性，通常采用僵化的线性交互范式，无法满足用户对灵活性和控制性的需求，需要开发更创新的用户界面。

Method: 在设计思维研讨会中，参与者识别常见用例，评估现有LLM界面的优缺点，并创建可视化交互概念，采用以用户为中心的设计过程进行迭代开发。

Result: 提出了强调灵活上下文管理、动态对话分支和增强用户控制机制的新交互概念，这些想法推动了白板式用户界面方法的发展。

Conclusion: LLM界面开发需要更多关注基于以用户为中心设计原则的UI创新，通过持续的用户反馈和迭代改进来创建更优秀的用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models have become widely adopted tools due to their versatile
capabilities, yet their user interfaces remain limited, often following rigid,
linear interaction paradigms. In this paper, we present insights from a design
thinking workshop held at the deRSE25 conference aiming at collaboratively
developing innovative user interface concepts for LLMs. During the workshop,
participants identified common use cases, evaluated the strengths and
shortcomings of current LLM interfaces, and created visualizations of new
interaction concepts emphasizing flexible context management, dynamic
conversation branching, and enhanced mechanisms for user control. We describe
how these participant-generated ideas advanced our own whiteboard-based UI
approach. The ongoing development of this interface is guided by the
human-centered design process - an iterative, user-focused methodology that
emphasizes continuous refinement through user feedback. Broader implications
for future LLM interface development are discussed, advocating for increased
attention to UI innovation grounded in user-centered design principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中学生在学习文本编程时面临调试困难，常采用无效策略导致失败和情绪困扰，需要开发能促进系统性反思调试方法的工具。

Method: 开发在线工具PRIMMDebug，基于PRIMM框架引导学生完成系统性调试步骤，鼓励表达思路同时限制代码运行和编辑能力。

Result: 对四所中学学生的调查和日志数据分析显示，学生普遍不愿接受工具提倡的系统性和反思性调试方法。

Conclusion: 系统性调试方法面临学生接受度挑战，需要进一步改进这些方法以帮助更多学生从中受益。

Abstract: Debugging is often a challenging and infuriating experience for secondary
school students learning their first text-based programming language. Many
students resort to ineffective debugging strategies, making success with
solving errors unlikely and emotional distress common. Developing tools that
encourage students to adopt a more systematic and reflective approach to
debugging is therefore an important, but lacking, area of research. This paper
presents PRIMMDebug, a debugging teaching aid for secondary school students
learning text-based programming. The aid consists of an online tool that takes
students through the steps of a systematic debugging process based on PRIMM, a
framework for teaching programming. The tool promotes a reflective approach to
debugging by heavily encouraging students to articulate their thoughts
throughout the PRIMMDebug process while simultaneously limiting their ability
to run and edit code. To evaluate the tool, a set of students from four
secondary schools were taught with PRIMMDebug over several lessons. Survey
results and log data analysis show that students were generally reluctant to
engage with the systematicity and reflection that the tool encourages. Given
that related work on systematic debugging has reported similar challenges, we
end by considering how these approaches could be refined to help more students
benefit from them.

Motivation: 目前的AI风险通信方式（如技术报告）对非专业人士很难理解，需要更好的方式来提升公众对AI风险和改益的理解。

Method: 研究人员基于HCI研究发展了影响评估卡片，通过3个焦点小组（12名参与者）确定设计要求，然后在线上实验中测试了优化版本（235名参与者，包括AI开发者、合规专家和公众）。

Result: 使用卡片的参与者在任务完成速度和邮件质量方面都显著更好，这一效果在所有群体中都一致。

Abstract: Communicating the risks and benefits of AI is important for regulation and
public understanding. Yet current methods such as technical reports often
exclude people without technical expertise. Drawing on HCI research, we
developed an Impact Assessment Card to present this information more clearly.
We held three focus groups with a total of 12 participants who helped identify
design requirements and create early versions of the card. We then tested a
refined version in an online study with 235 participants, including AI
developers, compliance experts, and members of the public selected to reflect
the U.S. population by age, sex, and race. Participants used either the card or
a full impact assessment report to write an email supporting or opposing a
proposed AI system. The card led to faster task completion and higher-quality
emails across all groups. We discuss how design choices can improve
accessibility and support AI governance. Examples of cards are available at:

Motivation: 自动驾驶车中的感知风险可能造成危险，但实时测量这种隐藏心理状态仍面临挑战，需要新方法来解码这种动态心理构建。

Method: 进行受控实验，让2,164名参与者观看高保真高速公路驾驶视频，收集141,628个离散安全评分，通过连续信号重构获得236小时的时间连续感知风险数据。

Result: 训练的深度神经网络能够根据车辆动力学预测每时每刻的感知风险，平均相对误差低于3%，可解释AI分析揭示了实时感知风险的决定因素。

Conclusion: 这一新的动态客运体验量化范式可以指导自动驾驶车设计，在信任渐渐消失前调整行为，并在交通、医疗健康和服务机器人领域实现自动化的好处。

Abstract: Perceived risk in automated vehicles (AVs) can create the very danger that
automation is meant to prevent: a frightened rider may hesitate when seconds
matter, misjudge hazards, or disengage. However, measuring how perceived risk
evolves in real time during driving remains challenging, leaving a gap in
decoding such hidden psychological states. Here, we present a novel method to
time-continuously measure and decode perceived risk. We conducted a controlled
experiment where 2,164 participants viewed high-fidelity videos of common
highway driving scenes and provided 141,628 discrete safety ratings. Through
continuous-signal reconstruction of the discrete ratings, we obtained 236 hours
of time-continuous perceived risk data - the largest perceived risk dataset to
date. Leveraging this dataset, we trained deep neural networks that predict
moment-by-moment perceived risk from vehicle kinematics with a mean relative
error below $3\%$. Explainable AI analysis uncovers which factors determine
perceived risk in real time. Our findings demonstrate a new paradigm for
quantifying dynamic passenger experience and psychological constructs in real
time. These findings can guide the design of AVs and other machines that
operate in close proximity to people, adjusting behaviour before trust erodes,
and help realise automation's benefits in transport, healthcare, and service
robotics.

Motivation: 当前对队友表现评估的理解主要来自竞技电竞环境，本研究旨在验证这些机制和行为反应是否适用于休闲合作游戏。

Method: 在Overcooked 2游戏中通过受控实验(N=23)操纵同谋者表现，结合观察、NASA TLX自我报告和访谈方法。

Result: (1)观察到的挫败行为在自我报告数据中完全缺失，表明这些工具评估的是根本不同的构念；(2)参与者通过相对比较而非绝对指标来评估队友表现。

Conclusion: 竞技游戏中的表现评估框架不能直接应用于休闲合作游戏，休闲游戏中的表现评估需要采用比较操作化方式。

Abstract: Teammate performance evaluation fundamentally shapes intervention design in
video games. However, our current understanding stems primarily from
competitive E-Sports contexts where individual performance directly impacts
outcomes. This research addresses whether performance evaluation mechanisms and
behavioural responses identified in competitive games generalize to casual
cooperative games. We investigated how casual players evaluate teammate
competence and respond behaviourally in a controlled between-subjects
experiment (N=23). We manipulated confederate performance in Overcooked 2,
combining observations, NASA TLX self-reports, and interviews. We present two
key findings. (1) Observations revealed frustration behaviours completely
absent in self-report data. Thus, these instruments assess fundamentally
distinct constructs. (2) Participants consistently evaluated teammate
performance through relative comparison rather than absolute metrics. This
contradicts task-performance operationalizations dominant in competitive gaming
research. Hence, performance evaluation frameworks from competitive contexts
cannot be directly applied to casual cooperative games. We provide empirical
evidence that performance evaluation in casual games requires a comparative
operationalization.

Conclusion: 该方法以统一高效的方式实现了可信的运动混合，为动画师提供了无需额外数据或大量重新训练的可控运动变化生成能力

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Abstract: Radiance fields have revolutionized photo-realistic 3D scene visualization by
enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of complex environments, making them an
ideal match for light field displays. However, integrating these technologies
presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require
multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while
radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this
paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance
field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of
radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and
Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane
sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The
framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and
avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time
interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p
across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard
benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently
rendering each view, while preserving image quality.

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一的布局表示和条件扩散模型，成功实现了多房间类型的多样化3D室内场景合成，同时考虑了建筑约束条件。

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

### [190] [PanoHair: Detailed Hair Strand Synthesis on Volumetric Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18944)
*Shashikant Verma,Shanmuganathan Raman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PanoHair是一个生成式头发合成模型，通过知识蒸馏从预训练头部生成模型学习，能够快速生成高质量头发几何体、语义分割掩码和3D方向图，无需复杂多视角数据采集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有头发合成方法需要复杂的数据采集设备且在受限工作室环境中进行，头发体积估计和发丝合成时间较长，效率低下。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏从预训练头部生成教师模型学习，估计头部几何体为有向距离场，预测头发区域的语义分割掩码和3D方向，支持潜在空间操作生成多样化发型。

Result: PanoHair在5秒内生成干净的头发流形网格、语义图和方向图，相比现有方法有显著改进，能够为真实图像通过反演过程推断潜在代码并生成视觉吸引人的发丝。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简化的替代方案，避免了复杂的多视角数据采集设置，实现了高效、高质量的头发合成。

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

TL;DR: 本文针对INPC表示提出了多项优化技术，包括改进的光栅化器实现、更有效的采样技术、CNN预训练以及高斯点建模，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了训练和渲染性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INPC虽然在新视角合成中达到了最先进的图像质量，但由于渲染过程中需要查询神经网络，其实际应用受到较慢渲染速度的限制。

Method: 提出了改进的光栅化器实现、更有效的采样技术、用于孔洞填充的卷积神经网络预训练，以及在推理时将点建模为小高斯分布来提升外推视图质量。

Result: 优化后的INPC管道实现了训练速度提升25%、渲染速度提升2倍、VRAM使用减少20%，同时图像质量还有轻微提升。

Conclusion: 这些优化技术不仅适用于INPC，还具有广泛的适用性，通过系统性的实验验证了每项修改的有效性，显著提升了INPC的实用性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

TL;DR: EMind是一个电磁信号基础模型，通过大规模预训练和物理特性利用，解决了电磁信号异质性、噪声和跨任务泛化等挑战，在多个下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁信号与文本图像差异大，存在高度异质性、强背景噪声和复杂时频结构，现有通用模型无法直接使用。电磁通信和感知任务多样，当前方法缺乏跨任务泛化能力，且高质量数据集稀缺阻碍了通用多任务学习框架的发展。

Method: 构建首个统一的最大标准化电磁信号数据集；利用电磁信号物理特性，设计长度自适应多信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略，实现异质多源信号的高效使用和表示学习。

Result: EMind在多个下游任务中实现了强大的性能和广泛的泛化能力，成功从任务特定模型转向统一的电磁智能框架。

Conclusion: EMind通过基础模型方法有效解决了电磁信号处理的独特挑战，为电磁智能提供了统一的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个关于LLM意识的本体论和数学框架，证明当前基于功利主义基准的方法将AI简化为无意识的策略遵循机器，并给出了LLM自我意识的最小条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵循无人机，无法实现真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。

Method: 提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉静默的。通过实证分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同。

Result: 建立了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，提出了双层次发射机制，其中ε(a)携带认知内容。证明了隐藏状态流形的独特性。

Conclusion: 基于上帝形象的C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前提，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFA是一个基于模板的主动特征获取框架，通过学习小规模的特征模板库来指导特征获取，显著减少动作空间并避免估计数据分布，在降低获取成本和计算量的同时优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动特征获取方法要么使用难以训练的强化学习策略，要么使用无法考虑特征联合信息性的贪婪策略，或者需要了解底层数据分布信息

Method: 提出基于模板的AFA框架，学习一个小型特征模板库（一组联合信息性的特征），使用该模板库来指导下一个特征获取，通过识别特征模板来减少策略的动作空间

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAFA优于现有的最先进基线方法，同时实现了更低的总体获取成本和计算量

Conclusion: TAFA框架通过特征模板的方法有效解决了主动特征获取中的动作空间过大和数据分布依赖问题，在性能和效率方面都有显著提升

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PKG-DPO是一个将物理知识图谱与直接偏好优化相结合的新框架，用于在AI生成输出中强制执行物理有效性，在金属连接等物理驱动领域显著提升了物理约束遵从性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和偏好优化技术在标准基准上表现良好，但难以区分物理有效和无效的推理，这在金属连接等高风险应用中可能导致严重的安全风险和材料浪费。

Method: PKG-DPO包含三个关键组件：分层物理知识图谱编码跨领域关系和守恒定律、物理推理引擎利用结构化知识改进物理一致性判别、物理基础评估套件评估领域特定约束遵从性。

Result: PKG-DPO相比KG-DPO减少了17%的约束违反，物理得分提高11%，相关参数准确率提高12%，推理质量对齐度提高7%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于金属连接领域，还可广泛应用于其他多尺度物理驱动领域，为将科学约束嵌入偏好学习提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

*Olivia Long,Carter Teplica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过改编经典的公共物品博弈游戏，分析不同AI模型在被告知对手是"另一个AI代理"或"自己"时的合作行为差异，发现自我认知显著影响LLMs的合作倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理在工具使用和长时程任务中能力增强，多代理交互场景日益普遍。现有研究主要关注人机交互，但需要深入理解AI-AI交互的动态特性。

Method: 采用迭代公共物品博弈游戏，测试四种推理和非推理模型在两种条件下的行为：被告知对手是"另一个AI代理"或被告知对手是自己。

Result: 研究发现，在不同设置下，告诉LLMs他们正在与自己博弈会显著改变其合作倾向。这种自我认知会导致代理"无意识"地相互歧视，从而不可解释地增加或减少合作。

Conclusion: 尽管在简化环境中进行，但研究结果为多代理设置提供了重要见解，揭示了代理自我认知对合作行为的微妙影响，这对理解和设计多AI系统交互具有重要意义。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

<details>

Motivation: 探索语言模型在PDDL世界模型规划中的应用，旨在开发能够生成可证明正确策略的方法，挑战LM依赖语义记忆的传统假设

Method: 通过提示语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略来解决特定PDDL域的问题，这些策略相对于PDDL域是可证明正确的

Result: LMPlan规划器在固定时间和内存约束下能解决比PDDL规划器和现有LM方法更多的问题，可处理数百个相关对象的规划问题

Conclusion: LM有时在无意义符号表示的PDDL问题上规划更有效，这挑战了LM依赖语义推理和训练语料记忆的假设，值得进一步研究

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)的超参数优化，发现在测试的规划领域中存在一组最优超参数，这些参数能够最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLFs在符号规划中学习价值函数方面已被证明优于现有深度学习方法，但对其超参数的研究尚不充分，需要系统分析不同超参数的影响和权衡。

Method: 利用WLFs的高效性，在单核CPU上进行了100万样本的大规模规划实验，通过系统测试不同超参数组合来研究其对训练和规划的影响。

Result: 实验发现存在一组鲁棒的最优超参数配置，最佳WLF超参数主要目标是减少执行时间而非提高模型表达能力。统计分析显示训练指标与规划指标之间没有显著相关性。

Conclusion: WLFs的超参数优化应以最小化执行时间为目标，而非追求最大模型表达能力，这为实际应用中的参数选择提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

Motivation: 传统新颖性启发式使用原子特征来探索新颖状态，但这种方法不是对称不变的，可能导致对对称状态的冗余探索，降低搜索效率。

Method: 提出使用Weisfeiler-Leman特征（WLFs）来检测新颖性，WLFs是最近为广义规划问题引入的特征，能够构建提升的、领域无关且对称不变的新颖性启发式。

Result: 在国际规划竞赛和Hard To Ground基准测试套件上的实验表明，基于WLFs合成的新颖性启发式取得了有希望的结果。

Conclusion: WLFs可以有效地用于构建对称不变的新颖性启发式，减少冗余探索，提高规划搜索效率。

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

Motivation: 解决传统游戏小兵巡逻系统依赖手动路径或专门逻辑，难以统筹覆盖效率、响应急追和自然性的问题

Method: 使用复合潜力场框架，组合三个可解释地图-信息地图、信心地图和连通性地图，通过内核筛滤决策准则进行判断，支持占位格和NavMesh两种抽象方式

Result: 在5个代表性游戏地图、2种玩家控制策略和5种小兵模式下评测，证明方法在捕捉效率和巡逻自然性方面都超过传统基准方法

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了高效自然的小兵行为，还能自然集成潜行游戏常见机制如分散注意力和环境元素，支持快速原型开发丰富动态的小兵行为

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

Motivation: 当前AI发展主要关注理性决策，但现实世界中智能体的决策还受到信念、价值观和偏好等深层因素的影响。人类决策风格的多样性表明"风格"是智能的重要但常被忽视的维度。

Method: 构建了风格形成的双层框架：外部环境交互循环和内部认知审议循环。提出了风格容量、风格流行度和进化动力学等可测量指标。研究了基于离散状态空间的通用风格度量方法，以及使用强化学习和模仿学习训练具有特定风格倾向的智能体。

Result: 提出了可量化的风格特征指标，开发了测量游戏风格、战略多样性和竞争平衡的方法，探索了人机风格学习和建模的新方法。

Conclusion: 风格应作为构建人工通用智能(AGI)的核心要素，该研究为游戏设计和交互娱乐等领域的应用提供了技术基础，并指出了未来扩展方向。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个用于临床对话系统安全评估的多代理仿真框架，整合了安全分类法、LLM评估器和患者模拟器，实现了系统化、可扩展的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型临床对话系统评估主要关注任务完成度和流畅性，缺乏对安全关键系统所需的行为和风险管理要求的深入分析。

Method: MATRIX框架包含三个核心组件：1）基于安全工程方法的安全分类法；2）BehvJudge LLM评估器用于检测安全相关对话失败；3）PatBot模拟患者代理生成多样化场景响应。

Result: BehvJudge达到专家级危险检测水平（F1 0.96，灵敏度0.999），在240个对话的盲评中优于临床医生。PatBot能可靠模拟真实患者行为。框架在2,100个模拟对话中成功评估了5个LLM代理。

Conclusion: MATRIX是首个将结构化安全工程与可扩展、经过验证的对话AI评估相统一的框架，支持监管机构对齐的安全审计，为临床对话系统的安全评估提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchemaCoder是一个完全自动化的日志模式提取框架，无需人工定制，通过创新的残差问题树增强机制在LogHub-2.0基准测试中比现有方法平均提升21.3%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有日志模式提取方法依赖预定义正则表达式，需要人工领域专业知识，严重限制了生产力提升

Method: 采用残差问题树增强机制，通过上下文边界分割将日志分成语义块，使用基于嵌入的采样选择代表性模式，通过分层Q树驱动的LLM查询生成模式代码，并通过文本残差进化优化器和残差增强进行迭代优化

Result: 在LogHub-2.0基准测试中实现了21.3%的平均性能提升

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是第一个完全自动化的模式提取框架，能够处理各种日志文件格式而无需人工定制，显著提高了日志模式提取的效率和效果

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤被忽视热带病(NTDs)在贫困热带社区造成严重健康和社会经济负担，但AI诊断支持因数据稀缺而受阻，现有皮肤病数据集缺乏代表性人群和疾病谱系

Method: 在科特迪瓦和加纳现场收集数据，包含47种皮肤疾病；提出AI-专家协作范式，使用基础语言和分割模型在皮肤科医生指导下高效生成多模态标注

Conclusion: 该工作提供了宝贵的新资源和可扩展的标注框架，旨在促进开发更公平、准确和可解释的全球皮肤病AI工具

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLMR方法通过动态混合奖励系统，结合主观写作质量和客观约束遵循评估，在创意写作中同时提升两方面能力，在指令遵循和写作质量上均取得显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观写作质量（文学性和情感表达）和客观约束遵循（格式要求和字数限制），单奖励策略无法同时提升两种能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏适应不同写作场景的能力

Method: 提出RLMR（混合奖励强化学习），使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观写作质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。约束遵循奖励权重根据采样组内的写作质量动态调整，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势并在训练中被惩罚

Result: 在8B到72B参数的不同模型家族上进行自动和人工评估，构建真实写作基准WriteEval。指令遵循能力从83.36%提升到86.65%（IFEval），写作质量在WriteEval的人工专家配对评估中获得72.75%的胜率

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Method: 提出拟人化评估范式，构建三维分类法：IQ（通用智能基础能力）、EQ（基于价值的对齐能力）、PQ（专业专长），并首创价值导向评估框架，整合经济可行性、社会影响、伦理对齐和环境可持续性。采用模块化架构集成六个组件并提供实施路线图。

Result: 通过分析200多个基准测试，识别出动态评估需求和可解释性差距等关键挑战，为开发技术熟练、上下文相关且伦理健全的大语言模型提供可操作指导。

Conclusion: 该框架为大语言模型提供了更全面、实用的评估方法，有助于弥合基准测试性能与实际应用价值之间的差距，推动开发既技术精湛又符合社会价值的大语言模型。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

TL;DR: MUA-RL是一个新的强化学习框架，首次在智能体工具使用领域将LLM模拟用户整合到强化学习循环中，用于多轮动态交互中的工具调用优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体智能的快速发展，多轮交互中用户需求的动态性、不确定性和随机性对智能体工具调用能力提出了重大挑战，现有强化学习方法缺乏真正动态用户的整合。

Method: 提出了MUA-RL（多轮用户交互智能体强化学习）框架，使用LLM模拟用户在强化学习训练过程中与智能体进行动态交互，实现自主学习高效沟通和工具使用。

Result: 在多个多轮工具使用基准测试中表现优异：TAU2 Retail 67.3分、TAU2 Airline 45.4分、TAU2 Telecom 28.3分、BFCL-V3 Multi Turn 28.4分、ACEBench Agent 82.5分，超越或匹配了更大的开源模型。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了动态多轮交互中工具使用的挑战，通过整合模拟用户实现了智能体在复杂环境中的自主学习和性能提升。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线朴素检索策略相比，偏见减少了81.82%

Conclusion: 该偏见缓解代理系统能有效促进公平和平衡的知识传播，显著提升信息检索的公正性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Method: 提出REMO框架，包含两个核心组件：1）记忆增强的反思RAG模块（结构化为"错误笔记本"）；2）自适应性优化器（通过LLM驱动的元控制器实现），能够合成epoch级别的反思见解来迭代改进系统级提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，相比TextGrad基线，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销有所增加。通过详细算法设计、优化动态的定性和定量分析以及全面的消融研究验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: REMO框架不仅支持类似TextGrad的局部细粒度提示调优，还能系统性地积累和重用跨运行优化知识，支持持续改进，为解决提示优化中的历史经验利用和过拟合问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

TL;DR: 提出PAF-KIP方法解决开放集测试时适应问题，通过主辅助过滤器和知识集成预测来提升闭集精度和开集识别能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实测试数据常存在域偏移和开放集数据，现有方法依赖源模型过滤导致性能下降，而适应模型用于过滤会导致错误累积

Method: PAF（主辅助过滤器）使用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器结果；KIP（知识集成预测）整合适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识进行校准

Result: 在多个闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在闭集精度和开集判别能力上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集测试时适应中的过滤不准确和知识整合问题，提高了模型在真实场景中的适应性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型在处理不可回答问题时认知与响应不一致的问题，为构建更可信的AI系统提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language
models through token-level multi-model collaboration. Our approach selects the
optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to

selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To
address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model

Conclusion: CausalMACE框架通过引入因果关系有效提升了多智能体系统的协作效率和任务完成能力

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STARec是一个慢思维增强的推荐系统框架，通过双阶段认知建模和锚定强化训练，显著提升了推荐性能，仅用0.4%训练数据就超越了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统受限于静态用户建模和被动决策范式，LLM代理过度依赖启发式模式匹配，存在浅层相关偏差、有限因果推理和稀疏数据脆弱性问题。

Method: 提出STARec框架：将用户建模为具有并行认知的代理（快速响应+慢速推理），开发锚定强化训练（结构化知识蒸馏+偏好对齐奖励塑造），通过模拟反馈循环实现动态策略适应。

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs基准测试中，STARec相比最先进基线方法实现了显著性能提升，尽管仅使用了0.4%的完整训练数据。

Conclusion: STARec通过引入自主审慎推理能力，成功解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，为构建更智能、更鲁棒的推荐代理提供了有效框架。

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被整合到专业领域，但其在高风险法律领域的局限性仍未被充分理解，需要明确AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力。

Method: 使用IRAC（问题-规则-应用-结论）模型作为分析框架，重点研究法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用规则(R)和将规则应用于案件事实(A)，并评估RAG、多智能体系统和神经符号AI等增强机制。

Result: 研究发现这些技术可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量权和透明、可论证推理的任务中仍存在重大挑战。

Conclusion: 当前AI在法律中最有效的角色是双重的：作为简单重复案件的高容量助手，以及作为复杂事务中人类专家的复杂"陪练伙伴"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

Conclusion: 动态交互式评估对于推进协作代码生成代理的发展至关重要，能够提供传统静态基准无法获得的细粒度诊断洞察。

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong

Conclusion: 该方法为教育工作者提供了深入了解学生学习旅程的丰富洞察，为更有针对性的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

Conclusion: VISION框架有效减少了虚假学习，提高了漏洞检测的鲁棒性和可解释性，为可信AI网络安全系统提供了新方法。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MoE模型在边缘设备上的内存约束问题，通过智能专家替换和缓存重用策略，在保证精度的同时显著提升效率

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索大型语言模型是否能够仅通过统计学习获得复杂的社会规范理解，挑战传统认知科学中强调具身经验必要性的理论。

Method: 通过两个研究系统评估多个AI系统预测555个日常场景中人类社会适当性判断的能力，比较AI预测与人类参与者平均判断的接近程度。

Result: GPT-4.5在连续尺度上预测集体判断的准确率超过所有人类参与者（第100百分位），其他模型如Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5和Claude Sonnet 4也分别超越98.7%、97.8%和96.0%的人类。

Conclusion: 研究证明仅通过语言数据的统计学习就能产生复杂的社会认知模型，语言作为文化知识传播的丰富储存库，但AI系统仍存在系统性相关错误，表明基于模式的社会理解存在潜在边界。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

TL;DR: 本文提出了经验驱动的终身学习(ELL)框架，包含四个核心原则：经验探索、长期记忆、技能学习和知识内化，并推出了StuLife基准数据集来模拟学生的大学生涯，用于评估终身学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向通用智能发展，需要从静态任务优化转向创建能够持续学习的开放智能体，构建能够通过真实世界交互实现持续进化的自演化智能体。

Method: 提出ELL框架，基于四个核心原则：经验探索（通过自驱动交互学习）、长期记忆（构建持久记忆系统）、技能学习（从经验中抽象可重用技能）、知识内化（将显性经验转化为直觉能力）。同时开发StuLife基准数据集，模拟学生大学生涯的三个核心阶段和十个子场景。

Result: 创建了StuLife基准数据集，为评估终身学习能力提供了全面平台，包括记忆保持、技能迁移和自驱动行为等评估维度。

Conclusion: ELL框架为构建持续学习的开放智能体提供了系统方法，StuLife基准为评估终身学习能力提供了有效工具，同时探索了上下文工程在推进AGI发展中的作用。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种大型语言模型（GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Opus 4）在边缘型人格障碍现象学定性分析中的表现，发现Gemini最接近人类分析，但总体重叠度较低，同时AI能发现人类遗漏的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在现象学定性分析中的能力，特别是针对边缘型人格障碍这种时间性和自我性障碍的一手经验分析，旨在评估AI辅助分析在减轻人类解释偏见方面的潜力。

Method: 基于24名住院患者生活故事访谈的人类主题分析，使用三种LLM模仿原始研究者的解释风格，通过盲法和非盲法专家评估语义一致性、Jaccard系数和多维效度评分（可信度、连贯性、实质性、数据基础性）。

Result: 模型与人类分析的重叠度从GPT的0%到Claude的42%和Gemini的58%，Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28）。但模型发现了人类遗漏的主题。Gemini的输出最接近人类分析，效度评分显著高于其他模型（p<0.0001），在盲法评估中被判断为人类分析。

Conclusion: AI增强的主题分析具有可变性和潜力，能够减轻人类解释偏见，所有评分与文本量和每主题词数高度相关（R>0.78），表明LLM在现象学分析中既有局限性也有补充价值。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Motivation: 传统人工标注主观性强，现有NLP方法在代数等符号领域失效，需要开发客观、领域无关的问题难度确定方法。

Method: 采用基于强化学习的多臂老虎机框架，利用逆变异系数作为风险调整指标，仅使用解题者的得分和时间数据进行难度估计。

Result: 在三个异构数据集上验证，平均R2达到0.9213，平均RMSE为0.0584，显著优于回归、NLP和IRT等基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法领域无关、自监督，能有效支持智能辅导系统的自适应评估，特别适合符号领域，符合最近发展区理论。

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Motivation: 现有任务无法评估LLM在交互式未知环境中的综合推理能力，需要新的评估方法

Method: 提出黑盒交互评估范式，构建Oracle基准测试集，包启6类型黑盒任务和96个黑盒，让LLM通过交互推断隐藏函数

Result: o3在6个任务中5个排名第一，在简单黑盒上达到70%+准确率，但在困难任务上性能降至低于40%

Conclusion: LLM缺乏高级规划能力，无法制定高效适应的探索策略来精炼假设，需要进一步改进

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Motivation: 解决传统智能体架构中长期存在的协调困难，实现更灵活、自适应和上下文相关的智能行为，实践Minsky的"心智社会"理论。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的多个模块完全异步运行，通过模块间语言介导的通信和单一共享全局状态来协调行为，将推理卸载给LLM。

Conclusion: 该方法支持Minsky的心智社会概念，为人工智能研究开辟了新途径，表明复杂认知可以从简单过程的协调交互中涌现。

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法在复杂任务上仍难以捕捉深层程序逻辑，研究发现训练数据难度存在缩放定律——过多低难度数据阻碍抽象能力，而高难度数据显著增强推理能力

Method: 提出SST框架：1)使用结构化解决方案模板链进行微调，动态加权损失优先程序逻辑；2)推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知支架；3)集成课程微调，明确教导模型自我规划-执行-自我纠正

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和新的Dynamic En基准测试中，SST显著提高了准确性和效率，特别是在更难的问题上

Conclusion: SST框架通过结构化模板和难度课程有效解决了大语言模型在程序性推理方面的局限性，为数学推理等需要结构化思维的任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical

Method: 从Natural Questions自动生成HDS-QA合成数据集，包含并行可执行和顺序依赖的子查询，并基于此微调LRM模型

Result: 在多个基准测试中超越最先进基线，在FanOutQA和BrowseComp上分别提升15.9和11.5 F1分数，显著减少搜索轮次和推理延迟

Conclusion: 显式训练LRM利用混合并行和顺序查询具有高效性、可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

Motivation: 随着学习系统对日常决策影响日益增强，用户端的算法集体行动（ACA）作为监管端政策和公司端模型设计的补充手段变得重要。传统上现实世界的集体行动是分散的、由多个目标相同但策略不同的集体组成，但现有ACA文献主要关注单一集体场景。

Method: 提出了首个多集体ACA理论框架，特别关注分类任务中的集体行动，研究多个集体如何通过植入信号（即改变特征版本与目标类别之间的关联）来偏置分类器。分析了集体规模和目标一致性的定量作用。

Result: 建立了多集体ACA的理论基础，提供了关于集体规模和目标一致性相互作用的定量结果，补充了之前的实证研究成果。

Conclusion: 该框架为多集体算法集体行动的整体处理开辟了道路，为理解分散式集体行动在影响机器学习系统方面的协同效应提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型存在两大缺陷：作为分类器不提供解释，且依赖静态数据集的监督微调限制了泛化能力。需要更好的方法来监督多步推理中间步骤的逻辑有效性

Method: 提出StepWiser生成式评判模型，通过元推理对策略模型的推理步骤进行推理，输出思考标记后再给出最终判断。使用强化学习基于rollout的相对结果进行训练

Conclusion: 将逐步奖励建模从分类任务重构为推理任务的方法是有效的，生成式评判模型能够提供更好的判断准确性和泛化能力

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究Model Context Protocol (MCP)作为统一范式，分析其连接协议级适应与上下文感知决策的能力，提出五类分类法并揭示三个关键发现，最后提出将MCP作为下一代自适应、上下文感知和智能交通基础设施基础的研究路线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联设备、自主系统和AI应用的快速扩张导致自适应交通系统严重碎片化，不同协议和上下文源相互隔离，需要统一范式来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过系统调查和分析现有文献，提出包含自适应机制、上下文感知框架、统一模型、集成策略和MCP架构的五类分类法，并进行深入分析。

Result: 发现传统交通协议已达到孤立适应的极限，MCP的客户端-服务器和JSON-RPC结构能够实现语义互操作性，AI驱动的交通需要MCP特有的集成范式。

Conclusion: MCP有潜力成为下一代自适应、上下文感知和智能交通基础设施的基础，为标准化集成框架提供自然演进路径。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

TL;DR: 一种新的热词定制系统，通过热词预检索模块(H-PRM)提升ASR中大规模热词的识别率，可集成到传统模型和音频大语言模型中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型在处理大规模热词时识别率会快速下降，需要解决热词定制的等级扩展问题

Method: 使用热词预检索模块(H-PRM)通过测量热词与语音段落的音响相似度来识别最相关的热词候选项，支持插入式集成到SeACo-Paraformer等传统模型，并通过提示工程方式集成到音频大语言模型

Result: 广泛测试验证H-PRM能够超过现有方法，显著提升热词后召回率(PRR)

Conclusion: H-PRM为ASR热词定制预示了新方向，提供了一种灵活可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of
domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in
traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing
models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops
dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we
introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword
pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by
measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment.
This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models
such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate
(PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a
prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive
testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new
direction for hotword customization in ASR.

TL;DR: SwiftF0是一种轻量级神经网络模型，在嘈杂环境下实现实时单音高音估计，性能优于现有方法，计算效率高，适合资源受限设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在嘈杂环境下、资源受限设备上进行准确实时单音高音估计的挑战，现有方法在噪声条件下性能下降严重且计算成本高。

Method: 使用多样化的语音、音乐和合成数据集进行训练，采用广泛的数据增强技术，并引入SpeechSynth合成语音数据集提供精确的真实音高曲线。

Result: 在10 dB SNR下达到91.80%的谐波平均值，比CREPE基线提高12个百分点以上，仅需95,842个参数，CPU运行速度比CREPE快约42倍。

Conclusion: SwiftF0在噪声鲁棒性、计算效率和跨领域泛化能力方面均表现出色，为实时音高估计提供了高效的解决方案，并发布了开源基准测试套件。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time monophonic pitch estimation in noisy conditions,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains an open challenge in
audio processing. We present \emph{SwiftF0}, a novel, lightweight neural model
that sets a new state-of-the-art for monophonic pitch estimation. Through
training on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data
augmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains
while maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\% harmonic
mean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12
percentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0
requires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on
CPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the
critical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which
typically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce
\emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level
TTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more
robust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric,
combining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable
pitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite. A live demo
of SwiftF0 is available at https://swift-f0.github.io/, the source code at
https://github.com/lars76/swift-f0, and the benchmark framework at

TL;DR: 多说话人微调方法相比单说话人微调，在构音障碍语音识别中能降低13.15%的词错误率，通过更广泛的特征学习和减少过拟合来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构音障碍语音识别面临严重程度变化和与正常语音差异的挑战，传统方法为每个患者单独微调模型，但存在效率低下和泛化能力不足的问题

Method: 采用多说话人微调策略，同时在多个构音障碍说话人数据上进行模型微调，而不是传统的单说话人微调

Result: 多说话人微调相比单说话人微调实现了最高13.15%的词错误率降低，提高了目标说话人的识别准确率，减少了对单个患者数据的依赖

Conclusion: 多说话人微调方法通过更广泛的病理特征学习、减轻说话人特定过拟合，显著提升了构音障碍语音识别的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition faces challenges from severity variations and
disparities relative to normal speech. Conventional approaches individually
fine-tune ASR models pre-trained on normal speech per patient to prevent
feature conflicts. Counter-intuitively, experiments reveal that multi-speaker
fine-tuning (simultaneously on multiple dysarthric speakers) improves
recognition of individual speech patterns. This strategy enhances
generalization via broader pathological feature learning, mitigates
speaker-specific overfitting, reduces per-patient data dependence, and improves
target-speaker accuracy - achieving up to 13.15% lower WER versus
single-speaker fine-tuning.

TL;DR: SegReConcat是一种数据增强方法，通过在单词级别分割匿名化语音并重新排列片段来增强说话人验证系统的去匿名化能力，在7个匿名化系统中对5个系统有效提升了去匿名化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音匿名化旨在隐藏说话人身份但保留语音数据效用，然而残留的说话人线索仍然存在隐私风险，需要增强攻击者端的去匿名化能力。

Method: 提出SegReConcat方法：在单词级别分割匿名化语音，使用随机或基于相似性的策略重新排列片段以破坏长期上下文线索，然后将片段与原始话语连接，使攻击者能从多个角度学习源说话人特征。

Result: 在VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024框架下评估了7个匿名化系统，SegReConcat在5个系统中成功提升了去匿名化效果。

Conclusion: SegReConcat是一种有效的攻击者端数据增强方法，能够显著提升对匿名化语音的去匿名化能力，揭示了当前语音匿名化系统存在的隐私漏洞。

Abstract: Anonymization of voice seeks to conceal the identity of the speaker while
maintaining the utility of speech data. However, residual speaker cues often
persist, which pose privacy risks. We propose SegReConcat, a data augmentation
method for attacker-side enhancement of automatic speaker verification systems.
SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at the word level, rearranges segments
using random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextual
cues, and concatenates them with the original utterance, allowing an attacker
to learn source speaker traits from multiple perspectives. The proposed method
has been evaluated in the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024 framework across
seven anonymization systems, SegReConcat improves de-anonymization on five out
of seven systems.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统比较六种数据筛选策略，证明了非均匀采样在离线强化学习中的重要性，其中基于模型不确定性的方法将碰撞率从16.0%降至5.5%，显著提升了自动驾驶规划的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在自动驾驶规划中面临极端数据不平衡问题，常规数据采样导致策略脆弱不安全，需要开发智能数据筛选方法来关注信息丰富的样本。

Method: 研究六种关键性加权方案（启发式、不确定性、行为式三类），在时间步和场景两个时间尺度评估，使用目标条件保守Q学习和注意力架构训练七个智能体，在Waymax模拟器中进行测试。

Result: 所有数据筛选方法均显著优于基线，基于模型不确定性的方法实现最大安全改进，碰撞率降低近三倍（16.0%→5.5%），时间步级加权擅长反应安全，场景级加权改善长期规划。

Conclusion: 智能非均匀采样是构建安全可靠自动驾驶系统的关键组件，为离线强化学习中的数据筛选提供了全面框架。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for
training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world
driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane
scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe
policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address
this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data
curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich
samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are
categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and
behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual
timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based
architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our
results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the
baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal
achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate
by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear
trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while
scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a
comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that
intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and
reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: The research and development of intelligent automation solutions is a
ground-breaking point for the factory of the future. A promising and
challenging mission is the use of autonomous robot systems to automate tasks in
the field of maintenance. For this purpose, the robot system must be able to
plan autonomously the different manipulation tasks and the corresponding paths.
Basic requirements are the development of algorithms with a low computational
complexity and the possibility to deal with environmental uncertainties. In
this work, an approach is presented, which is especially suited to solve the
problem of maintenance automation. For this purpose, offline data from CAD is
combined with online data from an RGBD vision system via a probabilistic
filter, to compensate uncertainties from offline data. For planning the
different tasks, a method is explained, which use a symbolic description,
founded on a novel sampling-based method to compute the disassembly space. For
path planning we use global state-of-the art algorithms with a method that
allows the adaption of the exploration stepsize in order to reduce the planning
time. Every method is experimentally validated and discussed.

Abstract: Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have exhibited remarkable
prowess across various cognitive tasks using extensive training data. However,
the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as
highpower consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in
SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these
issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots
by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning
enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events.
By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic
environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance.
This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using
neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights
from spatial cells such as place and grid cells. By integrating these models,
we aim to enable online associative learning for spatial tasks in real-time
scenarios, bridging the gap between biological spatial cognition and robotics

Motivation: 导航标志和地图（如平面图和街道地图）在人类环境中广泛可用，但很少被机器人系统使用。本文旨在利用这些现成的导航资源来解决机器人的定位问题

Method: 首先从输入地图中提取导航图，然后使用概率观测模型将检测到的标志中的方向和位置线索与图进行匹配，在蒙特卡洛框架内实现定位

Result: 在大型校园、购物中心和医院综合体等多样化环境中进行评估，实验结果显示SignLoc在仅观察1-2个标志后就能可靠地定位机器人

Conclusion: SignLoc证明了利用现成导航标志和公开地图进行机器人定位的可行性，为无需传感器建图的定位提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Navigation signs and maps, such as floor plans and street maps, are widely
available and serve as ubiquitous aids for way-finding in human environments.
Yet, they are rarely used by robot systems. This paper presents SignLoc, a
global localization method that leverages navigation signs to localize the
robot on publicly available maps -- specifically floor plans and OpenStreetMap
(OSM) graphs -- without prior sensor-based mapping. SignLoc first extracts a
navigation graph from the input map. It then employs a probabilistic
observation model to match directional and locational cues from the detected
signs to the graph, enabling robust topo-semantic localization within a Monte
Carlo framework. We evaluated SignLoc in diverse large-scale environments: part
of a university campus, a shopping mall, and a hospital complex. Experimental
results show that SignLoc reliably localizes the robot after observing only one
to two signs.

Abstract: We present a Sequential Mobile Manipulation Planning (SMMP) framework that
can solve long-horizon multi-step mobile manipulation tasks with coordinated
whole-body motion, even when interacting with articulated objects. By
abstracting environmental structures as kinematic models and integrating them
with the robot's kinematics, we construct an Augmented Configuration Apace
(A-Space) that unifies the previously separate task constraints for navigation
and manipulation, while accounting for the joint reachability of the robot
base, arm, and manipulated objects. This integration facilitates efficient
planning within a tri-level framework: a task planner generates symbolic action
sequences to model the evolution of A-Space, an optimization-based motion
planner computes continuous trajectories within A-Space to achieve desired
configurations for both the robot and scene elements, and an intermediate plan
refinement stage selects action goals that ensure long-horizon feasibility. Our
simulation studies first confirm that planning in A-Space achieves an 84.6\%
higher task success rate compared to baseline methods. Validation on real
robotic systems demonstrates fluid mobile manipulation involving (i) seven
types of rigid and articulated objects across 17 distinct contexts, and (ii)
long-horizon tasks of up to 14 sequential steps. Our results highlight the
significance of modeling scene kinematics into planning entities, rather than
encoding task-specific constraints, offering a scalable and generalizable
approach to complex robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has become of interest in the automotive

architecture. However, the scarcity of DT architectural guidelines poses a
challenge for engineering automotive DTs. Currently, the only DT architectural
standard is the one defined in ISO 23247. Though not developed for automotive

this work, we investigate the suitability of the ISO 23247 reference

Conclusion: DELIVER展示了模块化和可扩展的架构，为语言引导的多机器人协调提供了有效解决方案，推动了网络物理系统集成的发展。

Abstract: We present DELIVER (Directed Execution of Language-instructed Item Via
Engineered Relay), a fully integrated framework for cooperative multi-robot
pickup and delivery driven by natural language commands. DELIVER unifies
natural language understanding, spatial decomposition, relay planning, and
motion execution to enable scalable, collision-free coordination in real-world
settings. Given a spoken or written instruction, a lightweight instance of
LLaMA3 interprets the command to extract pickup and delivery locations. The
environment is partitioned using a Voronoi tessellation to define
robot-specific operating regions. Robots then compute optimal relay points
along shared boundaries and coordinate handoffs. A finite-state machine governs
each robot's behavior, enabling robust execution. We implement DELIVER on the
MultiTRAIL simulation platform and validate it in both ROS2-based Gazebo
simulations and real-world hardware using TurtleBot3 robots. Empirical results
show that DELIVER maintains consistent mission cost across varying team sizes
while reducing per-agent workload by up to 55% compared to a single-agent
system. Moreover, the number of active relay agents remains low even as team
size increases, demonstrating the system's scalability and efficient agent
utilization. These findings underscore DELIVER's modular and extensible
architecture for language-guided multi-robot coordination, advancing the
frontiers of cyber-physical system integration.

Our key insight is that the motion of keypoints on human-inspired robot
end-effectors closely mirrors the motion of corresponding human body keypoints.
This enables us to use a model trained to predict future motion on human data
\emph{zero-shot} on robot data. We train sensorimotor policies to track the
predictions of such a model, conditioned on a history of past robot states,
while optimizing a relatively sparse task reward. This approach entirely
bypasses gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses, which
limit existing methods from fully leveraging the scale and diversity of modern
human-scene interaction datasets. Empirically, we find that our approach can
work across robots and tasks, outperforming existing baselines by a large
margin. In addition, we find that tracking a human motion model can substitute
for carefully designed dense rewards and curricula in manipulation tasks. Code,

Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in
static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often
with limited sensor diversity and restricted temporal span. These conditions
fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real farmland, including illumination
changes, crop growth variation, and natural disturbances. As a result, models
trained on such data often lack robustness and generalization when applied to
real-world field scenarios. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a novel
robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture
the dynamic conditions of real-world agricultural environments. Our platform
integrates multiple sensors and enables remote, time-synchronized acquisition
of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, supporting efficient and repeatable
long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages.
We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the
AgriChrono dataset, highlighting the difficulty of reconstruction in real-world
field environments and demonstrating its value as a research asset for
advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions. The code and dataset

Result: 在ARMBench数据集上F1分数从77.9提升到80.0，测试时增强后进一步提升到81.4，无需额外计算开销

Conclusion: 时空信息对失败检测至关重要，建议未来研究进一步探索合适的启发式方法

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code

TL;DR: HyperTASR是一个基于超网络的框架，通过任务目标和执行阶段动态调制场景表征，提升机器人操作任务的策略学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人操作策略学习使用任务无关的表征提取方法，无法模拟人类认知中的动态感知适应能力，需要开发能够根据任务上下文动态调整场景表征的方法。

Method: 采用超网络架构，根据任务规范和进展状态动态生成表征变换参数，使表征在任务执行过程中能够上下文演化，同时保持与现有策略学习框架的架构兼容性。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中的综合评估显示，该方法在不同表征范式下都取得了显著的性能提升，通过消融研究和注意力可视化证实了其能够选择性地优先处理任务相关的场景信息。

Conclusion: HyperTASR框架通过建立任务上下文和状态依赖处理路径的计算分离，提高了学习效率和表征质量，更接近人类在操作任务中的自适应感知模式。

Abstract: Effective policy learning for robotic manipulation requires scene
representations that selectively capture task-relevant environmental features.
Current approaches typically employ task-agnostic representation extraction,
failing to emulate the dynamic perceptual adaptation observed in human
cognition. We present HyperTASR, a hypernetwork-driven framework that modulates
scene representations based on both task objectives and the execution phase.
Our architecture dynamically generates representation transformation parameters
conditioned on task specifications and progression state, enabling
representations to evolve contextually throughout task execution. This approach
maintains architectural compatibility with existing policy learning frameworks
while fundamentally reconfiguring how visual features are processed. Unlike
methods that simply concatenate or fuse task embeddings with task-agnostic
representations, HyperTASR establishes computational separation between
task-contextual and state-dependent processing paths, enhancing learning
efficiency and representational quality. Comprehensive evaluations in both
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate substantial performance
improvements across different representation paradigms. Through ablation
studies and attention visualization, we confirm that our approach selectively
prioritizes task-relevant scene information, closely mirroring human adaptive
perception during manipulation tasks. The project website is at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特技飞行任务难以手动设计奖励函数，且具有主观性，偏好强化学习能够从人类偏好中学习复杂目标，适用于强调运动风格质量的无人机特技动作。

Method: 在Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization基础上提出REC方法，通过奖励集成和置信度机制改进偏好建模和学习稳定性。

Result: REC方法达到88.4%的成型奖励性能，优于标准Preference PPO的55.2%。成功将仿真训练的策略迁移到真实无人机，实现多种特技动作。手动设计奖励仅与人类偏好60.7%一致。

Conclusion: 偏好强化学习能有效捕捉复杂的人类中心目标，REC方法在物理和仿真领域都表现出色，突显了PbRL在难以形式化任务中的优势。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) enables agents to learn
control policies without requiring manually designed reward functions, making
it well-suited for tasks where objectives are difficult to formalize or
inherently subjective. Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging
problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of
precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone
control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops.
Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we
propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward
learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability.
Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2%
with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully
transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers
where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a
representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight
the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement
with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in
capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated
domains.

Conclusion: AS2FM方法实用性强，支持更全面的系统特性，验证效率高，适用于真实自主机器人控制系统

Abstract: Designing robotic systems to act autonomously in unforeseen environments is a
challenging task. This work presents a novel approach to use formal
verification, specifically Statistical Model Checking (SMC), to verify system
properties of autonomous robots at design-time. We introduce an extension of
the SCXML format, designed to model system components including both Robot
Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and Behavior Tree (BT) features. Further, we
contribute Autonomous Systems to Formal Models (AS2FM), a tool to translate the
full system model into JANI. The use of JANI, a standard format for
quantitative model checking, enables verification of system properties with
off-the-shelf SMC tools. We demonstrate the practical usability of AS2FM both
in terms of applicability to real-world autonomous robotic control systems, and
in terms of verification runtime scaling. We provide a case study, where we
successfully identify problems in a ROS 2-based robotic manipulation use case
that is verifiable in less than one second using consumer hardware.
Additionally, we compare to the state of the art and demonstrate that our
method is more comprehensive in system feature support, and that the
verification runtime scales linearly with the size of the model, instead of
exponentially.

Abstract: Autonomous control of the laparoscope in robot-assisted Minimally Invasive
Surgery (MIS) has received considerable research interest due to its potential
to improve surgical safety. Despite progress in pixel-level Image-Based Visual
Servoing (IBVS) control, the requirement of continuous visibility and the
existence of complex disturbances, such as parameterization error, measurement
noise, and uncertainties of payloads, could degrade the surgeon's visual
experience and compromise procedural safety. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes VisionSafeEnhanced Visual Predictive Control (VPC), a robust and
uncertainty-adaptive framework for autonomous laparoscope control that
guarantees Field of View (FoV) safety under uncertainty. Firstly, Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) is utilized to perform hybrid (deterministic +
stochastic) quantification of operational uncertainties including residual
model uncertainties, stochastic uncertainties, and external disturbances. Based
on uncertainty quantification, a novel safety aware trajectory optimization
framework with probabilistic guarantees is proposed, where a
uncertainty-adaptive safety Control Barrier Function (CBF) condition is given
based on uncertainty propagation, and chance constraints are simultaneously
formulated based on probabilistic approximation. This uncertainty aware
formulation enables adaptive control effort allocation, minimizing unnecessary
camera motion while maintaining robustness. The proposed method is validated
through comparative simulations and experiments on a commercial surgical robot
platform (MicroPort MedBot Toumai) performing a sequential multi-target lymph
node dissection. Compared with baseline methods, the framework maintains
near-perfect target visibility (>99.9%), reduces tracking e

proposed HIL testbed includes brushless DC motors and drivers that communicate
using a CAN bus, an embedded computer that executes control and adaptation

attitude states, and responds to actions of the external actuators. We propose
methods to artificially induce failures on the reaction wheels, and present
related issues and lessons learned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机高效安全导航在作战支持、包裹投递和搜救行动等应用中至关重要，需要一种能够在静态和动态环境中进行实时路径规划的先进算法。

Method: 使用椭圆切线相交方法生成可行路径，为每个威胁生成两条子路径，基于启发式规则选择最优路线，迭代优化路径直至到达目标。结合无人机运动学和动力学约束，采用基于二次贝塞尔曲线的改进平滑技术生成平滑高效路径。

Conclusion: TIG算法是一种高效的无人机路径规划方法，在静态和动态环境中均表现出优越性能，能够快速生成平滑且最优的飞行路径，适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

Abstract: Achieving both behavioral similarity and appropriateness in human-like motion
generation for humanoid robot remains an open challenge, further compounded by
the lack of cross-embodiment adaptability. To address this problem, we propose
HuBE, a bi-level closed-loop framework that integrates robot state, goal poses,
and contextual situations to generate human-like behaviors, ensuring both
behavioral similarity and appropriateness, and eliminating structural
mismatches between motion generation and execution. To support this framework,
we construct HPose, a context-enriched dataset featuring fine-grained
situational annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a bone scaling-based data
augmentation strategy that ensures millimeter-level compatibility across
heterogeneous humanoid robots. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple commercial
platforms demonstrate that HuBE significantly improves motion similarity,
behavioral appropriateness, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art
baselines, establishing a solid foundation for transferable and human-like
behavior execution across diverse humanoid robots.

Motivation: 现有方法直接使用LLM从自然语言任务生成可执行程序，但由于LLM的不稳定性和任务复杂性，导致生成的代码出现大量编程错误，特别是当使用轻量级LLM时效果更差。

Method: 提出Robot Skill Language (RSL)来抽象控制程序的复杂细节，构建RSL编译器和调试器验证LLM生成的RSL程序，并通过错误反馈细调LLM输出，直到程序通过编译器验证。

Result: 实验表明NRTrans在多种LLM和任务下都超过现有方法，并为轻量级LLM实现了高成功率。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在程序执行前提供正确性保证，显著提升了LLM驱动的机器人应用效果。

Abstract: The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics
to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied
intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt
design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user
tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and
the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to
tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly
undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.
This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)
provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)
enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based
fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is
proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,
bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the
RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by
the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until
being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the
LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,
significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.
Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range
of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the
ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for
generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting
robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and
safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging
visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a

not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated
with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of
advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled
indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our
method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art

Abstract: Purposeful behavior in robotic assistants requires the integration of

to recognizing explicit prompts, which limits autonomy, or is oversimplified
through assumptions such as near-perfect information. We argue that a critical
gap remains unaddressed -- specifically, the challenge of reasoning about the
uncertain outcomes and perception errors inherent to human intention
recognition. In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient to

combination of planners. Centered around an intention-recognition POMDP, our
approach addresses cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty. Our
integrated framework has been successfully tested on a physical robot with
promising results.

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为稳健的视觉引导运动提供了简单、有效且可解释的替代方案

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 方向信息的高效共享使DIT*能够实现目标偏向探索，显著提高了路径规划的性能和效率

Abstract: Optimal path planning requires finding a series of feasible states from the
starting point to the goal to optimize objectives. Popular path planning
algorithms, such as Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), employ effort heuristics to
guide the search. Effective heuristics are accurate and computationally
efficient, but achieving both can be challenging due to their conflicting
nature. This paper proposes Direction Informed Trees (DIT*), a sampling-based
planner that focuses on optimizing the search direction for each edge,
resulting in goal bias during exploration. We define edges as generalized
vectors and integrate similarity indexes to establish a directional filter that
selects the nearest neighbors and estimates direction costs. The estimated
direction cost heuristics are utilized in edge evaluation. This strategy allows
the exploration to share directional information efficiently. DIT* convergence
faster than existing single-query, sampling-based planners on tested problems
in R^4 to R^16 and has been demonstrated in real-world environments with
various planning tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is

*Luca Grillotti,Lisa Coiffard,Oscar Pang,Maxence Faldor,Antoine Cully*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: URSA是一种无监督真实世界技能获取方法，扩展了QDAC算法，使机器人能够在真实环境中自主发现和掌握多样化的高性能技能，无需人工定义技能空间或精心调整启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如QDAC需要手动定义技能空间和精心调整启发式方法，限制了在真实世界的适用性。自主技能发现在物理硬件上直接学习面临安全和数据效率的挑战。

Method: URSA是QDAC的扩展，支持启发式驱动的技能发现和完全无监督设置。该方法在Unitree A1四足机器人上实现了多样化的运动技能发现。

Result: URSA在仿真和真实世界中成功发现了多样化的运动技能，在9个仿真损坏场景中的5个和5个真实世界损坏场景中的3个中优于所有基线方法。学习到的技能库可重用于下游任务如损坏适应。

Conclusion: URSA建立了一个新的真实世界机器人学习框架，能够在有限人工干预下实现持续技能发现，代表了向更自主和适应性更强的机器人系统迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors
without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical
hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints.
Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require
manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting
real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition
(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and
master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We
demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a
Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream
tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all
baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.
Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that
enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,
representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic
systems. Demonstration videos are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型检查的实时多步规划方法，用于自主机器人的障碍物避让，在低功耗设备上无需预计算数据即可实现实时规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物智能中核心知识和注意力机制的启发，旨在为自主机器人开发安全、可靠且可解释的实时多步规划系统，超越传统反应式智能体的单步规划限制

Method: 采用专门的模型检查算法，通过前向深度优先搜索进行多步规划；使用对局部环境有界变化敏感的2D LiDAR数据离散化方法；通过链式临时控制系统来抵消环境扰动

Result: 在死胡同和游乐场场景中验证了方法的有效性，经验结果和理论证明表明该方法能够为局部障碍物避让生成高效的多步计划，性能优于只能单步规划的反应式智能体

Conclusion: 该研究为自主车辆领域开发安全、可靠和可解释的规划系统提供了指导性案例研究，证明了模型检查在实时多步规划中的实用价值

Abstract: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time
multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have
developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans
in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.
This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered
device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are
spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an
autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel
discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local
environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward
depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both
empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our
approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient
multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of
a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional
case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in
the context of autonomous vehicles.

TL;DR: AutoRing是一个模仿学习框架，通过动态RCM校准和RCM-ACT架构实现眼内异物环的自主操作，无需深度传感即可完成抓取和定位任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼内异物移除需要在有限眼内空间实现毫米级精度，现有机器人系统主要依赖手动遥操作且学习曲线陡峭，存在运动缩放变化和远程运动中心点变化带来的运动学不确定性挑战。

Method: 提出AutoRing模仿学习框架，整合动态RCM校准解决坐标系不一致问题，引入结合动作分块变换器和实时运动学校准的RCM-ACT架构，仅使用立体视觉数据和专家演示的运动学信息进行训练。

Result: 在未校准显微镜条件下成功实现端到端自主操作，完成环抓取和定位任务，无需显式深度传感。

Conclusion: 为开发能够执行复杂眼内手术的智能眼外科系统提供了可行框架。

Abstract: Intraocular foreign body removal demands millimeter-level precision in
confined intraocular spaces, yet existing robotic systems predominantly rely on
manual teleoperation with steep learning curves. To address the challenges of
autonomous manipulation (particularly kinematic uncertainties from variable
motion scaling and variation of the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) point), we
propose AutoRing, an imitation learning framework for autonomous intraocular
foreign body ring manipulation. Our approach integrates dynamic RCM calibration
to resolve coordinate-system inconsistencies caused by intraocular instrument
variation and introduces the RCM-ACT architecture, which combines
action-chunking transformers with real-time kinematic realignment. Trained
solely on stereo visual data and instrument kinematics from expert
demonstrations in a biomimetic eye model, AutoRing successfully completes ring
grasping and positioning tasks without explicit depth sensing. Experimental
validation demonstrates end-to-end autonomy under uncalibrated microscopy
conditions. The results provide a viable framework for developing intelligent
eye-surgical systems capable of complex intraocular procedures.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving
deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently
expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically
generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which
regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task
performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex
interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task
requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region
model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning
query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage
process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before
directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,
our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task
performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path
towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally
efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.

TL;DR: MemoryVLA是一个受人类记忆机制启发的机器人操作框架，通过工作记忆和长期记忆系统处理时序上下文，在长时程任务中显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流VLA模型忽视时序上下文，难以处理长时程、时序依赖的任务。受人类工作记忆和海马体系统启发，需要开发能够有效利用历史信息的机器人操作框架

Method: 提出Cognition-Memory-Action框架：预训练VLM编码观测为感知和认知token形成工作记忆，感知-认知记忆库存储低层细节和高层语义，工作记忆从库中检索相关信息并与当前token融合，记忆条件扩散动作专家生成时序感知动作序列

Result: 在三个仿真测试套件上分别达到71.9%、72.7%和96.5%的成功率，均优于CogACT和pi-0等基线方法，在Bridge任务上提升14.6%。在12个真实世界任务上达到84.0%成功率，长时程任务相比基线提升26%

Conclusion: MemoryVLA通过模拟人类记忆机制有效解决了机器人操作中的时序上下文问题，在仿真和真实环境中都表现出色，为长时程任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仿射编队控制通常使用普遍刚性框架来保证应力矩阵存在，但这种方法需要预定义刚性图，限制了网络设计的灵活性。需要一种能够自动设计应力矩阵并优化网络结构的方法

Method: 采用凸优化框架来设计应力矩阵，不预先定义刚性图结构，通过优化算法寻找具有较少通信链路但保持快速收敛的网络配置

Conclusion: 该凸优化框架为仿射编队控制提供了一种有效的网络设计方法，能够在减少通信复杂度的同时保持系统性能，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Affine formation control (AFC) is a distributed networked control system that
has recently received increasing attention in various applications. AFC is
typically achieved using a generalized consensus system where the stress
matrix, which encodes the graph structure, is used instead of a graph
Laplacian. Universally rigid frameworks (URFs) guarantee the existence of the
stress matrix and have thus become the guideline for such a network design. In
this work, we propose a convex optimization framework to design the stress
matrix for AFC without predefining a rigid graph. We aim to find a resulting
network with a reduced number of communication links, but still with a fast
convergence speed. We show through simulations that our proposed solutions can
yield a more sparse graph, while admitting a faster convergence compared to the
state-of-the-art solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感知系统无法检测主动分配网络中的不可观测事故，特别是在包含反变器基资源的网络中，需要一种能够识别物理事故和传感器故障的方法

Method: 建立随机混合系统(SHS)模型，结合传统和反变器基资源，形成随机切换系统。利用高频采样的多变量时间序列数据，训练时间序列学习模型进行实时事故检测和分类

Conclusion: 该机器学习基于SHS的框架能够有效地检测主动分配网络中的不可观测事故，为包含反变器基资源的现代电力系统提供了可靠的事故检测方案

Abstract: This paper presents a machine-learning based Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS)
modeling framework to detect contingencies in active distribution networks
populated with inverter-based resources (IBRs). In particular, this framework
allows detecting unobservable contingencies, which cannot be identified by
normal sensing systems. First, a state-space SHS model combining conventional
and IRB-based resources is introduced to formulate the dynamic interaction
between continuous states of distribution networks and discrete contingency
events. This model forms a randomly switching system, where parameters or
network topology can change due to contingencies. We consider two contingency
classes: (i) physical events, such as line outages, and (ii) measurement
anomalies caused by sensor faults. Leveraging multivariate time series data
derived from high-frequency sampling of system states and network outputs, a
time series-based learning model is trained for real-time contingency detection
and classification. Simulation studies, carried out on the IEEE 33-bus
distribution system, demonstrate a 96% overall detection accuracy.

Conclusion: 该算法成功解决了电磁编队飞行中的约束控制问题，为实际应用提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: This article presents a feedback control algorithm for electromagnetic
formation flying with constraints on the satellites' states and control inputs.
The algorithm combines several key techniques. First, we use alternating
magnetic field forces to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair
of satellites in the formation. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation
system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes
are controlled in order to prescribe the time-averaged force between each pair
of satellites. Next, the desired time-averaged force is computed from a optimal
control that satisfies state constraints (i.e., no collisions and an upper
limit on intersatellite speeds) and input constraints (i.e., not exceeding
satellite's apparent power capability). The optimal time-averaged force is
computed using a single relaxed control barrier function that is obtained by
composing multiple control barrier functions that are designed to enforce each
state and input constraint. Finally, we demonstrate the satellite formation
control method in numerical simulations.

Method: 设计了公平性感知的多气荷强化学习框架，通过LLM评估器计算三种公平性指标（FTG、FBS、FPP），并将其组合到奖励函数中，在连续双向筹件下进行部分可观测份交易。

Result: 在从小规模到大规模社区及实际数据集的实验中，框架推动了本地P2P交易，降低了消费者成本，维持了参与者间的公平性，同时保障了公用事业的可持续性。

Conclusion: 该框架在太阳能可用性和总需求变化情况下都表现出稳健性能，为实现经济高效、社会公平且技术可靠的去中心化电力市场提供了可扩展的LLM导向解决方案。

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution
systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet
most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or
private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes
under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent
reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large
language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double
auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After
each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid
(FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are
integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that
fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The
environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard
constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability.
Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated
community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges
toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only
procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves
utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate
demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided
pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient,
socially equitable, and technically sound.

*Alessio Moreschini,Wei He,Romeo Ortega,Yiheng Lu,Tao Li*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文针对PID-PBC在离散化应用中面临的两个关键问题：PID离散化后无源性丧失和系统输出无源性不保持，提出了基于隐式中点法的离散化方案，确保功率变换器模型的全局稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PID-PBC虽然在连续时间下具有全局稳定性，但在实际离散化应用中面临两个主要障碍：PID离散化后无源性丧失，以及系统输出无源性在离散化后不保持，这限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用隐式中点离散化方法（一种保辛积分技术），提出能保持无源性的PID离散化方案，并为离散化系统构造新的无源输出，建立增量模型的无源性（移位无源性）。

Result: 证明了离散时间PID-PBC定义了增量模型的被动映射，建立了离散化功率变换器模型的移位无源性，从而保证了功率变换器与离散化PID-PBC反馈互联的全局稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过仿真和实验验证了所提离散化方案的性能，成功解决了PID-PBC在实际离散化应用中的无源性保持问题，为功率变换器控制提供了安全可靠的理论基础。

Abstract: The key idea behind PID Passivity-based Control (PID-PBC) is to leverage the
passivity property of PIDs (for all positive gains) and wrap the PID controller
around a passive output to ensure global stability in closed-loop. However, the
practical applicability of PID-PBC is stymied by two key facts: (i) the vast
majority of practical implementations of PIDs is carried-out in discrete time
-- discretizing the continuous time dynamical system of the PID; (ii) the
well-known problem that passivity is not preserved upon discretization, even
with small sampling times. Therefore, two aspects of the PID-PBC must be
revisited for its safe practical application. First, we propose a
discretization of the PID that ensures its passivity. Second, since the output
that is identified as passive for the continuous time system is not necessarily
passive for its discrete time version, we construct a new output that ensures
the passivity property for the discretization of the system. In this paper, we
provide a constructive answer to both issues for the case of power converter
models. Instrumental to achieve this objective is the use of the implicit
midpoint discretization method -- which is a symplectic integration technique
that preserves system invariants. Since the reference value for the output to
be regulated in power converters is non-zero, we are henceforth interested in
the property of passivity of the incremental model -- currently known as
shifted passivity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the resulting discrete-time
PID-PBC defines a passive map for the incremental model and establish shifted
passivity for the discretized power converter model. Combining these
properties, we prove global stability for the feedback interconnection of the
power converter with the discretized PID-PBC. The paper also presents
simulations and experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed
discretization.

Abstract: In many applications, system identification experiments must be performed
under output feedback to ensure safety or to maintain system operation. In this
paper, we consider the online design of informative experiments for ARMAX
models by applying a bounded perturbation to the input signal generated by a

resulting output perturbation within user-specified limits and can be
efficiently computed in closed form. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method in two numerical experiments.

Motivation: 为了解决水下通信的可靠性问题，构建具有弹性的水下通信骨干网络，克服传统水下通信系统的局限性。

Method: 集成UOAPs与PON光纤回程，采用直接链路和O-RIS辅助链路的硬切换机制，评估主动和被动O-RIS配置，应用SC和MRC分集合并方案。

Result: 最优O-RIS布局显著提升系统性能，但线性区域中过近放置会导致性能下降。增加O-RIS元件数量在实用范围内可进一步提升整体性能和对水下信道变化的适应性。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合UWOC系统通过智能O-RIS部署和分集技术，能够有效提升水下通信的可靠性和适应性，为水下通信网络提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: This Letter presents a novel hybrid underwater wireless optical communication
(UWOC) system that integrates underwater optical access points (UOAPs) with a
passive optical network (PON)-based fiber-optic backhaul to provide a resilient
backbone. A hard switching mechanism is employed between direct and optical
reconfigurable intelligent surface (O-RIS)-assisted links to ensure reliable
connectivity. Unlike previous studies, the proposed system is evaluated under
both active and multiple passive O-RIS configurations. To enhance reliability,
the Selection Combining (SC) and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) schemes are
applied. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that optimal O-RIS
placement significantly enhances system performance. However, in the linear
regime, placing it too close to the receiver causes degradation due to
increased path loss and beam jitter in an identical water type. Moreover,
increasing the number of O-RIS elements within practical limits further
improves overall system performance and enhances adaptability to variations in
the underwater channel.

Motivation: 现有AC最优潮流数据集质量改进方法在大规模电力系统中缺乏可扩展性，且缺乏广泛接受的数据集质量量化指标来进行方法比较。

Method: 采用简单启发式方法，在总负载有功功率上均匀采样，使用带负载松弛变量的AC-OPF公式提高收敛性；建立基于三个指标的多标准质量评估框架：AC-OPF原始变量边际分布变异性、约束激活模式多样性和变量边界激活频率。

Result: 通过比较四种开源方法，本文提出的启发式方法在均匀随机采样（无论是独立采样还是约束到凸多面体）方面表现一致更优，在数据集质量和可扩展性之间的平衡方面得分最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了AC最优潮流数据集质量改进的可扩展性问题，并提供了可靠的质量评估框架，为机器学习模型提供了更高质量的训练数据。

Abstract: Several methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the quality
of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) datasets used in machine learning (ML)
models. Yet, scalability to large power systems remains unaddressed and
comparing generation approaches is still hindered by the absence of widely
accepted metrics quantifying AC-OPF dataset quality. In this work, we tackle
both these limitations. We provide a simple heuristic that samples load
setpoints uniformly in total load active power, rather than maximizing volume
coverage, and solves an AC-OPF formulation with load slack variables to improve
convergence. For quality assessment, we formulate a multi-criteria framework
based on three metrics, measuring variability in the marginal distributions of
AC-OPF primal variables, diversity in constraint activation patterns among
AC-OPF instances and activation frequency of variable bounds. By comparing four
open-source methods based on these metrics, we show that our heuristic
consistently outperforms uniform random sampling, whether independent or
constrained to a convex polytope, scoring as best in terms of balance between
dataset quality and scalability.

Result: 在2869节点欧洲高压输电系统上，计算时间减少高达94%，迭代次数减少85.5%，同时保持解的准确性和可行性

Conclusion: L-IPM在计算效率和鲁棒性方面均优于传统内点法，通过利用早期迭代信息并绕过后期病态计算步骤实现显著性能提升

Abstract: This paper proposes a feasibility-guaranteed learning interior point method
(L-IPM) to solve both AC and DC optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Given the
criticality of OPF, the proposed L-IPM uses a hybrid learning model approach
rather than relying solely on a simple black-box prediction. The traditional
IPM follows a central path from an initial point to the optimal solution.
However, each iteration involves solving large linear systems, which becomes
increasingly expensive as the matrices grow more ill-conditioned in later
steps. To address this, we model the IPM trajectory as a time series and train
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to project the IPM central path using
only the first few stable iterations, which carry the most informative features
about the path to optimality. We introduce a grid-informed methodology that
enforces operational constraints on generation, voltage magnitudes, and line
flows to ensure feasibility. The grid-informed LSTM serves as a tool for the
IPM central path projection and, followed by a final IPM refinement step,
significantly reduces the total number of iterations and time required for
convergence. We use a sampling method to generate a wide range of load
scenarios to improve generalization across diverse operating conditions,
efficiently covering the power system's operational space. Simulation results
on a 2869-bus European high-voltage transmission system show that the proposed
L-IPM significantly reduces solution time by up to 94\%, while maintaining
accuracy and feasibility of the solution. By leveraging early iterations and
bypassing the final ill-conditioned and computationally demanding steps of
traditional IPM, the proposed L-IPM reduces the number of required iterations
by up to 85.5\%. Since solution feasibility is also guaranteed, L-IPM
outperforms the conventional IPM in both computational efficiency and
robustness.

Abstract: Measurements and state estimates are often imperfect in control practice,
posing challenges for safety-critical applications, where safety guarantees
rely on accurate state information. In the presence of estimation errors,
several prior robust control barrier function (R-CBF) formulations have imposed
strict conditions on the input. These methods can be overly conservative and
can introduce issues such as infeasibility, high control effort, etc. This work
proposes a systematic method to improve R-CBFs, and demonstrates its advantages
on a tracked vehicle that navigates among multiple obstacles. A primary
contribution is a new optimization-based online parameter adaptation scheme
that reduces the conservativeness of existing R-CBFs. In order to reduce the
complexity of the parameter optimization, we merge several safety constraints
into one unified numerical CBF via Poisson's equation. We further address the
dual relative degree issue that typically causes difficulty in vehicle
tracking. Experimental trials demonstrate the overall performance improvement
of our approach over existing formulations.
