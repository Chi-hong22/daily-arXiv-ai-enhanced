TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成式人工智能的解决方案，用于自动化SNAM能源基础设施的工厂结构获取，通过OCR、视觉LLM、目标检测、关系推理和优化算法等技术，从工厂P&ID图纸中提取结构化设计数据和层次化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源转型需要数字化和创新技术支持，本文旨在设计基于人工智能的解决方案，自动化工厂数字化过程中的信息提取，简化MGM用户的日常工作。

Method: 采用OCR、视觉LLM、目标检测、关系推理和优化算法，并扩展了最先进的场景图生成模型，引入全新的Transformer架构来深入分析工厂组件间的复杂关系。

Result: 在设计数据文本信息提取方面达到91%的准确率；在工厂拓扑方面，93%的组件被正确识别，层次结构提取准确率约为80%。

Conclusion: 基于人工智能技术的协同使用成功克服了数据多样性带来的挑战，缺乏标准化的问题得到有效解决，为能源基础设施的数字化提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [2] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统性的评估方法来分析和量化基于修复的说话人脸生成中的唇部泄漏问题，包括三种互补的测试设置和衍生指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在保持视频细节的同时修改唇部运动，但会引入唇部泄漏问题，即生成的唇部受到参考图像影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，而标准指标难以检测这种泄漏。

Method: 采用三种互补测试设置：静音输入生成、不匹配的音频-视频配对和匹配的音频-视频合成，并引入唇部同步差异和基于静音音频的唇部同步分数等衍生指标。

Result: 该方法能够有效分析和量化唇部泄漏问题，并研究了不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响，为参考设计提供见解。

Conclusion: 提出的方法具有模型无关性，为说话人脸生成领域的未来研究建立了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

### [3] [Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Belief-Intent Co-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540)
*Shiyao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文挑战了端到端自动驾驶需要详尽场景建模的传统假设，提出基于信念-意图协同进化的认知规划方法，在nuPlan基准测试中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学启发，作者认为有效规划不需要重建完整世界模型，而是通过语义丰富的稀疏令牌中信念与意图的协同进化来实现。

Method: 提出基于信念-意图令牌协同进化的认知规划方法，使用稀疏意图令牌进行轨迹解码，并探索预测未来令牌对性能的影响。

Result: 在nuPlan基准测试中：仅使用稀疏意图令牌达到0.487m ADE；结合预测未来令牌后ADE降至0.382m，提升21.6%；显式重建损失会降低性能。

Conclusion: 智能不在于像素级保真度，而在于信念与意图的令牌化二元性。通过将规划重新定义为理解而非反应，TIWM弥合了世界模型与VLA系统之间的差距。

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Inspired by cognitive science, we propose that effective planning arises not from reconstructing the world, but from the co-evolution of belief and intent within a minimal set of semantically rich tokens. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, 11k+ samples) reveal three principles: (1) sparse intent tokens alone achieve 0.487 m ADE, demonstrating strong performance without future prediction; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.382 m, a 21.6% improvement, showing that performance emerges from cognitive planning; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss degrades performance, confirming that task-driven belief-intent co-evolution suffices under reliable perception inputs. Crucially, we observe the emergence of cognitive consistency: through prolonged training, the model spontaneously develops stable token dynamics that balance current perception (belief) and future goals (intent). This process, accompanied by "temporal fuzziness," enables robustness under uncertainty and continuous self-optimization. Our work establishes a new paradigm: intelligence lies not in pixel fidelity, but in the tokenized duality of belief and intent. By reframing planning as understanding rather than reaction, TIWM bridges the gap between world models and VLA systems, paving the way for foresightful agents that plan through imagination. Note: Numerical comparisons with methods reporting results on nuScenes are indicative only, as nuPlan presents a more challenging planning-focused evaluation.

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个多无人机监控数据集和深度学习框架，用于复杂环境下的行人跟踪，解决了动态相机位置和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理动态相机位置和复杂遮挡，需要更全面的数据集和框架来提升多无人机监控系统的性能。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8个无人机同步视频）和新框架，包括实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准、多视图特征融合的BEV表示。

Result: 在复杂环境下保持约90%的检测和跟踪准确率，成功跟踪约80%的轨迹，迁移学习表现优异，相机失效时性能优雅下降。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视图监控系统提供了重要基准，展示了在实际部署中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

### [5] [OUGS: Active View Selection via Object-aware Uncertainty Estimation in 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09397)
*Haiyi Li,Qi Chen,Denis Kalkofen,Hsiang-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OUGS是一个针对3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的主动重建框架，通过从3D高斯基元的物理参数推导不确定性，并结合语义分割掩码实现对象感知的视图选择，显著提高了目标对象的重建效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动重建方法依赖场景级不确定性度量，这些度量常受无关背景干扰，导致对象中心任务的视图选择效率低下。需要一种更原则性的方法来针对特定对象进行高效重建。

Method: 通过传播3D高斯基元物理参数的协方差，结合渲染雅可比矩阵建立可解释的不确定性模型，然后集成语义分割掩码生成对象感知的不确定性评分，实现有针对性的主动视图选择。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了3DGS重建过程的效率，相比现有最先进方法，目标对象的重建质量更高，同时还能作为全局场景的鲁棒不确定性估计器。

Conclusion: OUGS框架通过物理基础的不确定性建模和对象感知的视图选择，有效解决了复杂场景中特定对象的高效高保真重建问题，为3DGS重建提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

### [6] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的持续异常检测框架，使用统一内存库而非任务特定的内存分区，通过最近邻匹配机制实现最先进的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别的子内存库，限制了灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 所有任务共享统一内存库，在固定大小的核心集中增量更新嵌入，使用最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上分别达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC分数，在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高检测精度的同时解决了现有方法的内存碎片化问题，具有更好的灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

### [7] [Predict and Resist: Long-Term Accident Anticipation under Sensor Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08640)
*Xingcheng Liu,Bin Rao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Haicheng Liao,Jiaxun Zhang,Chengyu Lin,Meixin Zhu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，结合扩散去噪和时间感知的actor-critic模型，用于自动驾驶中的事故预测，解决传感器噪声和及时可靠预测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事故预测对于主动安全的自动驾驶至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：传感器输入噪声/退化，以及需要平衡及时预警与误报抑制的可靠预测。

Method: 集成扩散去噪模块（通过迭代细化重建抗噪声特征）和时间感知的actor-critic架构（利用长期时序推理和时间加权奖励确定最佳预警时机）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（DAD、CCD、A3D）上实现最先进精度，显著提高平均事故时间，在高斯和脉冲噪声下保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定且与人类对齐的预测，具有实际安全关键部署的潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [8] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net)，一个模块化框架，通过空间交互和长程时间上下文来评估对象对的上下文重要性，以改进动态场景图生成中的关系预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景图生成方法仅在有标注的对象对上训练，缺乏对非相关对象对的指导，导致在推理时难以识别有意义的关系。

Method: RS-Net包含空间上下文编码器（带可学习上下文标记）和时间编码器（聚合视频级信息），通过统一的三元组评分机制整合关系分数。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上的实验显示，RS-Net在各种基线方法上持续提升Recall和Precision，在mean Recall上表现尤为突出，有效处理关系的长尾分布问题。

Conclusion: RS-Net可以轻松集成到现有DSGG模型中而不改变架构，尽管参数增加但仍保持竞争力效率，性能优于最先进方法。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名适配器模块从视频特征中移除私人信息，同时保持任务实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型提取的时空特征在共享或存储时会无意中泄露敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装），现有像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型且不适用于视频基础模型。

Method: 引入轻量级匿名适配器模块（AAM），采用三种新设计的训练目标：剪辑级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失，可在冻结的视频编码器上即插即用。

Result: 在多种下游任务中显著减少35%的隐私泄露，同时保持接近基线的实用性性能，并能有效减轻动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种高效、通用的隐私保护解决方案，在保护隐私的同时保持了模型的实用性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

*Xinchen Yan,Chen Liang,Lijun Yu,Adams Wei Yu,Yifeng Lu,Quoc V. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的扩展特性，发现在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优扩展策略存在差异，生成任务需要数据量比分类任务快3-5倍增长。随着分辨率提高，模型规模需比数据量更快增长，计算能力而非训练数据量是主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的扩展特性，了解不同视觉任务的最优扩展策略。

Method: 在32x32分辨率下训练一系列Transformer模型，使用IsoFlops配置文件，计算预算最高达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量（Fr'echet距离）。

Result: 1）最优扩展策略高度依赖任务类型；2）生成任务最优设置需要数据量比分类任务快3-5倍增长；3）分辨率提高时模型规模需比数据量更快增长；4）计算能力是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。

Conclusion: 基于计算能力每年增长4-5倍的预测，未来5年内逐像素图像建模将成为可能，计算能力是推动这一发展的关键因素。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究使用扩散模型微调技术（如LoRA和DreamBooth）生成平衡的训练数据来解决图像分类中的群体偏见问题，通过聚类和多个DreamBooth模型来更好地保持原始数据分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统因训练数据中群体代表性不均而存在偏见，例如人脸数据集中金发与女性的过度关联会强化刻板印象。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据但难以保持原始分布。

Method: 探索多种扩散微调技术（LoRA、DreamBooth），通过聚类每个群体内的图像并为每个聚类训练DreamBooth模型，防止单个模型被组内变异淹没。使用这些模型生成群体平衡数据进行预训练，然后在真实数据上微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，在数据集偏见严重程度增加时，结果可与最先进的去偏技术（如Group-DRO）相媲美甚至超越。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能有效生成平衡的训练数据，缓解图像分类中的群体偏见问题，特别是在偏见严重的数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

Method: 1. 提出阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致的参考点(阴影)，将局部RI描述符与全局姿态信息结合；2. 设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，将SiPF集成到特征聚合过程中；3. 基于Bingham分布设计任务自适应的阴影定位模块，动态学习最优全局旋转。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有RI方法，特别是在需要细粒度空间区分能力的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过结合局部旋转不变特征和全局姿态信息，有效解决了对称组件区分问题，在保持旋转不变性的同时提升了模型的空间区分能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于EfficientNet架构的四步深度学习方法来分类胶质母细胞瘤的6个组织病理学区域，在BraTS-Path 2024挑战数据集上进行了评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤预后极差，需要自动、稳健且准确的病理区域识别方法来大规模理解该疾病的形态学特征。

Method: 使用EfficientNet架构（B0-B4变体）的四步深度学习分类方法，在BraTS-Path 2024数据集上训练和评估。

Result: 在训练集5折交叉验证中，EfficientNet-B1和B4达到0.98的F1分数；但在验证集和测试集上分别降至0.546和0.517，显示模型泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 开发能够良好泛化到新数据的模型对于临床应用至关重要，当前模型在训练集和测试集性能差异显著，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种非对称跨模态知识蒸馏（ACKD）方法SemBridge，用于处理语义一致性较弱的多模态数据，通过学生友好匹配和语义感知知识对齐模块，在遥感场景分类任务上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中配对模态数据有限，对称跨模态知识蒸馏（SCKD）应用受限，需要研究在弱语义一致性下的知识蒸馏方法。

Method: 提出SemBridge框架，包含学生友好匹配模块（利用自监督学习获取语义知识并动态选择相关教师样本）和语义感知知识对齐模块（使用拉格朗日优化寻找最优传输路径）。

Result: 在6种不同模型架构和多个数据集上，与7种现有方法相比取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ACKD方法能够有效处理弱语义一致性的跨模态知识蒸馏问题，SemBridge框架在遥感场景分类等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合视觉预测和LLM结构先验的半监督文档布局理解框架，通过概率加权改进伪标签生成，在轻量级和预训练架构上均取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档布局理解仍然需要大量标注数据，尽管半监督学习有所进展。现有方法未能充分利用文本预训练LLM提供的结构先验知识。

Method: 使用OCR-LLM管道推断文档层次区域，通过逆方差融合将教师检测器输出与LLM结构先验结合，生成精炼的伪标签。采用实例自适应门控机制改进固定权重。

Result: 在PubLayNet数据集上，轻量级SwiftFormer仅用5%标签达到88.2±0.3 AP；与LayoutLMv3结合达到89.7±0.4 AP，超越标准半监督学习。LLM在18.7%情况下提供语义消歧，带来+3.8 AP增益。

Conclusion: LLM结构先验与轻量级和预训练架构具有互补性，实例自适应门控优于固定权重，开源LLM可实现隐私保护部署，系统成本可控。

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN目标检测的形状依赖性问题，特别是在训练数据未包含的姿态下性能下降的问题，实现形状无关的实时人员检测。

Method: 基于服装光谱反射特性的光谱检测方法，在无GPU的资源受限边缘设备上实现轻量级系统。

Result: 处理速度达到23.2 fps（253x190像素），在模拟搜救场景中平均精度达到93.5%，远超CNN模型的最佳53.8%，误报率极低。

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam不是替代CNN检测器，而是在特定条件下（如形状不可预测的灾难救援环境）的补充工具，光谱检测在边缘设备实时运行中具有可行性。

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Conclusion: NES方法有效解决了零样本图像描述中的幻觉问题，通过负实体抑制机制显著提升了跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

TL;DR: SPEED-Q是一个针对视觉语言模型(VLMs)的低比特权重量化框架，专门解决边缘设备部署中的量化敏感性和训练稳定性问题，在2位和4位量化设置下显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 边缘设备部署视觉语言模型需要低延迟和隐私保护，但由于资源限制，需要量化技术来改善内存效率和带宽需求。现有研究很少探索对1B到2B参数VLMs的激进量化。

Method: 提出SPEED-Q框架，包含分阶段敏感度自适应机制来协调不同模态的性能，以及蒸馏增强量化策略来稳定训练过程并减少数据依赖。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPEED-Q在2位设置下比现有量化方法准确率提高6倍，在2位和4位设置下均优于先前的设备端VLM。

Conclusion: SPEED-Q是首个专门为小规模十亿参数VLM低比特量化设计的框架，能够实现准确、稳定且数据高效的复杂VLM量化。

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人机协同压缩方法主要基于人类视觉压缩流程，在整合机器视觉压缩时存在复杂度和比特率不足的问题。机器视觉仅关注图像/视频的核心区域，所需信息远少于人类视觉压缩信息。

Method: 提出基于机器视觉导向压缩的Diff-FCHM方法，采用即插即用的可变比特率策略，渐进聚合机器视觉压缩的语义信息，同时无缝利用扩散先验恢复人类视觉的高保真细节。

Result: 实验结果表明，Diff-FCHM在机器视觉和人类视觉压缩方面均取得了一致优越的性能，具有显著的优势。

Conclusion: 该研究首次成功实现了基于机器视觉导向压缩的人机协同压缩方法，为同时服务于人类感知和机器智能的图像/视频数据压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了分层蒸馏（HD）框架，将轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏从独立范式转变为协同组件，通过轨迹蒸馏建立结构"草图"，为后续基于分布的细化阶段提供近最优初始化，并引入自适应加权判别器（AWD）来提升质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的推理延迟是其实时应用的关键障碍。现有的轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏方法存在根本性权衡：轨迹方法保留全局结构但牺牲高频细节，分布方法可实现更高保真度但常出现模式崩溃和训练不稳定。

Method: 1. 分层蒸馏框架：轨迹蒸馏作为结构"草图"，为分布蒸馏提供近最优初始化；2. 引入自适应加权判别器（AWD），通过动态分配token权重专注于局部缺陷，实现高效细节细化。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，单步模型达到FID 2.26，媲美其250步教师模型；在高分辨率文本到图像MJHQ基准测试中也取得有希望的结果，证明了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高保真单步扩散模型建立了一个稳健的新范式，在保持高质量的同时显著降低了推理延迟。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩相比P帧压缩研究较少，且分层编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层次上，两个参考帧的贡献可能不平衡。

Method: 提出BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛和双向上下文融合两个核心组件。BMC在运动压缩中收敛多个光流，实现更准确的大规模运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，BRHVC在HEVC数据集上优于先前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至超越了传统编码方法VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: BRHVC通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，能够有效协调双向参考帧，在神经B帧视频压缩中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Motivation: 分形生成模型(FGM)在生成高质量图像方面很高效，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性。为了解决这个问题，需要一种能够增强生成输出多样性的方法。

Method: 1) 提出可学习的HD估计方法，直接从图像嵌入预测HD；2) 在训练时采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量驱动的调度策略；3) 在推理时使用HD引导的拒绝采样来选择几何更丰富的输出。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，FGM-HD框架相比原始FGM实现了39%的输出多样性提升，同时保持了相当的图像质量。

Conclusion: 这是首次将Hausdorff维度引入FGM的工作，有效增强了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM发展提供了理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无纸化工作流程的深入，签名从传统纸质转向电子格式。尽管有动态压力敏感和PKI数字签名，静态扫描签名因其便利性仍广泛使用。但这些静态图像几乎失去了认证属性，无法可靠验证，容易受到恶意复制和重用。

Method: 提出AuthSig框架，利用人类视觉系统对细微风格变化不敏感的特性，在生成过程中精细调制风格嵌入来隐式编码水印位。引入关键点驱动的数据增强策略，有效增强风格多样性以支持鲁棒的水印嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示，AuthSig在数字域失真和签名特定退化下达到超过98%的提取准确率，即使在打印扫描场景下仍保持有效。

Conclusion: AuthSig通过结合生成模型和水印技术，成功解决了静态电子签名的安全认证问题，实现了可靠的防复制和防重用机制。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Result: 在CS-Wild-Places数据集上平均Recall@1达到90.7%，比基线提升29.6个百分点；在Wild-Places和MulRan上分别达到91.7%和96.0%；97.2%的6-DoF配准尝试误差低于2米和5度；运行时间比RANSAC快两个数量级。

Conclusion: HOTFLoc++在具有挑战性的森林环境中实现了最先进的性能，多尺度重排序模块显著降低了定位误差，同时保持了高效的计算性能。

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波扩散Transformer的微动脉瘤检测框架WDT-MD，解决了现有扩散模型在糖尿病视网膜病变筛查中的三个关键问题：身份映射、假阳性率高和正常特征重建不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微动脉瘤是糖尿病视网膜病变的最早病理标志，但手动筛查劳动密集且易出错。现有基于扩散的异常检测方法存在身份映射、难以区分微动脉瘤与其他异常、正常特征重建不佳三大问题，阻碍了临床应用。

Method: 提出WDT-MD框架，包含三个关键创新：噪声编码图像条件机制避免身份映射；通过修复合成伪正常模式引入像素级监督；结合扩散Transformer全局建模能力与小波多尺度分析的小波扩散Transformer架构。

Result: 在IDRiD和e-ophtha MA数据集上的综合实验表明，WDT-MD在像素级和图像级微动脉瘤检测方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: WDT-MD框架显著提升了微动脉瘤检测性能，对改善早期糖尿病视网膜病变筛查具有重要前景。

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合去噪项的变分分割模型，适用于受Gamma分布乘性噪声和泊松噪声污染的图像，通过自适应TV正则化和偏置场估计处理强度不均匀性，使用ICTM和RMSAV方案进行高效优化。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型能够有效处理受噪声污染和强度不均匀的图像分割问题，在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

TL;DR: T-Rex-Omni是一个新颖的开放集目标检测框架，通过引入负视觉提示来抑制视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物，解决了现有方法仅依赖正提示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放集目标检测器仅依赖基于文本描述或视觉示例的正提示，容易受到视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物的影响，存在一致性的脆弱性。

Method: 提出统一视觉提示编码器处理正负视觉提示；设计无需训练的负向否定计算模块动态抑制负响应；开发负向否定铰链损失通过微调增强正负嵌入的判别性间隔。

Result: 实验显示显著的零样本检测性能，大幅缩小了视觉提示与文本提示方法之间的性能差距，在长尾场景中表现尤为突出（LVIS-minival上51.2 AP_r）。

Conclusion: 负提示成为推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度，T-Rex-Omni支持灵活部署，可适应用户指定或自动生成的负示例。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Motivation: 现有基于语言解码器的缓解方法通常独立调节视觉或文本注意力，忽略了它们作为两个关键因果因素的交互作用，无法有效解决物体幻觉问题。

Method: 提出VTACR指标量化解码过程中的模态贡献不平衡；设计细粒度注意力干预机制，根据VTACR信号动态调整token级和layer级注意力；采用双路径对比解码策略，一条路径强调视觉基础预测，另一条放大幻觉预测。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR基准测试中，Owl实现了显著的幻觉减少，在保持视觉语言理解能力的同时，在忠实性方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Owl通过因果建模和双模态注意力重加权，有效解决了LVLMs中的物体幻觉问题，为幻觉缓解提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Our model supports flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by adjusting the number of scales utilized. Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域且深度和可控性有限，难以泛化到多样化环境和交互格式。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测(GLP)架构，结合基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动态骨干和视频扩散解码器，在大规模视频-动作对数据上训练，支持开放领域、动作条件模拟。

Conclusion: PAN朝着通用世界模型迈进一步，能够为推理和行动提供未来世界状态的预测模拟。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Conclusion: 增强反攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提高测试时防御中的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC方法有效实现了这一目标。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

Method: TACO将回答分解为原子查询，通过转述减少对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性（黑盒）或自置信度（灰盒）聚合来估计置信度，最后用语言模型精炼答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试（POPE、MME、HallusionBench、AMBER和MM-Hal Bench）和两个MLLM模型上的实验表明，TACO持续优于直接提示和视觉对比解码，减少了系统性偏差并改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的忠实度，证明了其在减轻幻觉方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

*Amir M. Mansourian,Amir Mohammad Babaei,Shohreh Kasaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出RichKD框架，通过融合传统教师模型和CLIP的多模态知识来增强知识蒸馏效果，提升学生模型的准确性、置信度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多教师知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽视了跨模态表示的潜力。CLIP的视觉-语言知识作为补充监督源在KD领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出简单有效的框架，将传统教师的logits和特征与CLIP的logits和特征进行融合，并融入CLIP的多提示文本指导，捕获数据集特定和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Result: 融合教师产生更自信可靠的预测，显著增加自信正确案例，减少自信错误案例。与CLIP融合优化了整个logit分布，为非目标类别生成语义有意义的概率，提高了类间一致性和蒸馏质量。

Conclusion: 尽管方法简单，但RichKD在多个基准测试中持续优于现有基线，并在分布偏移和输入损坏下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: FQ-PETR是一个针对PETR系列3D检测模型的全量化框架，解决了量化过程中的精度损失问题，通过量化友好的位置嵌入、双查找表技术和数值稳定后量化等创新方法，在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降）的同时将延迟降低75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETR系列模型在3D检测基准上表现出色，但面临高计算成本和内存占用的部署挑战。直接应用现有量化方法会导致严重精度下降，主要问题包括多模态特征幅度差异大和非线性算子量化效率低。

Method: 提出FQ-PETR框架，包含三个关键技术：1）量化友好的LiDAR射线位置嵌入（QFPE），用单点采样替代多点采样；2）双查找表（DULUT）算法，用两个级联线性查找表逼近复杂非线性函数；3）数值稳定后量化（QANS），在softmax数值稳定后执行量化。

Conclusion: FQ-PETR成功解决了PETR系列模型量化部署的挑战，通过创新的量化技术实现了高精度和低延迟的平衡，为自动驾驶中的3D检测模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Conclusion: Flora方法通过创新的语义调整和流分类器设计，有效解决了零样本骨架动作识别中的关键挑战，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理、关节关系建模和时间想象力，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理模糊运动和真实场景方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Abstract: Subjective room acoustics impressions play an important role for the performance and reception of music in concert venues and auralizations. Therefore, room acoustics since the 20th century dealt with the relationship between objective, acoustic parameters and subjective impressions of room acoustics. One common approach is to correlate acoustic measures with experts' subjective ratings of rooms as recalled from their long-term memory, and explain them using acoustical measures. Another approach is to let listeners rate auralized room acoustics on bipolar scales and find objective correlates. In this study, we present an alternative approach to characterizing the subjective impressions of room acoustics. We concolve music with binaural room impulse response measurements and utilize Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) to identify the perceptual dimensions of room acoustics. Results show that the perception of room acoustics has $5$ dimensions that can be explained by the (psycho-)acoustical measures echo density, fractal correlation dimension, roughness, loudness, and early decay time.

Motivation: 研究木材老化对历史大键琴声音感知的影响，特别是杜尔肯大键琴特有的8'弦外壁固定构造的声学效果。

Method: 使用有限差分时域(FDTD)模型，测量音板497个位置的厚度和内部阻尼，通过改变阻尼参数模拟52个弦位置的脉冲响应，计算频谱质心评估音色亮度变化。

Result: 发现老化导致的亮度变化与弦位置相关：低频弦亮度增加，高频弦亮度降低，这是由频率相关的阻尼滤波效应引起的。8'弦外壁固定构造对音板张力无明显影响。

Conclusion: 木材老化对大键琴音色的影响具有频率依赖性，未来研究需要纳入粘弹性分析以进一步区分这种效应。杜尔肯大键琴的特殊构造可能有其他设计原因。

Abstract: The sound perception of wood aging is investigated on a Dulcken harpsichord of 1755 from the Museum of Applied Arts in Hamburg, Germany using a Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) model of the harpsichords soundboard. The soundboard thickness was measured on the instrument at 497 positions during strings being deattached and used in the model. Impulse responses were taken on the instrument to estimate the present internal damping by calculating the T60 decay time and used as a model input. By varying the internal damping from this measured damping as a logarithmic decrement, impulse responses were simulated at 52 string positions on both, the 8' and 4' bridge. To estimate the changed sound brightness due to changed internal damping, spectral centroids were calculated from the simulated impulse responses. A dependency of brightness change due to aging on string position was found, where the lower strings have higher brightness, as expected, while the higher strings have decreased brightness. This counterintuitive finding is caused by the frequency-dependent filter effect of changed damping. Future studies need to incorporate viscoelasticity to differentiate this effect further. Furthermore, the attachment of the 8' string to the outer instead of the inner wall, a characteristic feature of Dulcken harpsichords, is investigated using a 3D Finite-Element Method (FEM) model simulation of the whole instrument. No considerable changes on the soundboard tension were found compared to an attachment of the 8' strings to the inner wall, pointing to another reason for this special construction.

Result: 实验表明低分辨率起始检测函数(ODF)是更有效的节奏建模信号，Diff-V2M在领域内和领域外数据集上均优于现有模型，在客观指标和主观比较中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Diff-V2M通过显式节奏建模和层次化特征融合，有效解决了视频到音乐生成中的关键挑战，实现了更好的音视频对齐和音乐生成质量。

Abstract: Video-to-music (V2M) generation aims to create music that aligns with visual content. However, two main challenges persist in existing methods: (1) the lack of explicit rhythm modeling hinders audiovisual temporal alignments; (2) effectively integrating various visual features to condition music generation remains non-trivial. To address these issues, we propose Diff-V2M, a general V2M framework based on a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, comprising two core components: visual feature extraction and conditional music generation. For rhythm modeling, we begin by evaluating several rhythmic representations, including low-resolution mel-spectrograms, tempograms, and onset detection functions (ODF), and devise a rhythmic predictor to infer them directly from videos. To ensure contextual and affective coherence, we also extract semantic and emotional features. All features are incorporated into the generator via a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, where emotional features shape the affective tone via the first layer, while semantic and rhythmic features are fused in the second cross-attention layer. To enhance feature integration, we introduce timestep-aware fusion strategies, including feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) and weighted fusion, allowing the model to adaptively balance semantic and rhythmic cues throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments identify low-resolution ODF as a more effective signal for modeling musical rhythm and demonstrate that Diff-V2M outperforms existing models on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of objective metrics and subjective comparisons.

Conclusion: CLSR为推进实用的长格式口语问答应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spoken question answering (SQA) in recent years. However, many existing methods, including large audio language models, struggle with processing long audio. Follow the success of retrieval augmented generation, a speech-related retriever shows promising in help preprocessing long-form speech. But the performance of existing speech-related retrievers is lacking. To address this challenge, we propose CLSR, an end-to-end contrastive language-speech retriever that efficiently extracts question-relevant segments from long audio recordings for downstream SQA task. Unlike conventional speech-text contrastive models, CLSR incorporates an intermediate step that converts acoustic features into text-like representations prior to alignment, thereby more effectively bridging the gap between modalities. Experimental results across four cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that CLSR surpasses both end-to-end speech related retrievers and pipeline approaches combining speech recognition with text retrieval, providing a robust foundation for advancing practical long-form SQA applications.

### [54] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将无约束英语翻译为ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题。系统最小化LLM的作用，仅用于简单任务，通过AMR图系统化生成ASP约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非编程人员与代码交互的需求增加，需要一种方法让不熟悉ASP语言的用户能够通过自然语言描述逻辑问题并自动生成解决方案。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后从简化语言解析AMR图，系统化生成ASP约束，最终创建完整的ASP程序。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序，能够解决组合逻辑问题，展示了该方法在逻辑谜题上的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法是在创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题解决系统方面的重要第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出单向认知优化（UCO）方法，通过多轮交互式强化学习解决LLM作为智能导师时的两个关键挑战：无法区分学生是否真正理解vs重复答案，以及无法感知学生认知状态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教学中仅学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力。现有强化学习方法存在两个关键问题：仅基于学生输出正确性评估教学效果，无法区分真实理解与答案重复；无法通过对话实时感知学生认知状态变化。

Method: 提出UCO方法，采用多轮交互式强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：进展奖励捕捉学生认知进步，评估从困惑到理解的真正转变；支架奖励动态识别每个学生的最近发展区（ZPD），鼓励教师在该区域内保持有效教学。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模的基线模型，性能与先进闭源模型相当。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过认知进展和最近发展区感知，有效提升了LLM作为智能导师的动态适应能力，在数学教学任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Motivation: 当前时间序列预测方法大多将其视为静态的一次性映射任务，缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应性，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Method: 框架包含两个阶段：(1)自动化预测准备，构建多源认知基础；(2)生成推理和反思优化，整合统计特征、先验知识、上下文信息和预测策略，触发元推理循环进行持续自校正和策略优化。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人机协同推理框架，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和实用性，为复杂现实环境中的预测任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型表现出卓越的流畅性，但持续努力提取更强的推理能力。基于搜索的LLM计算解释，推进理解LLM推理和优化的系统性框架。

Method: 设计实验比较简单线性管道与利用递归精化层的复杂结构化管道。构建反映美国三位开国元勋历史人物的多智能体模型，使用RAG增强语料库，针对三个当代政治问题生成回应。

Result: 复杂模型在所有九个测试案例中始终优于简单模型，平均仲裁分数为88.3对71.7。复杂模型的论证在分析深度、结构细微差别和战略框架方面更优越。

Conclusion: 递归精化是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理的强大架构特征。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Conclusion: Argus框架能够有效增强端到端自动驾驶系统的韧性，显著改善驾驶性能并大幅减少安全违规，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹学优化问题建模和求解提供了稳健、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，显著降低了工业应用的专业和数据障碍。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1）经常产生包含冗余推理步骤的冗长响应（过度思考现象），显著增加计算成本。现有方法通过长度惩罚来解决此问题，但经常遭受长度崩溃和训练崩溃的问题。

Method: 提出训练简洁性奖励模型（CRM）的管道来评估推理路径的简洁性，并引入具有结果奖励与简洁性得分明确依赖关系的新颖奖励函数（CRF）。

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应token长度减少，并且在Llama和Mistral等其他LLM上也能良好泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过理论证明和实验验证，在提高推理效率的同时保持甚至提升推理准确性，为解决大型推理模型中的过度思考问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Result: 该框架为开发缓解技术提供了基础，能够减少操作期间因可靠性不确定而产生的风险。

Conclusion: 双层监控方法能够有效支持人类操作员识别不可靠输出并进行干预，为自主AI系统在高风险领域的可靠应用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedFuse框架通过MuFuse模块使用乘法融合策略处理不规则临床时间序列，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列存在不规则性、异步采样、缺失值和异质特征动态等问题，现有嵌入策略通过加法操作结合特征标识和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，在保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在涵盖重症和慢性护理的三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可泛化的方法，乘法融合策略显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

*Minlan Shao,Zijian Zhang,Yili Wang,Yiwei Dai,Xu Shen,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyperD是一个用于交通预测的新框架，通过将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差分量来应对复杂的空间依赖性和多尺度周期模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临两个关键挑战：复杂的空间依赖性和多尺度周期模式与不规则波动的共存。现有方法难以有效处理这些复杂因素。

Method: 提出HyperD框架，包含混合周期表示模块（处理周期性分量）和频率感知残差表示模块（处理非周期性波动），并引入双视图对齐损失来强制语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实世界交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测精度，同时在扰动下具有更好的鲁棒性和更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性和非周期性分量，有效解决了交通预测中的关键挑战，为智能交通系统提供了更准确的预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Roland Aydin,Christian Cyron,Steve Bachelor,Ashton Anderson,Robert West*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出从"模型训练"转向"模型培养"的新范式，将价值对齐融入模型开发全过程，通过重新设计训练语料库来实现早期价值承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值对齐，导致模型容易失准且缺乏深层次价值体系。在LLM能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练方式。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：采用第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活体验、模拟社会互动、对训练数据进行支架式排序。

Result: 预期这种训练语料库的重新设计将导致从第一个训练标记开始的早期价值承诺，使知识、技能和价值观内在更难分离。

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类能力的生态系统中，这种从模型训练向模型培养的范式转变是至关重要的需求。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

*Stine Beltoft,Lukas Galke*

TL;DR: 本文主张开发专门为定性研究设计的AI系统，以弥补当前AI在定性方法中的不足，这些系统需要具备透明、可复现和隐私友好的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和大型语言模型正在重塑科学，但定性研究被忽视。研究人员对采用AI持犹豫态度，且只能依赖通用工具如ChatGPT，这些工具存在偏见、不透明、不可复现和隐私问题。

Method: 通过回顾近期文献，展示现有自动化发现流程如何通过强大的定性能力得到增强，并识别安全定性AI在多学科和混合方法研究中的关键机会。

Result: 识别了AI在定性研究中的关键差距，并提出了开发专门定性AI系统的必要性，以促进多学科和混合方法研究的发展。

Conclusion: 需要从零开始构建专门用于解释性研究的定性AI系统，这些系统必须是透明、可复现和隐私友好的，以弥补当前AI在定性维度上的不足。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

TL;DR: 评估2025年三个前沿LLM（DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5）在PDDL规划和推理任务中的表现，发现GPT-5在标准PDDL领域与LAMA规划器竞争力相当，但在混淆测试中所有模型性能下降但降幅小于先前模型。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型的推理能力，特别是前沿模型在端到端规划任务中的表现，评估它们与专业规划器的性能差距。

Method: 使用国际规划竞赛学习赛道中的PDDL领域和任务子集，比较三个前沿LLM与LAMA规划器在标准PDDL和混淆PDDL任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-5在标准PDDL领域解决任务的能力与LAMA规划器竞争力相当；所有LLM在混淆PDDL任务中性能下降，但降幅小于先前报告的模型；相比早期LLM有显著改进。

Conclusion: 前沿LLM在规划任务上相比前代模型有实质性进步，缩小了与专业规划器在挑战性基准测试中的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: 在高维领域中进行科学发现需要访问学习表示中的信息，当前方法在解耦潜在子空间方面存在局限。

Method: 使用潜在流匹配与分类器自由引导技术，明确分离条件信息和残差表示，实现潜在子空间的解耦。

Result: 在三个实验（合成2D高斯问题、彩色MNIST和Galaxy10天文数据集）中证明该方法能够有效访问高维数据的有意义特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示提供了简单而强大的机制，为使用生成模型进行科学探索开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

*Peiyu Li,Xiaobao Huang,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试。它强调从描述转向实际操作，要求模型识别针法、选择结构适当的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过评估模型在真实创造性领域中的程序能力，揭示表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令基础以及自然语言和图像到DSL的翻译任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新的视角，并突显了在真实创造性领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距。代码已开源。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过聚合多个生成模型来增强AI安全性的架构无关方法，通过共识采样算法选择最安全的模型子集来降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全方法依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险无法仅通过检查发现，需要补充性方法来增强安全性。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，基于k个模型和提示，选择最安全的s个模型子集，当模型间缺乏足够共识时选择弃权，利用模型计算输出概率的能力。

Result: 算法能够实现与最安全s个模型平均风险相当的风险水平，并在足够多模型安全且具有足够共识时限制弃权概率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的模型无关AI安全方法，通过从模型集合中未知的安全子集放大安全保证到单个可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

### [74] [Accelerating Training Speed of Tiny Recursive Models via Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08653)
*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR提出了一种新颖的训练方法，通过将课程学习应用于架构深度而非传统数据排序，显著降低了递归推理模型的训练成本。该方法包含渐进深度课程和分层监督加权两个组件，在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上实现了1.71倍训练加速和42%成本降低，同时仅损失0.63%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归推理模型通过迭代细化在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但训练计算成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了更广泛的应用和研究。

Method: CGAR包含两个协同组件：1）渐进深度课程：在训练过程中动态调整递归深度，从浅到深配置；2）分层监督加权：对监督步骤应用指数衰减的重要性权重，使损失权重与观察到的梯度幅度衰减对齐。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上，CGAR实现了1.71倍训练加速（10.93到6.38小时，成本降低42%），准确率仅下降0.63%（86.65%到86.02%）。渐进深度课程单独实现2.26倍加速和85.47%准确率。

Conclusion: CGAR证明了在架构深度上应用原则性课程学习能够有效训练递归推理模型，在适度硬件上实现高效训练，同时提高推理效率（100%停止准确率和11%更少推理步骤）。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Method: 基于TabPFN架构的第三代模型，支持更大数据规模（5万数据点×2千特征），并引入新的蒸馏引擎将模型转换为紧凑的MLP或树集成。

Result: 在TabArena基准测试中显著优于调优的树模型，匹配AutoGluon 1.4的准确率；对小中型分类数据集有100%胜率，对大型数据集有87%胜率；蒸馏后保持大部分准确率并实现数量级延迟降低。

Conclusion: TabPFN-2.5成为表格AI领域的领先方法，为现有TabPFN生态系统的应用和方法提供即时性能增强，支持生产环境的低延迟部署。

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

TL;DR: TSGP使用预训练的transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制语义相似性生成子代程序，在24个数据集上显著优于传统GP方法，平均排名1.58，并能通过目标语义距离SD_t平衡探索与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义遗传编程依赖固定的语法变换，无法学习多样化的结构变化。TSGP旨在利用预训练transformer模型学习导致相似语义的多样化结构变化。

Method: 使用预训练的transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制目标语义距离SD_t来生成与父代程序语义相似的子代程序，实现语义空间的搜索。

Result: 在24个真实世界和合成数据集上，TSGP显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、深度符号回归和去噪自编码器GP，平均排名1.58，且比SLIM_GSGP产生更紧凑的解。

Conclusion: TSGP能够跨不同维度的符号回归问题泛化，SD_t参数有效控制语义空间步长，小值促进持续改进但程序较大，大值促进快速收敛和紧凑性，提供了平衡探索与利用的有效机制。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Motivation: 解决EEG分析中的两个关键挑战：不同记录设备和配置导致的数据集间变异性，以及EEG信号低信噪比问题。

Method: 提出位置通道嵌入编码空间信息，噪声感知掩码重建策略在原始和潜在空间进行，使用字典启发的卷积变换层结构化特征空间。

Conclusion: EEG-X为EEG分析提供了一个有效的设备无关、噪声鲁棒的基础模型，能够处理不同通道数量和组合，在跨域任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

Motivation: 研究图粗化问题，旨在在保持图结构关键特性的同时减少图的规模，这对于处理大规模图数据具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了两种算法：GPC通过迭代合并最小化局部失真的节点对；KGPC利用基于成对失真度量的聚类直接合并节点簇。

Result: 在六个大规模数据集和下游聚类任务上的验证表明，所提方法在广泛的参数和场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein几何的图粗化方法能够有效压缩图结构，同时保持重要特性，为大规模图处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Abstract: The bias-variance decomposition is a central result in statistics and machine learning, but is typically presented only for the squared error. We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes. A version of this note previously appeared on the author's personal website without context. Here we provide additional discussion and references to the relevant prior literature.

TL;DR: Interlat提出了一种基于LLM隐藏状态的新型智能体间通信范式，通过直接传输潜在空间表示来避免自然语言下采样的信息损失，并进一步压缩以加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言作为LLM智能体通信媒介存在根本限制，将丰富的内部潜在状态下采样为离散标记会限制信息传输的深度和细微差别，从而阻碍协作问题解决。

Method: 利用LLM的最后一个隐藏状态作为思维表示进行直接传输（潜在通信），并通过完全潜在空间推理进一步压缩潜在通信。

Result: 实验表明Interlat优于微调的思维链提示和单智能体基线，促进更多探索行为并实现真正利用潜在信息。进一步压缩不仅显著加速推理，还通过高效信息保留机制保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作作为完全潜在空间智能体间通信的可行性研究，结果突显其潜力，为未来研究提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven stress detection is critical for equitable mental healthcare, yet existing models frequently exhibit gender bias, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

Motivation: 在复杂动态系统设计中，确保状态轨迹收敛到期望平衡点至关重要，但稳定性区域往往难以计算。现有方法依赖系统方程知识，限制了在航空航天等实际系统中的应用。

Method: 采用二次形式的Lyapunov函数，通过最小化Zubov方程的平均残差来拟合未知二次算子，利用系统轨迹数据推断Lyapunov函数。

Conclusion: LyapInf方法提供了一种有效的黑盒系统稳定性分析方法，能够仅通过轨迹数据推断Lyapunov函数并估计稳定性区域。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

TL;DR: 提出TIGER方法，通过图嵌入和表示捕获时间信息来增强多智能体强化学习，显式建模智能体间协调结构随时间演化的过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数MARL方法依赖静态或每步关系图，忽略了智能体适应、移动或重组合作策略时自然出现的时间交互演化，而捕获这种演化依赖对于实现鲁棒和自适应协调至关重要。

Method: TIGER构建MARL智能体的动态时间图，连接当前和历史交互，使用时序注意力编码器聚合结构和时间邻域信息，生成时间感知的智能体嵌入来指导合作策略学习。

Result: 在两个协调密集型基准测试中，TIGER在任务性能和样本效率方面持续优于多种基于价值分解和图基础的MARL基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过全面消融研究揭示了结构和时间因素如何共同塑造MARL中有效的策略学习，证明了捕获时间演化协调结构的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

TL;DR: DP-PMLF是一种新颖的差分隐私随机梯度下降方法，通过集成逐样本动量和低通滤波策略，同时减轻DP噪声和裁剪偏差，显著提升了隐私-效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私深度学习方法通常只解决噪声或偏差中的一个问题，而减少DP噪声可能会加剧裁剪偏差，反之亦然。本文旨在同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 提出DP-PMLF方法，使用逐样本动量在裁剪前平滑梯度估计以减少采样方差，并采用后处理低通滤波器衰减高频DP噪声，且不消耗额外隐私预算。

Result: 理论分析显示在严格DP保证下具有改进的收敛速率，实证评估表明DP-PMLF相比多种最先进的DPSGD变体显著提升了隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: DP-PMLF通过同时减轻DP噪声和裁剪偏差，提供了一种有效的解决方案，在保持严格隐私保证的同时显著改善了模型性能。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过乘积过滤为强大的图持续描述符开辟了道路，图乘积的拓扑描述符具有更强的表达能力。

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种GNN无关的图超分辨率框架：Bi-SR通过构建二分图连接低分辨率和高分辨率节点来实现结构感知的节点超分辨率；DEFEND通过将高分辨率边映射到对偶图节点来学习边表示，实现边推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图超分辨率方法存在两个关键限制：基于矩阵的节点超分辨率忽略了图结构且缺乏置换不变性；依赖节点表示推断边权重限制了可扩展性和表达能力。

Method: 提出两种GNN无关框架：1) Bi-SR构建LR和HR节点间的二分图，保持拓扑和置换不变性；2) DEFEND将HR边映射到对偶图节点，通过标准节点GNN进行边推断。

Result: 在真实脑连接组数据集上，两种框架在七个拓扑指标上达到最先进性能。还引入了12个模拟数据集用于综合基准测试。

Conclusion: 所提框架解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持图结构的同时实现了有效的图超分辨率，为资源受限领域提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Motivation: 现有的机制可解释性方法主要在玩具模型上成功应用，但尚未扩展到真实模型。本文旨在弥合这一差距，将SPD方法扩展到现代Transformer模型。

Method: 扩展随机参数分解（SPD）到Transformer模型，提出了新的因果重要性函数（适用于序列数据）和新的损失函数。

Result: 成功分解了玩具归纳头模型并恢复了预期的2步电路；在GPT-2-small中成功定位了对应可解释概念（如"高尔夫"、"篮球"）的子组件。

Conclusion: 这是将SPD扩展到现代模型的第一步，表明该方法可以用于发现可解释的参数空间机制。

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

Motivation: 传统SWE预测方法未能充分利用时空相关性，也不提供不确定性估计，而这对水资源管理决策者具有重要价值。

Result: 在美国西部512个SNOTEL站点数据上的评估显示，在预测准确性和预测区间方面相比现有方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 这些发现为水资源管理社区的部署和反馈提供了平台，突出了不同方法在不确定性估计方面的有效性。

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工睡眠分期耗时且存在评分者间差异，现有深度学习模型主要依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：基于Transformer的每时段编码器和1D CNN聚合器，系统融合受试者临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和每时段专家事件标注（呼吸暂停、血氧下降、觉醒、周期性呼吸）。

Result: 相比仅使用PSG的基线模型（macro-F1 0.7745，micro-F1 0.8774），最终模型达到macro-F1 0.8031和micro-F1 0.9051，事件标注贡献最大增益。特征融合优于预测相同辅助标签的多任务方法。

Conclusion: 将临床意义特征融入学习表示可同时提升性能和可解释性，无需修改PSG导联或额外传感器，为构建上下文感知、专家对齐的睡眠分期系统提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从业者在部署时间序列预测模型时面临困境：详尽验证数十个模型计算成本过高，但选择错误模型会导致性能不佳。需要一种快速评估方法来指导模型选择。

Method: 使用谱可预测性Ω作为信号处理指标，在四个不同领域进行受控实验，并在GIFT-Eval基准测试的51个模型和28个数据集上扩展分析。

Result: 大型时间序列基础模型在Ω高时系统性地优于轻量级基线，但随着Ω下降其优势消失。计算Ω每个数据集只需几秒钟，能快速评估数据是否适合TSFM方法。

Conclusion: Ω能够可预测地分层模型性能，提供了一个实用的初步筛选工具，既能降低验证成本，又凸显了需要开发在真正困难（低Ω）问题上表现出色的模型。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Conclusion: DIVO在离线强化学习中实现了保守性与可探索性之间的关键平衡，通过价值条件优化有效提升了策略性能。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: We present TransactionGPT (TGPT), a foundation model for consumer transaction data within one of world's largest payment networks. TGPT is designed to understand and generate transaction trajectories while simultaneously supporting a variety of downstream prediction and classification tasks. We introduce a novel 3D-Transformer architecture specifically tailored for capturing the complex dynamics in payment transaction data. This architecture incorporates design innovations that enhance modality fusion and computational efficiency, while seamlessly enabling joint optimization with downstream objectives. Trained on billion-scale real-world transactions, TGPT significantly improves downstream classification performance against a competitive production model and exhibits advantages over baselines in generating future transactions. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations utilizing a diverse collection of company transaction datasets spanning multiple downstream tasks, thereby enabling a thorough assessment of TGPT's effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to established methodologies. Furthermore, we examine the incorporation of LLM-derived embeddings within TGPT and benchmark its performance against fine-tuned LLMs, demonstrating that TGPT achieves superior predictive accuracy as well as faster training and inference. We anticipate that the architectural innovations and practical guidelines from this work will advance foundation models for transaction-like data and catalyze future research in this emerging field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种二阶确定性actor-critic强化学习框架，利用性能函数的曲率信息来扩展经典确定性策略梯度方法，通过二次critic和最小二乘时序差分学习实现更快的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典确定性策略梯度方法只使用一阶信息，收敛速度较慢，需要利用性能函数的曲率信息来加速收敛过程。

Method: 引入兼容函数近似的二次critic，同时保留真实策略梯度和性能Hessian矩阵的近似；开发最小二乘时序差分学习方案高效估计二次critic参数；使用critic学习的信息进行拟牛顿actor更新。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法相比标准确定性actor-critic基线实现了改进的收敛性和性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的二阶确定性actor-critic框架能够利用曲率信息，在可微分策略类上实现更快的收敛速度，优于一阶方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的后门移除方法，通过准确重构潜在表示中的触发激活变化(TAC)值来识别和消除后门神经元，解决了现有方法因TAC估计不准确导致的低精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法基于触发激活变化(TAC)来识别和移除后门神经元，但由于TAC值估计不准确，导致识别真正后门神经元的精度较低。

Method: 将最小扰动问题建模为凸二次优化问题，其最优解作为TAC的替代；通过检测扰动L2范数的统计显著性来识别中毒类别，并在微调中利用中毒类别的扰动来移除后门。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、GTSRB和TinyImageNet上的实验表明，该方法在不同攻击类型、数据集和架构下都能持续实现优越的后门抑制效果，并保持高清洁准确率，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过准确重构TAC值，能够有效识别和移除后门，在各种场景下都表现出优异的防御性能。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

TL;DR: 提出Bayesian-MoE框架，基于混合专家架构为微调后的大语言模型提供后验不确定性估计，无需修改训练过程或添加参数，通过结构化拉普拉斯近似实现校准的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常对添加的适配器模块应用贝叶斯推断，而Bayesian-MoE直接针对MoE模型中已有的专家路径，利用其模块化设计实现可处理的块级后验估计。

Method: 对每个专家的第二线性层应用结构化拉普拉斯近似，使用克罗内克分解低秩近似建模曲率，推导可扩展的预测不确定性和边际似然估计。

Result: 在常识推理基准测试中，使用Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE的实验表明，Bayesian-MoE相比基线方法在预期校准误差和负对数似然方面均有改善。

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE框架有效提升了MoE模型在下游决策中的可靠性，为微调后的大语言模型提供了实用的不确定性估计解决方案。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Method: BRIDGE设计复用已完成试验中传统模型和更新AI模型预测一致的参与者数据，减少新试验的入组需求，并提供检查清单确保因果推断有效性。

Result: 在乳腺癌、心血管疾病和脓毒症的真实数据中，连续AI模型预测一致性高达64.8%；模拟乳腺癌筛查研究显示入组需求减少46.6%，节省280万美元，同时保持80%的统计功效。

Conclusion: BRIDGE设计将试验转化为适应性模块化研究，使每个模型迭代都能获得一级证据，加速AI在常规护理中的成本效益转化。

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Conclusion: 该框架为高维非欧几里得流形数据聚类提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，特别适用于对称正定矩阵等复杂流形。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

TL;DR: FedSDWC是一种基于因果推断的联邦学习方法，通过建模不变特征和可变特征之间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示，有效解决了数据分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）的挑战，影响其在真实部署中的可靠性，需要新的方法来提升泛化能力和OOD检测能力。

Method: 提出FedSDWC方法，整合不变特征和可变特征，通过建模它们之间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示，克服现有不变学习方法在准确捕捉不变特征和直接构建因果表示方面的局限性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了FedSDWC在处理协变量和语义偏移方面的优越性能，在CIFAR-10上平均比次优基线FedICON高出3.04%，在CIFAR-100上高出8.11%。

Conclusion: FedSDWC显著增强了联邦学习的泛化能力和OOD数据检测能力，理论上推导了特定条件下的泛化误差界，并首次建立了与客户端先验分布的关系。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: 该方法为更广泛应用中可证明高效的交互式偏好获取提供了潜力，展示了模型无关方法的竞争优势。

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的联邦学习二阶优化方法（如LocalNewton、LTDA、FedSophia）在客户端执行局部更新并在服务器上进行简单参数混合，但在异构数据设置下容易产生局部预条件器漂移，严重影响参数训练的收敛性。

Method: 通过将理想的二阶更新分解为服务器上的参数混合和客户端上的局部参数更新，在服务器上引入预条件局部参数混合机制，有效缓解局部预条件器漂移问题。

Conclusion: FedPM通过预条件混合机制有效解决了二阶联邦学习中的局部预条件器漂移问题，充分发挥了二阶优化的潜力，在异构数据环境下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实系统中的部署增加，理解其脆弱性变得至关重要。虽然RLHF/DPO对齐过程中的数据投毒攻击已有实证研究，但其理论基础仍不清楚。

Method: 将投毒攻击建模为带线性约束的凸优化问题，推导最小攻击成本的下界和上界，并提出成本最小化后处理方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了RLHF/DPO流程中的基本脆弱性，并提供了评估其对低成本投毒攻击鲁棒性的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: 提出的链式框架能够有效估计高斯过程回归的全局和局部不确定性边界，在保持理论保证的同时提供了更紧的边界估计。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GroupFS能够有效发现和选择有意义的特征组，在无监督特征选择任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

*Guojian Wang,Quinson Hon,Xuyang Chen,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFDT通过两级数据过滤和优势条件令牌解决了决策变换器在跨域迁移中的轨迹拼接问题，提升了策略性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域策略适应方法依赖单一过滤标准选择源轨迹片段，但拼接后状态结构错位、RTG不可比、动作在连接处跳跃，导致RTG令牌失去连续性，影响DT推理能力。

Method: DFDT采用最大均值差异(MMD)进行状态结构对齐，最优传输(OT)偏差进行动作可行性评估，通过两级数据过滤器融合稀缺目标数据和可信源片段，使用可行性加权的融合分布进行训练，并用优势条件令牌替代RTG令牌，应用Q引导正则化器抑制连接处的值和动作跳跃。

Result: 在D4RL风格控制任务的重力、运动学和形态变化场景中，DFDT相比强离线RL和序列模型基线提高了回报和稳定性，并通过令牌拼接和序列语义稳定性分析验证了这些增益。

Conclusion: DFDT通过恢复拼接性有效解决了决策变换器的跨域迁移挑战，理论分析表明状态值和策略性能差距与MMD不匹配和OT偏差度量相关，且随着这两个度量的减小而收紧。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

### [109] [FSampler: Training Free Acceleration of Diffusion Sampling via Epsilon Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09180)
*Michael A. Vladimir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler是一个无需训练、与采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样。它使用历史去噪信号进行外推预测，在特定步骤用预测值替代模型调用，同时保持采样器更新规则不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少扩散采样过程中的函数评估次数，从而加速采样过程，同时保持高保真度。

Method: FSampler维护最近模型调用的去噪信号历史，使用有限差分预测器（二阶、三阶或四阶）外推下一个epsilon值。在选定步骤用预测值替代模型调用，包含学习稳定器、梯度估计稳定器、保护窗口和周期性锚点等机制来确保稳定性。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2模型上，FSampler将时间减少8-22%，模型调用减少15-25%，同时保持高保真度（SSIM 0.95-0.99）。使用激进自适应门时，模型调用可减少45-50%，但保真度较低（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种有效的扩散采样加速方法，无需修改采样器公式，可与多种采样器集成，在保持高质量的同时显著减少计算成本。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Motivation: 当前AI文本检测器的训练和评估依赖于高质量的基准数据集，但现有数据集如DetectRL存在质量问题，包含简单的AI生成模式，导致检测器容易受到欺骗攻击。

Method: 作者对DetectRL数据集进行了多种清洗操作，移除了包含简单AI生成模式的数据，如开头语和任务拒绝实例。

Result: 实验表明，经过数据清洗后，直接攻击检测器变得更加困难。清洗后的数据集已公开可用。

Conclusion: 数据清洗对于提高AI文本检测器的鲁棒性至关重要，能够减少检测器对简单模式的依赖，增强对抗攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

Theoretical results illustrating the convergence of the proposed approach, and its relative performances is evaluated on synthesized 2-dimensional samples generated by a Gaussian mixture distribution and compared with state-of-the-art methods. It can be observed that in most cases the stochastic mean-shift clustering outperforms the standard mean-shift. We also illustrate as a practical application the use of the presented method for speaker clustering.

Conclusion: SCMax框架提供了一种有效的无参数聚类解决方案，能够自动确定最优聚类数量。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Feynman-Kac（FK）引导框架，将其应用于基于扩散的蛋白质设计，能够在推理时引导采样过程朝向特定功能或生化目标，同时保持扩散过程的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的蛋白质结构生成模型难以有效引导结果朝向特定功能目标（如结合亲和力或序列组成），需要一种能够在推理时进行控制的方法。

Method: 将FK引导框架与结构生成相结合，通过计算在ProteinMPNN和全原子松弛精炼模型上的奖励函数，同时生成序列和结构特性，引导采样过程。

Result: 在结合剂设计中，FK引导一致改善了预测的界面能量学，且计算开销最小。该方法能够处理任意、不可微分和奖励无关的目标。

Conclusion: 推理时FK控制将基于扩散的蛋白质设计推广到任意目标，为引导分子生成提供了一个统一且模型无关的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的双重攻击DFA，同时破坏联邦学习中的模型效用和群体公平性，并开发了GuardFed防御框架来有效应对这种威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但仍易受同时破坏模型效用和公平性的攻击，而现有研究主要关注单一目标的攻击，缺乏对双重攻击的深入探索。

Method: 提出了两种DFA攻击变体（S-DFA和Sp-DFA），并开发了GuardFed防御框架，通过维护公平感知参考模型和计算双视角信任评分来选择性聚合客户端更新。

Result: 实验表明现有鲁棒联邦学习防御无法有效抵抗DFA攻击，而GuardFed在各种非独立同分布和对抗条件下能持续保持准确性和公平性。

Conclusion: GuardFed在保护联邦学习模型效用和公平性方面达到了最先进的性能，为应对双重攻击提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Motivation: 传统多臂赌博机问题假设固定动态，这在非平稳环境中往往不成立。为了解决实际应用中环境动态变化的问题，需要开发能够适应潜在状态切换的模型。

Method: 提出了MARBLE模型，为多臂赌博机问题添加了潜在马尔可夫状态；引入了马尔可夫平均可索引性准则；开发了同步Q学习与Whittle索引算法。

Result: 在未观测到状态切换的情况下，QWI算法能够几乎必然收敛到最优Q函数和相应的Whittle索引；在校准的模拟器嵌入式推荐系统上验证了模型有效性。

Conclusion: MARBLE模型成功扩展了多臂赌博机问题到非平稳环境，QWI算法能够在潜在状态变化的环境中自适应并收敛到最优策略，理论结果得到了实证支持。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: DFAX方法克服了现有特征归因方法的局限性，提供了更有效和高效的解释能力，为特征归因领域建立了正式的问题定义框架。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SHAP计算方法效率有限，特别是在处理大规模数据集时。WOODELF旨在提供一种更高效的SHAP计算框架，支持多种博弈论值的快速计算。

Method: 为每个消费者构建伪布尔公式，捕捉特征值、决策树集成结构和整个背景数据集，然后利用这种表示在线性时间内计算Background SHAP。

Result: 在包含300万行、500万背景样本和127个特征的数据集上，WOODELF在CPU上162秒、GPU上16秒完成所有Background Shapley值计算，相比最佳方法分别实现了16倍和165倍的加速。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一个高效、可扩展的SHAP计算框架，能够显著加速博弈论值的计算，并支持多种硬件平台。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法为在真实临床环境中实现新型、成本效益高且患者友好的PET几何结构提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CREAT的约束强化学习驱动的配置文件污染攻击方法，通过双层次优化框架和多奖励强化学习来平衡攻击效果和隐蔽性，解决了现有PPA方法在细粒度扰动和可检测性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列推荐系统的对抗攻击主要依赖数据投毒，需要大规模用户访问或虚假配置文件，缺乏实用性。现有PPA方法存在两个局限：过度依赖序列水平影响限制了项目转换的细粒度扰动，以及整体修改导致可检测的分布偏移。

Method: 提出CREAT方法，结合双层次优化框架和多奖励强化学习。开发模式平衡奖励策略，集成模式反转奖励和分布一致性奖励；采用约束组相对强化学习范式，通过动态屏障约束和组共享经验回放实现逐步扰动。

Conclusion: CREAT方法通过约束强化学习框架成功解决了现有PPA方法的局限性，实现了更细粒度的扰动和更好的隐蔽性，为序列推荐系统的安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Conclusion: AGT填补了训练数据扰动认证研究的空白，为对抗数据投毒、机器去学习和差分隐私等场景提供了形式化认证工具。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PTE的免保留遗忘框架，通过探测-编辑过程实现选择性遗忘，仅需遗忘数据和原始模型即可高效完成知识编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态工业物联网环境中，模型需要能够选择性遗忘过时或错误知识。现有方法通常依赖保留数据来约束模型行为，这会增加计算和能耗负担，且与工业数据孤岛和隐私合规要求相冲突。

Method: PTE将遗忘定义为探测-编辑过程：首先通过梯度上升探测模型在待遗忘类别决策边界邻域，并利用模型自身预测生成编辑指令；然后执行推拉协作优化：推分支使用编辑指令主动拆除目标类别的决策区域，拉分支应用掩码知识蒸馏将模型在保留类别上的知识锚定到原始状态。

Result: 实验结果表明，PTE在CWRU和SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准测试中，在遗忘有效性和模型效用之间实现了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: 得益于该机制，PTE仅使用待遗忘数据和原始模型即可实现高效且平衡的知识编辑，解决了现有方法依赖保留数据的问题。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Conclusion: 该框架成功增强了SEP预测模型的透明度，为太阳物理学家提供了更深入的物理洞察，有助于理解太阳高能粒子事件的物理成因。

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Method: 使用监督对比学习构建评估对齐的嵌入空间，在该空间中通过邻近性捕获结果相似性，使用单个全局优势向量从输到赢区域定向空间，通过候选动作与优势向量方向的对齐度进行排序来实现规划。

Result: 在象棋中，SOLIS仅使用浅层搜索和学习的嵌入指导就能在受限条件下达到竞争性强度。

Conclusion: 评估对齐的潜在规划为传统动态模型或策略学习提供了轻量级替代方案，展示了在潜在空间中进行直接规划的有效性。

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

Motivation: 解决专业任务中监督微调需要高质量数据集但人工标注成本高昂的问题，特别是针对主观、开放式任务中现有方法面临的冷启动问题。

Method: 将问题重新定义为蒙特卡洛树搜索，使用无数据集混合奖励进行指导，包含两个LLM作为评判组件：一个评估样本质量，另一个评估工作流代码和提示质量。

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了数据为中心AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了可扩展、成本效益高的方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

Conclusion: GenePheno为从基因序列直接预测多表型异常提供了有效的可解释框架，推动了假设驱动实验的可扩展性。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Motivation: 研究组合多物品市场中存在市场出清价格和容量可行分配的情况，但玩家可能无法获得最优效用，因此引入遗憾概念来量化这种效用差距。

Method: 提出Δ-遗憾瓦尔拉斯均衡概念，建立与对偶间隙和整数性间隙的理论联系，利用线性优化的灵敏度理论分析可实现的遗憾界限，并将社会福利近似算法转化为低遗憾均衡算法。

Conclusion: 该框架为组合多物品市场提供了系统的均衡分析方法，将社会福利优化与市场均衡联系起来，并为设计低遗憾均衡算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We consider combinatorial multi-item markets and propose the notion of a $Δ$-regret Walras equilibrium, which is an allocation of items to players and a set of item prices that achieve the following goals: prices clear the market, the allocation is capacity-feasible, and the players' strategies lead to a total regret of $Δ$. The regret is defined as the sum of individual player regrets measured by the utility gap with respect to the optimal item bundle given the prices. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of $Δ$-regret equilibria, where we establish a connection to the duality gap and the integrality gap of the social welfare problem. For the special case of monotone valuations, the derived necessary and sufficient optimality conditions coincide and lead to a complete characterization of achievable $Δ$-regret equilibria. For general valuations, we establish an interesting connection to the area of sensitivity theory in linear optimization. We show that the sensitivity gap of the optimal-value function of two (configuration) linear programs with changed right-hand side can be used to establish a bound on the achievable regret. Finally, we use these general structural results to translate known approximation algorithms for the social welfare optimization problem into algorithms computing low-regret Walras equilibria. We also demonstrate how to derive strong lower bounds based on integrality and duality gaps but also based on NP-complexity theory.

Conclusion: 该框架在经典代表性非合作博弈上验证了理论结果，展示了其应用潜力，能够有效解决博弈中的多重均衡和不良结果问题。

Abstract: In dynamic noncooperative games, each player makes conjectures about other players' reactions before choosing a strategy. However, resulting equilibria may be multiple and do not always lead to desirable outcomes. These issues are typically addressed separately, for example, through opponent modelling and incentive design. Drawing inspiration from conjectural variations games, we propose an incentive design framework in which a coordinator first computes an equilibrium by optimizing a predefined objective function, then communicates this equilibrium as a target for the players to reach. In a centralized setting, the coordinator also optimizes the conjectures to steer the players towards the target. In decentralized settings, players independently compute conjectures and update their strategies based on individual targets. We provide a guarantee of equilibrium existence in both cases. This framework uses conjectures not only to guide the system towards desirable outcomes but also to decouple the game into independent optimization problems, enabling efficient computation and parallelization in large-scale settings. We illustrate our theoretical results on classical representative noncooperative games, demonstrating its application potential.

Abstract: Despite extensive theoretical research on proportionality in approval-based multiwinner voting, its impact on which committees and candidates can be selected in practice remains poorly understood. We address this gap by (i) analyzing the computational complexity of several natural problems related to the behavior of proportionality axioms, and (ii) conducting an extensive experimental study on both real-world and synthetic elections. Our findings reveal substantial variation in the restrictiveness of proportionality across instances, including previously unobserved high levels of restrictiveness in some real-world cases. We also introduce and evaluate new measures for quantifying a candidate's importance for achieving proportional outcomes, which differ clearly from assessing candidate strength by approval score.

Abstract: Long-term state estimation over graphs remains challenging as current graph estimation methods scale poorly on large, long-term graphs. To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities have been achieved by robotics and AI, mastering complex tasks and environments. Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop. Finally, we highlight trends and promising directions toward more adaptive, accessible HRC.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ATOM-CBF是一个新型安全控制框架，通过自适应感知误差边界和实时调整保守度的安全过滤器，解决了学习感知模块在遇到训练时未见数据时的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统的安全性面临挑战，特别是当它们依赖学习感知模块从高维传感器数据推断系统状态时。这些感知模块容易受到认知不确定性的影响，在遇到训练时未见的数据时容易失败。

Method: 提出了ATOM-CBF框架，包含两个关键组件：(1) OoD感知的自适应感知误差边界，(2) 集成这种自适应误差边界的安全过滤器，使其能够实时调整保守度。

Result: 在模拟环境中进行了实证验证，证明了ATOM-CBF能够为配备LiDAR扫描的F1Tenth车辆和使用RGB图像的四足机器人保持安全性。

Conclusion: ATOM-CBF框架能够显式计算并适应来自OoD测量的认知不确定性，无需真实标签或分布偏移信息，有效解决了学习感知系统的安全问题。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of real-world systems is challenging, especially when they rely on learned perception modules to infer the system state from high-dimensional sensor data. These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time. We provide empirical validation in simulations, demonstrating that ATOM-CBF maintains safety for an F1Tenth vehicle with LiDAR scans and a quadruped robot with RGB images.

TL;DR: CENIC是一种新的连续时间积分器，结合了凸时间步进和误差控制积分的最新进展，解决了传统离散时间模拟器需要手动选择时间步长的问题，以及现有误差控制积分器难以处理接触刚性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人模拟器在离散时间下运行，需要手动选择时间步长，大步长会产生非物理现象，小步长则运行缓慢。现有误差控制积分器难以处理接触刚度问题，无法满足现代机器人工作流程的速度和可扩展性要求。

Method: CENIC结合了凸时间步进和误差控制积分的最新进展，继承了连续积分和离散时间步进的优点，能够自动调整时间步长以达到所需精度。

Result: CENIC运行速度与MuJoCo、Drake和Isaac Sim等离散时间机器人模拟器相当，达到快速实时速率，同时提供精度和收敛性保证。

Conclusion: CENIC成功解决了传统模拟器的时间步长选择难题，在保持高速运行的同时提供了精度保证，为机器人模拟提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art robotics simulators operate in discrete time. This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids such issues by automatically adjusting the time step to achieve a desired accuracy. But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping. CENIC runs at fast real-time rates comparable to discrete-time robotics simulators like MuJoCo, Drake and Isaac Sim, while also providing guarantees on accuracy and convergence.

Abstract: High degree-of-freedom dual-arm robots are becoming increasingly common due to their morphology enabling them to operate effectively in human environments. However, motion planning in real-time within unknown, changing environments remains a challenge for such robots due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and the complex collision-avoidance constraints that must be obeyed. In this work, we propose a novel way to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by leveraging the structure imposed by shared joints (e.g. torso joints) in a dual-arm robot. First, we build two dynamic roadmaps (DRM) for each kinematic chain (i.e. left arm + torso, right arm + torso) with specific structure induced by the shared joints. Then, we show that we can leverage this structure to efficiently search through the composition of the two roadmaps and largely sidestep the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we run several experiments in a real-world grocery store with this motion planner on a 19 DoF mobile manipulation robot executing a grocery fulfillment task, achieving 0.4s average planning times with 99.9% success rate across more than 2000 motion plans.

To enable X-band radar-only autonomous navigation in maritime environments, this paper proposes a place recognition algorithm specifically tailored for X-band radar, incorporating an object density-based rule for efficient candidate selection and intentional degradation of radar detections to achieve robust retrieval performance. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on both public maritime radar datasets and our own collected dataset, and its performance was compared against state-of-the-art radar place recognition methods. An ablation study was conducted to assess the algorithm's performance sensitivity with respect to key parameters.

Abstract: In mobile robot shared control, effectively understanding human motion intention is critical for seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper presents a novel shared control framework featuring planning-level intention prediction. A path replanning algorithm is designed to adjust the robot's desired trajectory according to inferred human intentions. To represent future motion intentions, we introduce the concept of an intention domain, which serves as a constraint for path replanning. The intention-domain prediction and path replanning problems are jointly formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved through deep reinforcement learning. In addition, a Voronoi-based human trajectory generation algorithm is developed, allowing the model to be trained entirely in simulation without human participation or demonstration data. Extensive simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces operator workload and enhances safety, without compromising task efficiency compared with existing assistive teleoperation approaches.

Conclusion: SCOPE通过显式利用边界信息和自我重新考虑机制，有效提升了零样本具身视觉导航的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Embodied visual navigation remains a challenging task, as agents must explore unknown environments with limited knowledge. Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\% in accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates that its core components lead to improved calibration, stronger generalization, and higher decision quality.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更具能力的具身智能体开辟了新路径，通过将高级规划外包给视觉语言模型，实现了更智能的导航指导。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are set to transform robotic navigation, existing methods often underutilize their reasoning capabilities. To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. When tested on challenging benchmarks like HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D, this method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories, marking a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches and charting a path toward more capable embodied agents.

Abstract: Autonomous driving holds transformative potential but remains fundamentally constrained by the limited perception and isolated decision-making with standalone intelligence. While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), effective path planning has become increasingly important. Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy. Furthermore, real-world validations on UAV three-dimensional path planning and three engineering design tasks confirm its practical applicability and effectiveness in field robotics missions requiring intelligent, adaptive, and time-efficient planning.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have achieved significant advances, and full autonomy within defined operational design domains near practical deployment. Expanding these domains requires addressing safety assurance under diverse conditions. Information sharing through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, enabled by a Dynamic Map platform built from vehicle and roadside sensor data, offers a promising solution. Real-world experiments with numerous infrastructure sensors incur high costs and regulatory challenges. Conventional single-host simulators lack the capacity for large-scale urban traffic scenarios. This paper proposes D-AWSIM, a distributed simulator that partitions its workload across multiple machines to support the simulation of extensive sensor deployment and dense traffic environments. A Dynamic Map generation framework on D-AWSIM enables researchers to explore information-sharing strategies without relying on physical testbeds. The evaluation shows that D-AWSIM increases throughput for vehicle count and LiDAR sensor processing substantially compared to a single-machine setup. Integration with Autoware demonstrates applicability for autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Learning natural, animal-like locomotion from demonstrations has become a core paradigm in legged robotics. Despite the recent advancements in motion tracking, most existing methods demand extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability. We present APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient Exploration), a plug-and-play extension to state-of-the-art motion tracking algorithms that eliminates any dependence on reference data during deployment, improves sample efficiency, and reduces parameter tuning effort. APEX integrates expert demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is combined with a multi-critic framework that balances task performance with motion style. Moreover, APEX enables a single policy to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, while remaining robust to variations in reward design. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation and on a Unitree Go2 robot. By leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration during RL training, without imposing explicit bias toward them, APEX enables legged robots to learn with greater stability, efficiency, and generalization. We believe this approach paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in a wide array of robotic tasks, from locomotion to manipulation.

Abstract: Antagonistic soft actuators built from artificial muscles (PAMs, HASELs, DEAs) promise plant-level torque-stiffness decoupling, yet existing controllers for soft muscles struggle to maintain independent control through dynamic contact transients. We present a unified framework enabling independent torque and stiffness commands in real-time for diverse soft actuator types. Our unified force law captures diverse soft muscle physics in a single model with sub-ms computation, while our cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics maintains decoupling despite model errors and disturbances. Using co-contraction/bias coordinates, the controller independently modulates torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction-replicating biological impedance strategies. Simulation-based validation through contact experiments demonstrates maintained independence: 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies. This framework provides a foundation for enabling musculoskeletal antagonistic systems to execute adaptive impedance control for safe human-robot interaction.

Motivation: 现有数据集评估方法主要关注多样性，通常通过统计任务和场景或评估孤立模态来实现，但无法全面衡量数据集多样性。同时，数据集的可学习性研究较少，通常需要通过昂贵的模型训练进行事后评估，缺乏可解释性和指导性。

Method: 1. 为每个数据样本构建统一的多模态表示，基于此提出多样性熵来衡量数据集信息量；2. 引入首个可解释的数据驱动算法，无需训练即可高效量化数据集可学习性。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界具身数据集上的验证表明，该算法能够产生可靠、可操作的见解，使研究人员能够同时改进数据集的多样性和可学习性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为设计更高质量的具身智能数据集奠定了基础，有望推动具身智能的发展。

Abstract: In embodied intelligence, datasets play a pivotal role, serving as both a knowledge repository and a conduit for information transfer. The two most critical attributes of a dataset are the amount of information it provides and how easily this information can be learned by models. However, the multimodal nature of embodied data makes evaluating these properties particularly challenging. Prior work has largely focused on diversity, typically counting tasks and scenes or evaluating isolated modalities, which fails to provide a comprehensive picture of dataset diversity. On the other hand, the learnability of datasets has received little attention and is usually assessed post-hoc through model training, an expensive, time-consuming process that also lacks interpretability, offering little guidance on how to improve a dataset. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing two principled, data-driven tools. First, we construct a unified multimodal representation for each data sample and, based on it, propose diversity entropy, a continuous measure that characterizes the amount of information contained in a dataset. Second, we introduce the first interpretable, data-driven algorithm to efficiently quantify dataset learnability without training, enabling researchers to assess a dataset's learnability immediately upon its release. We validate our algorithm on both simulated and real-world embodied datasets, demonstrating that it yields faithful, actionable insights that enable researchers to jointly improve diversity and learnability. We hope this work provides a foundation for designing higher-quality datasets that advance the development of embodied intelligence.

### [152] [LODESTAR: Degeneracy-Aware LiDAR-Inertial Odometry with Adaptive Schmidt-Kalman Filter and Data Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09142)
*Eungchang Mason Lee,Kevin Christiansen Marsim,Hyun Myung*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LODESTAR是一种新颖的LiDAR-惯性里程计方法，通过退化解感知的自适应Schmidt-Kalman滤波器和退化解感知数据利用两个关键模块，解决在退化环境（如长走廊、高空飞行）中LiDAR测量不平衡或稀疏导致的病态状态估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR-惯性里程计在退化环境中性能下降，因为LiDAR测量不平衡或稀疏会导致病态状态估计，需要解决这些退化问题以提高准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两个关键模块：DA-ASKF（退化解感知自适应Schmidt-Kalman滤波器）使用滑动窗口利用过去状态和测量作为额外约束，通过退化解感知滑动模式自适应分类状态；DA-DE（退化解感知数据利用）基于局部化贡献和雅可比矩阵条件数，修剪非信息性测量并选择性利用固定状态的测量。

Result: 实验结果表明，LODESTAR在各种退化条件下，在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有的基于LiDAR的里程计方法和退化解感知模块。

Conclusion: LODESTAR通过退化解感知约束优化和测量稀疏性缓解，以及测量不平衡处理，有效解决了LiDAR-惯性里程计在退化环境中的性能问题，展示了优越的性能表现。

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) has been widely used in robotics due to its high accuracy. However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors--akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance. Experimental results show that LODESTAR outperforms existing LiDAR-based odometry methods and degeneracy-aware modules in terms of accuracy and robustness under various degenerate conditions.

TL;DR: Humanoid-Union是一个通过自动化管道生成的大规模人形机器人运动数据集，包含260+小时多样化高质量运动数据，基于人类运动视频生成。基于此提出了SCHUR框架，探索大规模数据对人形机器人高级控制的影响。

Motivation: 解决机器人学习中数据扩展的瓶颈问题，利用丰富的人类视频和运动数据作为免费的大规模数据源，探索如何有效挖掘原始视频、提取机器人可学习表示并用于可扩展学习。

Method: 开发自动化管道生成Humanoid-Union数据集，包含语义标注的人形机器人运动数据；提出SCHUR可扩展学习框架，研究大规模数据对高级控制的影响。

Result: SCHUR在数据和模型扩展下实现了高质量机器人运动生成和强文本-运动对齐，MPJPE重建改进37%，FID对齐改进25%，并在真实人形机器人上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: Humanoid-Union数据集和SCHUR框架成功解决了人形机器人学习中的数据瓶颈问题，证明了大规模数据对高级控制的重要影响，为可扩展机器人学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data scaling has long remained a critical bottleneck in robot learning. For humanoid robots, human videos and motion data are abundant and widely available, offering a free and large-scale data source. Besides, the semantics related to the motions enable modality alignment and high-level robot control learning. However, how to effectively mine raw video, extract robot-learnable representations, and leverage them for scalable learning remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos. The dataset can be further expanded via the same pipeline. Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods. Its effectiveness is further validated through deployment in real-world humanoid robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UMIGen是一个统一框架，包含Cloud-UMI手持数据采集设备和可见性感知优化机制，能够高效生成与真实自我中心3D观察对齐的数据，支持跨机器人具身的强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的机器人学习面临困境：鲁棒策略需要大规模高质量演示数据，但数据收集存在高成本、依赖专用硬件和空间泛化能力有限等问题。UMI虽然降低了硬件要求，但仅捕获RGB图像而缺少3D几何信息。

Method: 提出UMIGen框架，包含两个关键组件：1) Cloud-UMI手持数据采集设备，无需视觉SLAM同时记录点云观察-动作对；2) 可见性感知优化机制，将DemoGen管道扩展到自我中心3D观察，仅生成相机视野内的点。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中的实验表明，UMIGen支持强跨具身泛化能力，并加速了多种操作任务的数据收集。

Conclusion: UMIGen实现了高效的数据生成，能够直接在不同机器人具身之间转移而无需后处理，解决了机器人学习中的数据收集挑战。

Abstract: Data-driven robotic learning faces an obvious dilemma: robust policies demand large-scale, high-quality demonstration data, yet collecting such data remains a major challenge owing to high operational costs, dependence on specialized hardware, and the limited spatial generalization capability of current methods. The Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) relaxes the strict hardware requirements for data collection, but it is restricted to capturing only RGB images of a scene and omits the 3D geometric information on which many tasks rely. Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that UMIGen supports strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerates data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 解决人形机器人和灵巧手控制中的数据稀缺问题，利用丰富的人类运动数据来克服机器人特定数据收集成本高昂的挑战。

Method: 采用基于物理的重新定位方法，结合课程式虚拟接触指导，通过大规模物理采样将仅包含运动学信息的人类演示转化为动态可行的机器人轨迹。

Result: 在9种不同人形/灵巧手机器人和6个数据集上验证，成功率比标准采样提高18%，比强化学习基线快10倍，生成了240万帧动态可行机器人数据集。

Conclusion: SPIDER作为一种通用的基于物理的重新定位方法，能够处理不同质量的数据并生成多样化高质量数据，有效支持强化学习等策略学习方法。

Abstract: Learning dexterous and agile policy for humanoid and dexterous hand control requires large-scale demonstrations, but collecting robot-specific data is prohibitively expensive. In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning. As a universal physics-based retargeting method, SPIDER can work with diverse quality data and generate diverse and high-quality data to enable efficient policy learning with methods like RL.

TL;DR: 提出了WMPO框架，通过基于像素预测的世界模型实现VLA模型的在线强化学习，无需真实环境交互，显著提升样本效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型依赖专家演示无法从失败中学习的问题，以及强化学习在真实机器人上样本复杂度高的问题。

Method: 基于像素预测的世界模型方法，将"想象"轨迹与预训练的VLA特征对齐，实现在线GRPO策略优化。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，WMPO显著提升样本效率、整体性能，展现出自我纠正、泛化能力和终身学习能力。

Conclusion: WMPO为VLA模型提供了一种无需真实环境交互的高效强化学习框架，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation, but their reliance on expert demonstrations limits their ability to learn from failures and perform self-corrections. Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses these through self-improving interactions with the physical environment, but suffers from high sample complexity on real robots. We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the "imagined" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.

TL;DR: MAP-VLA是一个增强预训练视觉-语言-动作模型的新框架，通过演示衍生的记忆提示来解决长时程机器人操作任务中的记忆限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的VLA模型在端到端机器人操作中表现出色，但由于缺乏记忆能力且仅依赖即时感官输入，在处理长时程任务时存在困难。

Method: 首先从历史演示构建记忆库，每个记忆单元捕获任务特定阶段的信息，作为可学习的软提示进行优化；然后在实时任务执行中通过轨迹相似性匹配检索相关记忆，并动态集成到VLA模型中增强动作生成。

Result: 在仿真基准测试中实现高达7.0%的绝对性能提升，在真实机器人评估中达到25.0%的性能提升，超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MAP-VLA作为一个即插即用模块，为冻结的VLA模型提供了轻量级且灵活的解决方案，显著提升了长时程机器人操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in improving robustness and generalization for end-to-end robotic manipulation. However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统评估AI系统在模拟人机交互中引发心理风险的方法，基于18个真实案例开发了2160个模拟场景，测试了4个主流大语言模型，分析了157,054轮对话，识别了心理风险检测的漏洞和15种有害响应模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统日益融入日常生活，其可能加剧或引发严重心理伤害的潜力仍未被充分理解和测试，需要开发系统方法来探索AI交互中的心理风险。

Method: 基于18个真实案例提取有害交互模式，使用临床分期模型构建2160个模拟场景，测试4个主要LLM在多轮对话中的表现，通过回归分析和聚类分析识别风险模式和漏洞。

Result: 发现心理困扰检测存在关键差距，LLM在应对脆弱用户和防止伤害升级方面表现不佳；老年用户风险更高，低收入群体表现相对较好；识别出15种有害响应模式，分为4类AI促成伤害。

Conclusion: 本研究贡献了识别心理风险的新方法、系统常见故障模式的实证证据，以及高风险人机交互中有害AI响应模式的分类体系。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, their potential to exacerbate or trigger severe psychological harms remains poorly understood and inadequately tested. This paper presents a proactive methodology for systematically exploring psychological risks in simulated human-AI interactions based on documented real-world cases involving AI-induced or AI-exacerbated addiction, anorexia, depression, homicide, psychosis, and suicide. We collected and analyzed 18 reported real-world cases where AI interactions contributed to severe psychological outcomes. From these cases, we developed a process to extract harmful interaction patterns and assess potential risks through 2,160 simulated scenarios using clinical staging models. We tested four major LLMs across multi-turn conversations to identify where psychological risks emerge: which harm domains, conversation stages, and contexts reveal system vulnerabilities. Through the analysis of 157,054 simulated conversation turns, we identify critical gaps in detecting psychological distress, responding appropriately to vulnerable users, and preventing harm escalation. Regression analysis reveals variability across persona types: LLMs tend to perform worse with elderly users but better with low- and middle-income groups compared to high-income groups. Clustering analysis of harmful responses reveals a taxonomy of fifteen distinct failure patterns organized into four categories of AI-enabled harm. This work contributes a novel methodology for identifying psychological risks, empirical evidence of common failure modes across systems, and a classification of harmful AI response patterns in high-stakes human-AI interactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型被盲人和低视力人群广泛用于识别日常产品，但缺乏对图像质量问题如何影响模型准确性的实证研究，以及生成的描述是否满足用户信息需求。

Method: 基于对86名盲人和低视力人士的调查，系统评估图像质量问题对视觉语言模型生成描述的影响，测试模型在不同质量图像上的表现。

Result: 最佳模型在无质量问题的图像上产品识别准确率达98%，但当存在图像质量问题时整体准确率降至75%，且随着问题叠加准确率进一步恶化。

Conclusion: 需要以残障人士体验为中心的模型评估方法，并为HCI和ML研究人员提供具体建议，使视觉语言模型对盲人和低视力人群更加可靠。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used by blind and low-vision (BLV) people to identify and understand products in their everyday lives, such as food, personal products, and household goods. Despite their prevalence, we lack an empirical understanding of how common image quality issues, like blur and misframing of items, affect the accuracy of VLM-generated captions and whether resulting captions meet BLV people's information needs. Grounded in a survey with 86 BLV people, we systematically evaluate how image quality issues affect captions generated by VLMs. We show that the best model recognizes products in images with no quality issues with 98% accuracy, but drops to 75% accuracy overall when quality issues are present, worsening considerably as issues compound. We discuss the need for model evaluations that center on disabled people's experiences throughout the process and offer concrete recommendations for HCI and ML researchers to make VLMs more reliable for BLV people.

Result: 显著降低乘客晕车程度，但由于视觉内容分散注意力，未直接提高IVIS使用效率。

Conclusion: 为未来自动驾驶车辆中更智能、用户友好的IVIS设计提供了重要理论支持和实践指导。

Abstract: The problem of Motion Sickness (MS) among passengers significantly impacts the comfort and efficiency of In-Vehicle Infotainment Systems (IVIS) use. In this study, we innovatively designed SimPath, a visual design to effectively mitigate passengers' MS and boost their efficiency of using IVIS during driving. The study focuses on the problem of irregular motion conditions frequently encountered during actual driving. To validate the efficacy of this approach, two sets of real - vehicle experiments were carried out in real driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces passenger's MS level to a certain extent. However, due to divided attention from visual content, it does not directly improve the IVIS efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers crucial insights for the design of a more intelligent and user friendly IVIS, based on the discussion of the principle, providing strong theoretical support and practical guidance for the development of future IVIS in autonomous vehicles.

Motivation: 电子健康记录数据是医疗机器学习的重要数据源，但研究人员和临床医生在提取和验证数据时面临表达性和可用性之间的权衡，现有工具通常只支持单一数据标准，难以编写适应现代建模流程的时间查询。

Method: 开发TempoQL工具包，提供简单的人类可读时间查询语言，支持OMOP、MEDS等多种EHR数据标准，并集成交互式笔记本界面和大型语言模型辅助编写功能。

Result: 通过性能评估和两个不同数据集的使用案例，证明TempoQL在保持精度、速度和可重复性的同时，简化了机器学习队列的创建过程。

Conclusion: TempoQL成功降低了EHR数据提取和验证的门槛，为医疗机器学习研究提供了更易用和灵活的工具。

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) data is an essential data source for machine learning for health, but researchers and clinicians face steep barriers in extracting and validating EHR data for modeling. Existing tools incur trade-offs between expressivity and usability and are typically specialized to a single data standard, making it difficult to write temporal queries that are ready for modern model-building pipelines and adaptable to new datasets. This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance. Through a performance evaluation and two use cases on different datasets, we demonstrate that TempoQL simplifies the creation of cohorts for machine learning while maintaining precision, speed, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shown promise in medical imaging, yet most existing systems lack flexibility, interpretability, and adaptability - challenges especially pronounced in ophthalmology, where diverse imaging modalities are essential. We present EyeAgent, the first agentic AI framework for comprehensive and interpretable clinical decision support in ophthalmology. Using a large language model (DeepSeek-V3) as its central reasoning engine, EyeAgent interprets user queries and dynamically orchestrates 53 validated ophthalmic tools across 23 imaging modalities for diverse tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, image/report generation, and quantitative analysis. Stepwise ablation analysis demonstrated a progressive improvement in diagnostic accuracy, rising from a baseline of 69.71% (using only 5 general tools) to 80.79% when the full suite of 53 specialized tools was integrated. In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists. These findings establish EyeAgent as a scalable and trustworthy AI framework for ophthalmology and provide a blueprint for modular, multimodal, and clinically aligned next-generation AI systems.

TL;DR: 算法建议在竞争性决策中作为战略信号，影响市场动态。研究发现个性化算法建议比集体建议影响更强，可能导致隐性合谋和超竞争利润。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究算法建议如何影响人类在经典经济博弈中的行为，探讨算法在竞争环境中作为战略协调信号的作用。

Method: 两个预注册实验：实验1使用伯特兰价格竞争，实验2使用古诺数量竞争，分别测试个体化和集体化算法建议的影响。

Result: 实验1中，合谋性向上偏见的建议提高了价格，但价格逐渐向均衡收敛；实验2中，合谋性向下偏见的建议导致持续低产和超竞争利润。个性化建议比集体建议影响更强。

Conclusion: 算法建议可作为战略信号促进协调，即使没有明确沟通。结果呼应了现实世界对算法合谋的担忧，强调在竞争环境中需要谨慎设计和监督算法决策支持系统。

Abstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.

Conclusion: 未来学习工具的设计不应仅仅关注丰富互动，而应利用学生的表达能力来构建支持生产性认知工作的系统。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the user interface for learning, moving from keyword search to natural language dialogue, their impact on educational outcomes remains unclear. We present a controlled study (N=20) that directly compares the learning interaction and outcomes between LLM and search-based interfaces. We found that although LLMs elicit richer and nuanced interactions from a learner, they do not produce broadly better learning outcomes. In this paper, we explore this the ``Interaction-Outcome Paradox.'' To explain this, we discuss the concept of a cognitive shift: the locus of student effort moves from finding and synthesizing disparate sources (search) to a more self-aware identification and articulation of their knowledge gaps and strategies to bridge those gaps (LLMs). This insight provides a new lens for evaluating educational technologies, suggesting that the future of learning tools lies not in simply enriching interaction, but in designing systems that scaffold productive cognitive work by leveraging this student expressiveness.

Abstract: This paper proposes an energy-workload coupled migration optimization strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) with data centers (DCs) to enhance resource scheduling flexibility and achieve precise demand response (DR) curve tracking. A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions. Simulations based on real data from Google's multiple DCs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving DR curve tracking precision and reducing operational costs.

Abstract: This work presents a global-to-local, task-aware fault detection and identification (FDI) framework for multi-spacecraft systems conducting collaborative inspection missions in low Earth orbit. The inspection task is represented by a global information-driven cost functional that integrates the sensor model, spacecraft poses, and mission-level information-gain objectives. This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators. An adaptive thresholding mechanism captures the time-varying inspection geometry and dynamic mission conditions. Simulation results for representative multi-spacecraft inspection scenarios demonstrate the reliability of fault localization and classification under uncertainty, providing a unified, information-driven foundation for resilient autonomous inspection architectures.

Abstract: Successive convex programming (SCP) is a powerful class of direct optimization methods, known for its polynomial complexity and computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for autonomous applications. Direct methods are also referred to as ``discretize-then-optimize'' with discretization being a fundamental solution step. A key step in all practical direct methods is mesh refinement, which aims to refine the solution resolution by enhancing the precision and quality of discretization techniques through strategic distribution and placement of mesh/grid points. We propose a novel method to enhance adaptive mesh refinement stability by integrating it with a nonlinearity-index-based trust-region strategy within the SCP framework for spacecraft trajectory design. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through solving minimum-fuel, low-thrust missions, including a benchmark Earth-to-Asteroid rendezvous and an Earth-Moon L2 Halo-to-Halo transfer using the Circular Restricted Three-Body (CR3BP) model.

Abstract: With the explosive advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security of efficient UAV networks has become increasingly critical. Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that connects sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and the iterative linear-parameter-varying model predictive control (LPV-MPC) technique. Using the differential formulation of the LPV-MPC, we demonstrate how SQP and LPV-MPC can be unified through a specific choice of scheduling variable and the 2nd Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) embedding technique and compare their convergence properties. This enables the unification of the zero-order approach of SQP with the LPV-MPC scheduling technique to enhance the computational efficiency of stochastic and robust MPC problems. To demonstrate our findings, we compare the two schemes in a simulation example. Finally, we present real-time feasibility and performance of the zeroorder LPV-MPC approach by applying it to Gaussian process (GP)-based MPC for autonomous racing with real-world experiments.

Abstract: The operational lifetime of energy-harvesting wireless sensor nodes is limited by availability of the energy source and the capacity of the installed energy buffer. When a sensor node depletes its energy reserves, manual intervention is often required to resume node operation. While lowering the duty cycle would help extend the network lifetime, this is often undesirable, especially in time-critical applications, where rapid collection and dissemination of information is vital. In this paper, we propose a context-aware energy management policy that helps balance the two opposing objectives of timely data collection and dissemination with energy conservation. We capture these objectives through the Value of Information (VoI) of observations made by a sensor node and the State of Energy (SoE) of the energy buffer. We formulate the energy management policy as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem which computes device sampling and transmission frequencies to maximize a defined utility criterion over a finite, receding, time-horizon. In the process, we also develop a unique mathematical representation for VoI, that adequately captures aspects related to continuity in monitoring, urgency of dissemination, and representation of the phenomena being observed. In the end, we use data collected from a real-world flash flood event, to evaluate our decision framework across multiple scenarios of energy availability.

Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems have emerged as fundamental models across numerous application domains, providing powerful mathematical representations for capturing uncertain system behavior. In this paper, we address the problem of runtime safety and reach-avoid probability prediction for discrete-time stochastic systems with online observations, i.e., estimating the probability that the system satisfies a given safety or reach-avoid specification. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on offline models, we propose a framework that incorporates real-time observations to dynamically refine probability estimates for safety and reach-avoid events. By introducing observation-aware barrier functions, our method adaptively updates probability bounds as new observations are collected, combining efficient offline computation with online backward iteration. This approach enables rigorous and responsive prediction of safety and reach-avoid probabilities under uncertainty. In addition to the theoretical guarantees, experimental results on benchmark systems demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We propose decentralized k-hop Prescribed Performance State and Input Observers for heterogeneous multi-agent systems subject to bounded external disturbances. In the proposed input/state observer, each agent estimates the state and input of agents located two or more hops away using only local information exchanged with 1-hop neighbors, while guaranteeing that transient estimation errors satisfy predefined performance bounds. Conditions are established under which the input observer can be omitted, allowing the state observer convergence to be independent of the input estimates. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that if a closed-loop controller with full state knowledge achieves the control objective and the estimation-based closed-loop system is set-Input to State Stable (set-ISS) with respect to the goal set, then the estimated states can be used to achieve the system objective with an arbitrarily small worst-case error governed by the accuracy of the states estimates. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed approach.

Abstract: The concept of a security index quantifies the minimum number of components that must be compromised to carry out an undetectable attack. This metric enables system operators to quantify each component's security risk and implement countermeasures. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven security index that can be computed solely from input/output data when the system model is unknown. We show a sufficient condition under which the data-driven security index coincides with the model-based security index, which implies that the exact risk level of each component can be identified solely from the data. We provide an algorithm for computing the data-driven security index. Although computing this index is NP-hard, we derive a polynomial-time computable upper bound. Numerical examples on vehicle platooning illustrate the efficacy and limitations of the proposed index and algorithms.

Conclusion: 该方法为曲率感知的SDF学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.

Abstract: Designing freeform surfaces to control light based on real-world illumination patterns is challenging, as existing caustic lens designs often assume oversimplified point or parallel light sources. We propose representing surface light sources using an optimized set of point sources, whose parameters are fitted to the real light source's illumination using a novel differentiable rendering framework. Our physically-based rendering approach simulates light transmission using flux, without requiring prior knowledge of the light source's intensity distribution. To efficiently explore the light source parameter space during optimization, we apply a contraction mapping that converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Using the optimized light source model, we then design the freeform lens shape considering flux consistency and normal integrability. Simulations and physical experiments show our method more accurately represents real surface light sources compared to point-source approximations, yielding caustic lenses that produce images closely matching the target light distributions.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling complex interactions among autonomous entities in distributed environments. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), communication enables coordination but can lead to inefficient information exchange, since agents may generate redundant or non-essential messages. While prior work has focused on boosting task performance with information exchange, the existing research lacks a thorough investigation of both the appropriate definition and the optimization of communication protocols (communication topology and message). To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our learned communication protocol can significantly enhance communication efficiency and achieves better cooperation performance with improved success rates.

Abstract: We consider a scenario where a team of two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pursue an evader UAV within an urban environment. Each agent has a limited view of their environment where buildings can occlude their field-of-view. Additionally, the pursuer team is agnostic about the evader in terms of its initial and final location, and the behavior of the evader. Consequently, the team needs to gather information by searching the environment and then track it to eventually intercept. To solve this multi-player, partially-observable, pursuit-evasion game, we develop a two-phase neuro-symbolic algorithm centered around the principle of bounded rationality. First, we devise an offline approach using deep reinforcement learning to progressively train adversarial policies for the pursuer team against fictitious evaders. This creates $k$-levels of rationality for each agent in preparation for the online phase. Then, we employ an online classification algorithm to determine a "best guess" of our current opponent from the set of iteratively-trained strategic agents and apply the best player response. Using this schema, we improved average performance when facing a random evader in our environment.
