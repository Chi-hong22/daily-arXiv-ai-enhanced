### [1] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO是首个基于视频一致性模型的零样本高分辨率视频恢复方法，通过利用VCM先验实现时空一致的视频重建，在计算效率和重建质量上均优于逐帧应用图像LDM的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像扩散模型的零样本逆求解器在视频恢复中面临挑战，逐帧应用会导致时间不一致性。需要开发能够同时恢复空间细节和捕捉时间依赖性的视频恢复方法。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)作为先验，提出LVTINO零样本逆求解器。通过条件机制绕过自动微分需求，仅需少量神经网络评估即可实现测量一致性和平滑时间过渡。

Result: 在多种视频逆问题上的实验表明，相比逐帧应用图像LDM的现有方法，LVTINO在感知质量上有显著提升，在重建保真度和计算效率方面均达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: LVTINO成功将VCM先验应用于视频恢复，解决了时间一致性问题，为高分辨率视频逆问题提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于风格提取的三阶段训练图像生成方法，通过风格编码器和投影层将风格表示与文本表示对齐，实现细粒度文本引导的风格化图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型中细粒度风格难以用自然语言精确描述和控制的问题，以及风格参考图像的引导信息难以与文本条件直接对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用风格编码器和风格投影层提取单张风格参考图像的细粒度风格表示，在不改变下游生成模型结构框架的情况下注入风格表示，实现三阶段训练方法。

Result: 构建了包含图像、风格标签和文本描述三元组的Style30k-captions数据集，用于训练风格编码器和风格投影层。

Conclusion: 该方法能够最大化预训练生成模型的生成能力，实现细粒度控制的风格化图像生成。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究收集了一个包含61.68小时视频、2,793个视频和5,385个标注时间片段的挣扎识别数据集，用于分析技能学习过程中的挣扎演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操作数据集未关注挣扎随时间演变的过程，而理解这种演变对于确定用户当前学习阶段和开发有效辅助系统至关重要。

Method: 收集了76名参与者在18个任务中的重复执行数据，将挣扎识别定义为时间动作定位任务，使用Temporal Action Localization模型进行检测。

Result: 模型在跨任务评估中获得34.56%的平均mAP，跨活动评估中获得19.24%的平均mAP，表明挣扎概念在不同技能任务间具有可迁移性。

Conclusion: 挣扎是一个可跨任务迁移的概念，但挣扎检测仍需进一步改进，数据集为研究技能学习过程中的挣扎演变提供了基础。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

### [4] [SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370)
*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS是一个紧凑高效的偏微分方程求解基础模型，使用轻量级残差U-Net架构，通过自回归预训练策略学习物理规律，在多种PDE任务上实现最先进的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要基于大型复杂transformer架构，计算和参数开销高。作者希望开发一个更紧凑高效的统一神经算子来解决广泛的偏微分方程。

Method: 采用轻量级残差U-Net架构，使用自回归预训练策略模拟数值求解器行为来学习底层物理规律，在流体动力学PDE数据集上进行预训练。

Result: SPUS在6个未见过的下游PDE任务上实现了最先进的泛化性能，同时需要显著更少的参数和极少的微调数据。

Conclusion: SPUS展示了作为高度参数高效的PDE求解基础模型的潜力，残差U-Net架构在这一领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过多样性约束直接优化多人生成中的身份多样性，解决了文本到图像模型在多人提示下重复面孔、合并身份和计数错误的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像模型在现实主义方面表现出色，但在处理多人生成提示时会出现问题，包括重复面孔、合并身份和错误计数个体。

Method: DisCo通过组相对策略优化(GRPO)微调流匹配模型，使用组合奖励函数：(i)惩罚图像内面部相似性，(ii)阻止跨样本身份重复，(iii)强制执行准确的人员计数，(iv)通过人类偏好分数保持视觉保真度。单阶段课程稳定训练复杂度扩展，无需额外标注。

Result: 在DiverseHumans测试集上，DisCo实现了98.6%的唯一面孔准确率和接近完美的全局身份分布，超越了开源和专有方法（如Gemini、GPT-Image），同时保持了有竞争力的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo作为一个可扩展、无需标注的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机问题，并为组合多人生成设立了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

### [6] [GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448)
*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉地理定位方法，通过将查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示对齐，使用层次化地理嵌入模型，并结合外观特征和语义分割图形成鲁棒的视觉表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球视觉地理定位问题，即仅使用图像视觉内容确定其在地球上的地理位置。现有方法在地理表示学习方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 将地理定位建模为对齐查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示，使用层次化地理嵌入模型表示世界，并高效融合图像外观特征和语义分割图。

Result: 在5个基准数据集的25个指标中，22个指标达到了新的最佳性能，超越了现有最先进方法和大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 性能提升主要归功于地理表示和视觉表示的结合，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了XMAS方法，通过分析跨模态注意力矩阵的轨迹来聚类训练样本，有效消除LVLM训练数据中的冗余，能在保留50%-85%数据的同时完全保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)上表现不佳，甚至无法超越随机选择，需要开发专门针对LVLMs的高效数据选择方法。

Method: 基于跨模态注意力矩阵相似性的理论分析，提出XMAS方法：通过聚类注意力矩阵的top奇异值轨迹，从聚类中平衡采样构建训练子集。

Result: 在LLaVA-665k数据集上可丢弃50%数据，在Vision-Flan数据集上可丢弃85%数据，同时完全保持LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游任务上的性能，训练速度提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: XMAS是首个针对LVLMs的高效数据选择方法，能显著减少训练数据冗余，在保持性能的同时加速训练过程。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

### [8] [Purrception: Variational Flow Matching for Vector-Quantized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01478)
*Răzvan-Andrei Matişan,Vincent Tao Hu,Grigory Bartosh,Björn Ommer,Cees G. M. Snoek,Max Welling,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Floor Eijkelboom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception是一种用于向量量化图像生成的变分流匹配方法，结合了连续传输动态和离散分类监督，在ImageNet-1k 256x256图像生成上实现了更快的训练收敛和竞争力的FID分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的向量量化图像生成方法在连续传输动态和离散监督之间存在权衡，Purrception旨在结合连续方法的几何感知能力和离散方法的分类监督优势。

Method: 通过将变分流匹配适配到向量量化潜在空间，在连续嵌入空间中学习速度场，同时学习码书索引的分类后验分布。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务上，训练收敛速度比连续流匹配和离散流匹配基线更快，同时达到了与最先进模型竞争的FID分数。

Conclusion: 变分流匹配能够有效桥接连续传输和离散监督，提升图像生成的训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

### [9] [AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498)
*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的深度学习框架，从非对比CT扫描生成合成对比增强CT图像，同时分割主动脉腔和血栓，通过条件扩散模型和多任务学习实现端到端联合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比增强CT需要碘对比剂，存在肾毒性、过敏反应和环境危害等风险。现有方法采用多阶段流程，导致误差累积且无法利用共享语义和解剖结构。

Method: 集成条件扩散模型与多任务学习，共享编码器和解码器参数，采用半监督训练策略处理缺失分割标签的临床数据，无需初始预测。

Result: 在264名患者队列中表现优于现有方法：图像合成PSNR达25.61 dB，腔分割Dice得分0.89，血栓分割Dice得分0.53，腔直径MAE降至4.19 mm，血栓面积误差降至33.85%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化图像合成和分割任务，显著提升了合成图像质量和分割精度，为减少对比剂使用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多模态内容分析的高效原型框架，将视频转换为时序半结构化数据，并进一步转换为可查询的知识图谱表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容分析通常计算成本高且工程复杂，现有预训练模型难以与视频等复杂数据融合，需要简化原型开发流程。

Method: 设计候选流程配方，结合预训练模型将视频转换为时序半结构化数据，再转换为帧级索引的知识图谱表示。

Result: 实现了可查询的知识图谱表示，支持持续学习，能够通过交互方式动态整合新的领域特定知识。

Conclusion: 该框架有效简化了多模态内容分析的原型开发，提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT框架通过逆向工程将网站功能转化为可重用的工具，让Web代理直接调用高层操作（如搜索、过滤、排序），而不是依赖脆弱的逐步UI交互，从而在浏览器自动化中实现更高的成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Web代理方法依赖逐步UI交互和大量LLM推理，在动态布局和长任务中容易失败。相比之下，人类利用网站提供的高层功能（如搜索、过滤、排序）更高效可靠。

Method: WALT框架逆向工程网站的潜在功能，将其转化为可调用的工具，涵盖发现（搜索、过滤、排序）、通信（发布、评论、点赞）和内容管理（创建、编辑、删除）等操作。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena测试中，WALT实现了更高的成功率，使用更少的步骤和更少的LLM依赖推理。

Conclusion: WALT建立了一个稳健且可推广的浏览器自动化范式，将计算负担从脆弱的逐步推理转移到可靠的工具调用。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

*Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Shahira Abousamra,Chen Li,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于半监督分割的拓扑一致性框架，通过整合空间重叠和全局结构对齐来匹配跨预测的拓扑特征，减少拓扑错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督分割中，从未标记数据中捕获有意义的语义结构至关重要，特别是在组织病理学图像分析中，对象密集分布，这带来了挑战。

Method: 利用通过随机dropout和时间训练快照获得的多个扰动预测，强制这些不同输出之间的拓扑一致性，并引入一种结合空间重叠和全局结构对齐的新匹配策略。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该方法有效减少了拓扑错误，产生了更稳健和准确的分割结果。

Conclusion: 该方法对于可靠的下游分析至关重要，能够更有效地识别和保留相关的拓扑特征。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了Diffusion-LPO框架，通过列表偏好优化来改进文本到图像扩散模型的对齐效果，相比成对偏好方法能更好地利用人类反馈中的排序信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DPO的方法主要依赖成对偏好，但人类对图像的偏好反馈通常包含隐式的排序信息，这些信息比成对比较能更精确地表达人类偏好。

Method: 提出Diffusion-LPO框架，将用户反馈聚合成图像排名列表，在Plackett-Luce模型下推导DPO目标的列表扩展，通过鼓励每个样本优于其所有低排名替代品来保持整个排名的一致性。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中，Diffusion-LPO在视觉质量和偏好对齐方面持续优于成对DPO基线方法。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO是一个简单有效的列表偏好优化框架，能够更好地利用人类反馈中的排序信息来改进扩散模型的对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

Conclusion: Bridge证明了纯自回归方法可以在单一框架中有效统一多模态理解和生成，同时保持高质量输出和训练效率。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，用于小数据集下的口腔癌分类，通过变分推理进行不确定性量化，在真实世界数据上表现出更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔癌是全球高发癌症，早期诊断对降低死亡率至关重要。传统深度学习模型在数据稀缺环境下存在过度自信和泛化能力差的问题，需要解决小数据集下的可靠分类。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络与贝叶斯深度学习相结合的混合模型，采用变分推理进行不确定性量化，在智能手机拍摄的彩色图像上进行训练。

Result: 在训练数据分布相似的测试集上达到94%准确率，与传统CNN相当；在真实世界图像数据上达到88%准确率，显著优于传统CNN的72.94%。模型对正确分类样本表现出高置信度，对错误分类样本表现出低置信度。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推理在数据稀缺环境中能有效提高模型可靠性和泛化能力，有助于改善口腔癌早期诊断。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出CADTrans方法解决无源域自适应问题，通过构建辅助域和一致性策略获得不变特征表示，使用条件多核最大均值差异对齐困难样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无法直接访问源域数据，现有方法难以获得确定性的不变特征，且容易受到困难样本和域偏差的影响。

Method: 构建辅助域模块获取多样化表示，通过多个一致性策略获得不变特征表示，使用条件多核最大均值差异策略对齐困难样本。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VISDA-C和DomainNet-126等基准测试上取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: CADTrans方法通过构建域一致性的不变特征表示，有效解决了无源域自适应中的困难样本和域偏差问题。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于历史BLV用户问题的系统，通过识别相似视觉上下文来指导MLLM生成更相关的描述，相比无上下文描述能更好地回答用户问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在为盲人和低视力用户提供视觉解释时，往往提供冗长且不相关的描述，导致信息交换效率低下。

Method: 利用VizWiz-LF数据集中的历史BLV用户问题，当给定图像时识别相似视觉上下文，并用相关问题指导MLLM生成描述。

Result: 评估显示上下文感知描述在76.1%的情况下能预判并回答用户问题，在54.4%的比较中被优先选择。

Conclusion: 基于历史用户问题的上下文感知方法能显著提高MLLM为BLV用户生成描述的针对性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在解决图像逆问题时通常忽略感知矩阵零空间的任务特定结构，导致重建效果受限。

Method: 使用神经网络构建感知矩阵零空间的低维投影，将解约束在该投影空间中，而不是直接在图像域施加正则化。

Result: 在压缩感知、去模糊、超分辨率、CT和MRI等多种逆问题中，NPN方法能持续提升重建保真度，并与现有重建框架兼容。

Conclusion: NPN方法通过关注零空间结构提供了可解释且灵活的正则化，能有效提升各种成像逆问题的重建质量。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: 该工作为基因组医学中的机器人和临床自动化建立了可靠的基础，弥合了可解释基因组建模与自动化决策之间的差距。

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型缺乏显式的逐步推理，不考虑功能约束和几何关系，后训练流程也很少强化推理质量。

Method: 集成验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)和组相对策略优化(GRPO)，设计基于RLVR的后训练策略，创建VLA-CoT-13K高质量数据集提供思维链监督。

Result: 在领域内、领域外、仿真和真实机器人平台上的广泛评估显示，VLA-R1相比现有VLA方法具有更优的泛化性和真实世界性能。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过系统优化推理和执行，显著提升了VLA模型的推理鲁棒性和执行准确性，计划发布模型、代码和数据集。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距摄影具有高分辨率和大放大倍率的优势，但散焦模糊严重阻碍了清晰成像和高质量3D重建。传统方法需要大量图像和标注，且目前没有针对微距摄影的多视角3D重建方法。

Method: 从多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰3D模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核。整个框架采用可微分渲染方法，自监督优化3D模型和散焦模糊核。

Result: 大量实验表明，从少量多视角图像出发，该方法不仅能实现高质量图像去模糊，还能恢复高保真度的3D外观。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，实现了联合去模糊和3D重建，为小物体的高质量3D建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Conclusion: FideDiff为预训练扩散模型在高保真图像恢复任务中的应用提供了新方向，为工业应用建立了稳健的基准。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青铜器铭文是早期中国文字的重要阶段，但由于严重的视觉退化、多领域变异性（照片、拓片、摹本）和极长的字符分布，自动识别仍然困难。

Method: 构建大规模青铜器铭文数据集，开发两阶段检测-识别流程，使用LadderMoE增强CLIP编码器，通过梯级MoE适配器实现动态专家专业化和更强的鲁棒性。

Result: 在单字符和全页识别任务上，该方法显著优于最先进的场景文本识别基线，在头部、中部和尾部类别以及所有采集模式上都取得了优越的准确率。

Conclusion: 为青铜器铭文识别和下游考古分析建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

TL;DR: 提出VirDA方法，通过视觉重编程层生成视觉提示来适应目标域风格，无需微调主干网络参数，实现参数高效的领域自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA方法需要为每个新的源-目标对微调主干网络参数，导致训练参数和存储内存线性增长，且无法复用训练好的主干参数。

Method: 在主干网络前添加领域特定的视觉重编程层，生成视觉提示作为纹理偏置来调整输入图像的风格。使用多目标函数优化领域内和领域间分布差异，保持主干参数不变。

Result: 在Office-31数据集上达到92.8%平均准确率，仅需1.5M可训练参数。相比PDA方法准确率提升1.6%，参数减少54%；相比全主干微调方法，准确率相当但参数仅需1.7%-2.8%。

Conclusion: VirDA通过视觉重编程实现了参数高效的领域自适应，显著减少了训练参数需求，同时保持了竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Motivation: 现有基于条件扩散模型的姿态估计方法泛化能力差，主要因为位置测量受用户体型影响大，需要解决跨用户泛化问题。

Method: 将姿态估计建模为逆问题，使用预训练扩散模型仅基于旋转测量进行条件生成，通过从测量位置导出的似然项引导先验。

Result: InPose方法能够生成高度可能的姿态序列，准确解释稀疏的身体测量数据。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限传感器设置下实现了零样本泛化的姿态估计，解决了跨用户泛化问题。

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroSwift通过整合AutoKL和CLIP适配器的扩散模型，实现从fMRI数据中跨被试重建视觉刺激，仅需微调17%参数即可在新被试上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从脑活动中重建视觉信息时面临的跨被试差异大、计算成本高的问题，以及大脑对复杂视觉输入的抽象语义编码挑战。

Method: 提出NeuroSwift框架，整合AutoKL适配器提取低级特征和CLIP适配器模拟高级视觉皮层语义编码。采用预训练加微调策略，仅微调全连接层参数（17%）。

Result: 在轻量级GPU（3个RTX 4090）上仅需1小时训练即可达到最先进性能，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: NeuroSwift通过高效的参数微调和互补适配器设计，成功解决了跨被试视觉重建的挑战，为神经解码提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Con-NRSfM的新方法，用于处理共形变形下的非刚性结构恢复问题，能够准确计算局部共形尺度，并通过自监督学习框架生成带纹理的密集3D点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目视觉可变形SLAM中的映射挑战，现有方法依赖严格假设（如局部平面表面或局部线性变形）且无法恢复共形尺度，需要消除这些约束并实现更精确的深度估计。

Method: 使用基于图的框架优化2D选定图像扭曲来进行逐点重建，采用并行可分离迭代优化策略，并整合自监督学习的编码器-解码器网络来生成密集3D点云。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的仿真和实验结果表明，该方法在重建精度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Con-NRSfM方法成功解决了共形变形下的NRSfM问题，消除了现有方法的限制，实现了更准确的深度估计和局部共形尺度计算。

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集观测来优化模型参数，难以处理图像不一致的3D场景重建问题。

Method: 首先将不一致图像转换为初始视频，然后使用专门设计的视频扩散模型将其修复为一致图像，最后从修复后的图像重建3D场景。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在鲁棒重建方面具有强大的泛化能力和优越性能。

Conclusion: UniVerse不仅能够实现鲁棒的3D重建，还能控制重建3D场景的风格，为处理图像不一致问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级端到端模板匹配框架，将模板匹配重新定义为联合定位和几何回归，输出中心坐标、旋转角度和独立缩放比例，在复合变换下实现高精度和快速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要穷举角度和尺度导致效率低下，而深度学习方法仅估计相似度得分而不显式建模几何姿态，无法满足实际部署需求。

Method: 使用模板感知动态卷积模块动态注入模板特征，结合深度可分离卷积和像素重排实现高效匹配，采用旋转-剪切增强策略进行无几何标注训练，并通过轻量级优化模块提升角度和尺度精度。

Result: 3.07M参数模型在复合变换下达到高精度和14ms推理速度，在小模板和多目标场景中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法非常适合实时工业应用部署，在模板匹配任务中实现了效率与精度的平衡。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个自适应像素推理框架，让VLM能根据查询难度动态决定是否需要像素级操作，在提升性能的同时大幅减少不必要的视觉操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在处理需要精细视觉元素理解的任务时表现不佳，主要由于图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域关注不足。虽然引入像素级信息有帮助，但往往被过度使用，导致效率低下和无关细节干扰。

Method: 首先通过操作感知的监督微调建立文本推理和视觉操作的基础能力，然后设计基于模型自身响应反馈的rollout引导强化学习框架，让VLM能根据查询难度自适应决定何时调用像素操作。

Result: 在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中，模型在HR-Bench 4K上达到73.4%准确率，同时工具使用率仅为20.1%，相比先前方法在提升准确率的同时减少了66.5%的工具使用。

Conclusion: 该自适应像素推理框架能有效平衡性能与效率，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低计算开销，为VLM的精细视觉理解任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光片解读中存在公平性和可靠性问题，模型在不同患者亚组中表现不均，现有错误检测方法难以处理分布内的细微错误。

Method: 使用临床合理的旋转增强（±15°/±30°），通过RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入变化，基于敏感性评分将样本分层为稳定性四分位数。

Result: 高度敏感的病例显示出显著较低的召回率（-0.2至-0.3），尽管具有高AUROC和置信度，ASRS能够无标签地实现选择性预测。

Conclusion: ASRS提供了一种无需标签的方法用于选择性预测和临床医生审查，改善了医疗AI的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频风格化方法存在时间一致性差、风格丰富度低的问题，而训练专用模型需要配对视频数据且计算成本高。

Method: 整合多个风格化参考到预训练I2V模型，使用高频补偿约束内容布局和运动，结合基于光流的运动线索保留低显著性区域的风格纹理。

Result: FreeViS在风格化保真度和时间一致性方面优于现有基线方法，获得强烈的人类偏好。

Conclusion: 该无需训练的方法为高质量、时间一致性的视频风格化提供了实用且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法受限于标量评分指标，无法反映专家评估中的人类推理过程，需要建立更符合人类推理的语言评估范式。

Method: 定义两个互补任务：MedQ-Perception（低层感知能力）和MedQ-Reasoning（无参考和比较推理任务），采用多维度评判协议评估模型输出，并与放射科医生进行人机对齐验证。

Result: 评估14个最先进MLLM显示模型具备初步但不稳定的感知和推理技能，临床使用准确性不足，需要针对性优化。

Conclusion: MedQ-Bench将促进MLLM在医学图像质量评估中的进一步探索，释放其未开发潜力。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在受控环境中理解实例级几何仍然具有挑战性，现有方法需要昂贵的输入格式（类别标签、二值分割掩码）和二次推理成本。

Method: InstaFormer通过对象查询与潜在掩码描述符之间的交互来实现整体顺序预测，这些描述符语义上表示相同对象但携带互补信息。

Result: 通过全面基准测试和消融研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: InstaFormer能够仅通过单次前向传播从RGB图像中预测完整的遮挡和深度顺序，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN和Transformer模型在处理复杂风格和高分辨率输入时存在效率问题，需要更高效的神经风格迁移方法。

Method: 提出PyramidStyler框架，包含金字塔位置编码（PPE）来捕获多尺度特征，并结合强化学习动态优化风格化过程。

Result: 在4000轮训练后，内容损失降低62.6%至2.07，风格损失降低57.4%至0.86，推理时间1.39秒；使用RL后内容损失2.03，风格损失0.75，推理时间1.40秒。

Conclusion: PyramidStyler实现了实时高质量的艺术渲染，在媒体和设计领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分治法在扩展3DGS到大规模无边界场景时存在负载严重不平衡和粗到细流水线效率低下的瓶颈。

Method: 引入深度感知分区方法减少预处理时间，基于优化的策略平衡可见高斯分布，以及可见性裁剪和选择性致密化两种轻量级技术。

Conclusion: LoBE-GS能够扩展到传统3DGS无法处理的场景，为大规模3D场景重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

TL;DR: 提出MemoryPack和Direct Forcing两种方法，分别解决长视频生成中的长程依赖建模和自回归解码错误累积问题，提升分钟级时间一致性和推理可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临双重挑战：需要捕获长程依赖关系，同时防止自回归解码中的错误累积。

Method: 1. MemoryPack：可学习的上下文检索机制，利用文本和图像信息作为全局指导，联合建模短长期依赖；2. Direct Forcing：高效单步近似策略，改善训练-推理对齐，减少推理时错误传播。

Result: MemoryPack实现了分钟级时间一致性，具有线性复杂度；Direct Forcing有效抑制了错误累积。两种方法共同提升了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: MemoryPack和Direct Forcing显著增强了自回归视频模型的上下文一致性和可靠性，推进了长视频生成的实际可用性。

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Result: 结合完整类预测校准损失项和等渗回归的方法在CenterPoint和PillarNet上实现了最佳校准效果，但DSVT-Pillar无法使用相同方法同时校准主导和次要预测。

Conclusion: 完整预测向量校准损失项与等渗回归结合能有效改善3D目标检测器的置信度校准，但不同检测器架构的校准特性存在差异。

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Method: 提出DiffPS框架，利用预训练扩散模型，包含三个专门模块：扩散引导区域提议网络(DGRPN)用于增强人员定位，多尺度频率细化网络(MSFRN)减轻形状偏差，语义自适应特征聚合网络(SFAN)利用文本对齐的扩散特征。

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DiffPS通过利用扩散先验知识有效解决了人员搜索中检测和重识别任务的优化冲突问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

### [42] [Flow-Matching Guided Deep Unfolding for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01912)
*Yi Ai,Yuanhao Cai,Yulun Zhang,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding网络（FMU），首次将流匹配集成到高光谱图像重建中，通过深度展开框架嵌入生成先验，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像成本高且重建困难，现有压缩感知系统如CASSI在重建精度上面临严重退化问题，难以保留精细光谱细节。

Method: 将流匹配的生成先验嵌入深度展开框架，引入平均速度损失来增强学习动态的全局一致性，结合基于优化方法的可解释性和流匹配的生成能力。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，FMU在重建质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMU成功地将流匹配与深度展开框架结合，为高光谱图像重建提供了更鲁棒和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的双列直插封装自动缺陷检测系统，使用ConSinGAN生成训练数据，YOLOv7模型在准确率和检测时间上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业组件缺陷检测耗时耗力，给质检人员带来沉重负担且难以管理产品质量。

Method: 使用数字相机光学和深度学习模型，采用ConSinGAN生成合适大小的数据集，比较四种YOLO模型（v3、v4、v7、v9）的性能。

Result: YOLOv7结合ConSinGAN在准确率（95.50%）和检测时间（285毫秒）上表现最优，远优于基于阈值的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动缺陷检测系统可轻松应用于多种缺陷类型或缺陷数据不足的情况，并开发了SCADA系统和相关传感器架构。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundAD是一个基于基础视觉编码器的少样本异常检测方法，通过学习非线性投影算子来识别图像中的异常区域，在参数更少的情况下实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本异常检测在工业安全检查中很重要，但有限样本使得区分正常和异常特征具有挑战性，特别是在类别不可知条件下。基础视觉编码器的大规模预训练有助于学习正常图像的一般分布。

Method: 通过观察图像中异常数量与学习嵌入差异的相关性，设计FoundAD方法，学习一个非线性投影算子到自然图像流形上，作为识别图像中分布外区域的有效工具。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法支持多类别检测，在使用明显更少参数的情况下达到竞争性性能，并通过多个基础编码器（包括DINOv3）的评估验证。

Conclusion: 这一方法拓宽了基础特征的应用视角，并推动了少样本异常检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClustViT提出了一种用于语义分割的Vision Transformer改进方法，通过可训练的聚类模块合并相似token，并使用再生模块恢复细节，在保持分割精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在实际机器人系统中应用受限，因为其二次注意力复杂度太高。现有的token合并方法适用于分类任务，但不适合密集预测任务如语义分割。

Method: 在ViT骨干网络基础上，添加可训练的聚类模块根据分割掩码的伪聚类指导合并相似token，然后使用再生模块恢复细节信息供下游头使用。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上实现了高达2.18倍的GFLOPs减少和1.64倍的推理加速，同时保持了可比较的分割精度。

Conclusion: ClustViT方法有效解决了ViT在密集预测任务中的计算效率问题，为实际机器人应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: PaDT是一种统一的多模态大语言模型范式，通过视觉参考令牌直接生成文本和多样化视觉输出，解决了现有方法依赖间接表示的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉任务中依赖间接表示（如将坐标生成为文本），限制了性能并阻碍了密集预测任务如分割。需要一种能直接生成视觉输出的方法。

Method: 提出Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT)范式，使用视觉参考令牌(VRTs)从查询图像的视觉补丁嵌入中派生，与LLM输出文本令牌交织。轻量级解码器将LLM输出转换为检测、分割和定位预测。

Result: 在四个视觉感知和理解任务上的实证研究表明，PaDT始终达到最先进的性能，甚至与显著更大的MLLM模型相比也是如此。

Conclusion: PaDT提供了一种统一的方法，使MLLMs能够直接生成文本和多样化视觉输出，在多个视觉任务上实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

TL;DR: 本文构建了'信任金字塔'模型和'三角信任指数'(TTI)，提出可解释AI框架TriAlignXA，通过多目标优化解决农产品电商中的'信任赤字'问题，在分级任务中展现出比基线模型更高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线果蔬电商中由于数字交易无法提供直接感官感知而导致的'信任赤字'问题，突破农产品分级中生物特性、时效性和经济可行性构成的'不可能三角'限制。

Method: 提出'双源验证'的信任金字塔模型，设计可解释AI框架TriAlignXA，包含三个核心引擎：生物自适应引擎、时效优化引擎和经济优化引擎，并通过'预映射机制'将过程数据编码为QR码。

Result: 在分级任务实验中展现出比基线模型显著更高的准确性，实证证据和理论分析验证了框架在解决'不可能三角'方面的平衡能力。

Conclusion: 本研究为构建可信赖的在线农产品生态系统提供了从理论到实践的全面支持，建立了从算法决策到消费者信任的关键路径。

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

TL;DR: 4DGS-Craft是一个一致且交互式的4D高斯溅射编辑框架，通过4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型、多视图网格模块、高斯选择机制和基于LLM的用户意图理解模块，解决了视图、时间一致性和复杂文本指令处理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯溅射编辑方法在视图一致性、时间一致性、非编辑区域保持以及处理复杂文本指令方面仍面临挑战，需要开发更一致和可控的编辑框架。

Method: 1. 引入4D感知InstructPix2Pix模型，结合4D VGGT几何特征；2. 使用多视图网格模块迭代优化多视图输入图像；3. 提出高斯选择机制仅优化编辑区域的Gaussians；4. 设计基于LLM的用户意图理解模块分解复杂指令。

Result: 相比相关工作，该方法实现了更一致和可控的4D场景编辑，能够处理复杂的用户指令并保持编辑质量。

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft框架通过综合运用4D感知编辑模型、一致性保持机制和智能用户交互模块，有效解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的关键挑战，为4D场景编辑提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Pure-Pass（PP）像素级掩码机制，通过识别纯像素并免除其昂贵计算，集成到ATD-light模型中，在保持自适应灵活性的同时实现了更优的超分辨率性能和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级超分辨率方法如CAMixer存在适应性差、掩码粒度粗和空间灵活性不足等局限性，需要更精细的计算优化机制。

Method: 使用固定颜色中心点将像素分类到不同类别，实现像素级的精细掩码，识别纯像素并免除其昂贵计算，集成到ATD-light模型中。

Result: PP-ATD-light在重建质量和参数效率方面优于CAMixer-ATD-light，同时节省了相似的计算量。

Conclusion: Pure-Pass机制通过像素级掩码实现了更精细、空间灵活的计算优化，为轻量级图像超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高颌骨囊肿放射学发现的自动生成准确性，解决传统方法在结构化输出和一致性检查方面的不足。

Method: 构建SLSO框架，包含10步流程：图像输入分析、结构化数据生成、牙号提取和一致性检查、检测到不一致时迭代再生、发现生成及后续重构和一致性验证。

Result: SLSO框架在牙号、牙齿移动和牙根吸收方面分别提高了66.9%、33.3%和28.6%的准确率，成功案例中最多经过5次再生实现一致结构化输出。

Conclusion: SLSO框架能增强阴性发现描述、抑制幻觉、提高牙号识别准确性，但识别跨多牙的广泛病变仍有限制，需要进一步优化以实现实用发现生成系统。

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Conclusion: LiLa-Net通过简化架构实现了高效的点云特征编码，在保持重建精度的同时具备良好的泛化性能，为LiDAR数据处理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

Motivation: 传统野外观察方法范围有限、耗时费力，难以评估跨景观的行为响应，需要可扩展的方法来量化复杂多维行为模式。

Method: 整合无人机视频与机器学习系统，使用目标检测、跟踪和行为分类系统提取行为、社交和空间指标，包括时间预算、行为转换、社交互动等。

Conclusion: kabr-tools实现了规模化自动行为监测，为生态系统研究、保护和生态监测提供了强大工具。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Result: 在提出的TexMorph基准测试中，GaussianMorphing显著优于先前的2D/3D方法，颜色一致性误差(ΔE)降低22.2%，EI降低26.2%。

Conclusion: 该集成方法在整个形变过程中保持了局部细节和全局语义一致性，无需标记数据，实现了高质量的3D形状和纹理形变。

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

Method: 在扩散过程核心嵌入视觉Transformer，利用全局上下文推理和迭代去噪来增强体积准确性和边界精度。Transformer骨干网络能够更有效地建模整个MRI体积的空间关系，而扩散细化则减轻体素级误差并恢复细粒度肿瘤细节。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

*Walid Rabehi,Marion Le Texier,Rémi Lemoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个可扩展的深度学习流水线，从1925-1950年的历史地图中提取法国城市区域，创建了首个全国尺度的城市足迹数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1970年代前法国历史城市扩张的定量分析因缺乏全国性数字城市足迹数据而受限。

Method: 采用双通道U-Net方法处理历史地图的高辐射度和风格复杂性，第一通道生成初步地图识别混淆区域，第二通道使用精炼数据集和第一模型输出来最小化辐射噪声。

Result: 处理了941个高分辨率瓦片，覆盖整个法国本土，最终镶嵌图总体准确率达到73%，有效捕捉了多样化城市模式。

Conclusion: 该方法成功克服了历史地图的常见伪影，公开了代码、训练数据集和全国城市栅格数据，支持长期城市化动态研究。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 系统分析腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中点跟踪的失败模式，发现点跟踪对外科工具表现良好，但对解剖目标（如胆囊）表现较差，主要由于组织相似性和边界模糊导致失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解点跟踪在复杂手术环境中的可靠性和失败情况，为手术视频分析提供改进建议。

Method: 在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中，针对胆囊、抓钳和L型电钩三个手术目标，比较点跟踪与分割掩模初始化的性能。

Result: 点跟踪对外科工具具有竞争力，但对解剖目标持续表现不佳，组织相似性和模糊边界是主要失败原因。

Conclusion: 通过定性分析揭示了影响跟踪结果的关键因素，并提供了选择跟踪点和放置位置的可操作建议，以改善手术视频分析性能。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

*Ding-Ruei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FFREEDG新任务：在服务器上预训练后，仅使用客户端未标注数据进行联邦学习，不再访问源数据。提出FRIEREN框架，利用视觉基础模型和视觉语言模态解决该任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在语义分割任务中面临领域偏移挑战，特别是当客户端数据未标注时。现有方法要么不切实际地假设客户端有标注数据，要么未能充分利用现代视觉基础模型的能力。

Method: FRIEREN框架：集成视觉和语言模态，使用基于CLIP文本嵌入的视觉语言解码器改进语义消歧，采用弱到强一致性学习策略在伪标签上进行鲁棒的本地训练。

Result: 在合成到真实、清晰到恶劣天气基准测试中，框架有效解决了新任务，性能与现有领域泛化和适应方法相当，为未来研究建立了强基准。

Conclusion: 提出的FRIEREN框架成功解决了FFREEDG这一具有挑战性的联邦学习任务，展示了利用视觉基础模型处理未标注客户端数据的有效性。

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint是一个用于视频异常检测的结构化提示框架，通过动作中心知识引导冻结的视觉语言模型进行更准确和可解释的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法过于抽象，忽略了定义复杂异常所需的细粒度人-物交互或动作语义，导致在监控视频异常检测中表现不佳。

Method: 将提示组织成语义连贯的组别（如暴力、财产犯罪、公共安全），并制定细粒度的引导问题，使模型预测与判别性视觉线索对齐。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上的实验显示，ASK-Hint持续提升AUC，相比微调和免训练方法都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架强调了提示粒度的重要性，为可解释的视频异常检测提供了一个免训练且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPurify通过学生亲和网络和几何引导池化模块，利用3D自监督教师模型的几何先验来纯化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，有效解决了2D到3D特征转移中的噪声和几何不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D视觉语言模型特征转移到3D语义分割存在权衡：直接投影会产生噪声预测，而强制几何一致性需要昂贵的训练流程和大规模标注3D数据。作者认为这种限制源于分割-匹配范式未能协调2D语义与3D几何结构。

Method: 提出GeoPurify方法，使用小型学生亲和网络，利用从3D自监督教师模型提取的几何先验来纯化2D VLM生成的3D点特征。在推理时设计几何引导池化模块进一步去噪并确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在主要3D基准测试上的广泛实验表明，GeoPurify达到或超越了最先进性能，同时仅使用约1.5%的训练数据，表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: GeoPurify通过利用潜在几何信息和学习的亲和网络，有效缓解了2D到3D特征转移的权衡问题，实现了优越的数据效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于猪耳静脉模式的非侵入性生物识别方法，使用智能手机采集图像，通过多阶段计算机视觉流程提取特征，SVM模型在混合品种猪群中达到98.12%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统猪只识别方法（如耳标、芯片）不可靠、成本高且主要针对纯种猪，不适用于小规模养殖户，需要开发成本效益高且无压力的识别方案。

Method: 收集20头混合品种猪的800张耳部图像，使用标准智能手机和简单背光采集，开发多阶段计算机视觉流程增强静脉可见性，提取结构和空间特征生成生物特征签名，使用机器学习模型进行分类。

Result: 支持向量机（SVM）在混合品种猪群中达到98.12%的识别精度，从图像处理到分类的整个过程平均耗时8.3秒，适合实时农场部署。

Conclusion: 该系统通过用永久性生物标记替代脆弱的物理标识，为农民提供了成本效益高且无压力的动物识别方法，证实了耳静脉生物识别在数字化牲畜管理中的实用性。

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Twins金字塔视觉transformer的多类别计数框架，通过多尺度解码和类别聚焦模块减少类别间干扰，在密集场景下优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 解决密集和遮挡场景中离散检测方法失效的问题，需要开发能够准确估计多类别对象数量的密度图估计方法。

Method: 使用Twins金字塔视觉transformer骨干网络，构建专门的多类别计数头，采用多尺度解码方法，并添加基于分割的类别聚焦模块来抑制训练时的类别间干扰。

Result: 在VisDrone和iSAID基准测试中表现优于现有多类别人群计数方法，MAE分别降低了33%、43%和64%，与YOLOv11比较证明了在密集场景中人群计数方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过区域损失将多类别人群计数扩展到新领域，应用于生物多样性监测数据集，展示了其在保护工作和可扩展生态洞察方面的潜力。

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

TL;DR: TempoControl是一种无需重新训练或额外监督的方法，通过优化交叉注意力图来实现视频生成中的时间控制，允许用户精确指定视觉元素在生成序列中出现的时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成视频模型缺乏细粒度的时间控制能力，无法让用户指定特定视觉元素在生成序列中出现的时间。

Method: 利用文本到视频扩散模型中的交叉注意力图，通过新颖的优化方法引导概念的时间安排，采用三个互补原则：通过相关性对齐时间形状、通过能量放大可见性区域、通过熵保持空间焦点。

Result: TempoControl能够在确保高质量和多样性的同时，实现对时间安排的精确控制，在多种视频生成应用中表现出色，包括单对象和多对象的时间重排序，以及动作和音频对齐生成。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成视频模型提供了有效的时间控制能力，无需重新训练或额外监督，在各种应用中都能实现精确的时间对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

TL;DR: 提出了RewardMap框架，通过密集奖励和多阶段强化学习解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉推理任务中的稀疏奖励和优化不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在结构化信息丰富的场景（如交通地图）中的空间推理能力不足，而标准强化学习面临稀疏奖励和优化不稳定的挑战。

Method: 构建ReasonMap-Plus数据集提供密集奖励信号，提出RewardMap框架包含难度感知奖励设计和多阶段RL方案，从简单感知任务逐步训练到复杂推理任务。

Result: 在ReasonMap和ReasonMap-Plus上实验显示RewardMap各组件均带来性能提升，组合使用效果最佳，在6个基准测试上平均提升3.47%。

Conclusion: RewardMap有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解和推理能力，证明了密集奖励和多阶段训练策略在细粒度视觉推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了DragFlow框架，首次有效利用FLUX的强大先验进行基于拖拽的图像编辑，通过区域级编辑范式和个性化适配器，在拖拽编辑任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型从UNet-based DDPMs转向更可扩展的DiT with flow matching（如SD3.5、FLUX），生成先验显著增强，但基于拖拽的编辑尚未受益于这些更强的先验。现有方法在目标区域存在扭曲问题。

Method: DragFlow引入区域级编辑范式，使用仿射变换提供更丰富一致的特征监督；集成预训练的开域个性化适配器增强主体一致性；采用梯度掩码硬约束保持背景保真度；使用多模态大语言模型解决任务歧义。

Result: 在DragBench-DR和ReD Bench上的广泛实验表明，DragFlow超越了基于点和基于区域的基线方法，在基于拖拽的图像编辑中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DragFlow成功利用FLUX的丰富先验，通过区域级编辑和个性化适配器，显著提升了拖拽编辑的质量和一致性，为基于拖拽的图像编辑设立了新标准。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出F2C方法，通过选择关键片段而非单个关键帧来保持视频的时间连贯性，同时使用自适应分辨率策略在固定计算预算内处理更多视觉标记，显著提升了长视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型面临"大海捞针"问题：原始视频帧产生的大量视觉标记耗尽模型上下文窗口。现有的帧选择方法丢弃了关键的时间动态信息，导致对运动和事件连续性的推理效果不佳。

Method: 提出F2C方法：1) 从孤立关键帧扩展到关键片段选择；2) 采用自适应分辨率策略，动态平衡空间分辨率和片段长度，确保每个视频的标记数量恒定；3) 无需训练即可应用。

Result: 在三个长视频基准测试上，F2C方法比均匀采样分别提升了8.1%(Video-MME)、5.6%(LongVideoBench)和10.3%(MLVU)。

Conclusion: 保持时间连贯性在帧选择中至关重要，F2C为视频大语言模型扩展到实际视频理解应用提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Motivation: 利用机器学习和可穿戴传感器的进步，在非专业实验室环境下捕获和分析人体运动，为远程医疗、运动科学和康复提供准确评估。

Method: 使用VIDIMU数据集，比较四种深度学习框架(MotionAGFormer、MotionBERT、MMPose 2D-to-3D姿态提升和NVIDIA BodyTrack)与基于IMU数据的关节角度计算，采用OpenSim逆运动学方法。

Result: MotionAGFormer表现最优，总体RMSE为9.27°±4.80°，MAE为7.86°±4.18°，Pearson相关系数0.86±0.15，决定系数R²为0.67±0.28。两种技术都可行，但存在成本、可访问性和精度方面的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究明确了现成视频模型在健康成年人中提供临床前景的运动学数据的能力，以及与IMU相比的局限性，为开发远程医疗和远程患者监测的稳健、经济高效解决方案提供了指导。

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Method: 提出Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling(SOAP)构建显著性引导的[FG]token，与全局[CLS]token融合；采用双头LLM派生分类器（冻结和可学习），通过动态知识聚合结合固定先验和演化logits来迭代优化伪标签。

Result: 在13个细粒度基准测试中平均准确率提升2.90%，仅需轻量级适应。

Conclusion: microCLIP能够有效挖掘CLIP中的潜在细粒度信号，显著提升细粒度分类性能，同时保持轻量适应的优势。

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

TL;DR: VidGuard-R1是首个通过多模态大语言模型和群体相对策略优化实现视频真伪检测的系统，提供高精度分类和可解释推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频技术的快速发展，需要有效的检测工具来应对错误信息和声誉损害等社会风险，同时要求检测模型提供可解释的说明以确保监管机构和终端用户的透明度。

Method: 使用群体相对策略优化(GRPO)微调多模态大语言模型(MLLM)，构建包含14万真实和AI生成视频的挑战性数据集，设计专门针对时间伪影和生成复杂度的奖励模型。

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1通过结合高精度检测和可解释推理，为AI生成视频的检测提供了有效的解决方案，代码已公开。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单有效的方法来缓解长视频生成中的质量退化问题，无需长视频教师监督或重新训练长视频数据集。通过利用教师模型的丰富知识为自生成长视频提供指导，保持时间一致性，可将视频长度扩展到教师能力的20倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像和视频生成方面取得了突破性进展，但基于transformer架构的计算成本过高，特别是在生成长视频时。现有自回归方法在超出训练范围时会出现明显的质量退化，这是由于连续潜在空间中误差累积造成的。

Method: 利用教师模型的丰富知识为自生成长视频提供指导。通过从自生成长视频中抽取片段，让教师模型为这些片段提供指导，从而帮助学生模型在长视频生成中保持质量。

Result: 方法能够将视频长度扩展到教师能力的20倍以上，避免过度曝光和误差累积问题。在扩展计算时，能够生成长达4分15秒的视频，相当于基础模型位置嵌入支持的最大跨度的99.9%，比基线模型长50倍以上。

Conclusion: 在标准基准测试和改进基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性方面显著优于基线方法，能够有效缓解长视频生成中的质量退化问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在物理逼真的物体交互方面存在不足，缺乏基于物理的控制机制，限制了其在机器人学和决策模拟中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略，通过物体掩码逐步移除未来运动监督，训练视频扩散模型；结合低级运动控制和高级文本条件，支持复杂动力学现象合成。

Conclusion: KineMask通过物理引导的视频生成方法有效解决了物体交互的物理逼真性问题，为机器人学和决策模拟提供了更可靠的世界模拟器。

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解模型受限于上下文长度，容易错过关键过渡帧且在长时间尺度上难以保持连贯性。

Method: 将原生稀疏注意力(NSA)适配到视频语言模型中，采用硬件感知的混合注意力方法：文本使用密集注意力，视频使用NSA，在21.6万视频指令数据集上进行端到端训练。

Result: 相比token压缩和无训练稀疏基线，VideoNSA在长视频理解、时序推理和空间基准测试上表现更优，能够可靠扩展到128K tokens。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了四个关键发现：可靠的128K token扩展能力、固定预算下的最优全局-局部注意力分配、任务依赖的分支使用模式，以及可学习组合稀疏注意力有助于诱导动态注意力汇聚点。

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

TL;DR: NoiseShift是一种无需训练的方法，通过重新校准去噪器的噪声水平来解决扩散模型在不同分辨率下的泛化问题，显著提升低分辨率图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高分辨率文本到图像生成器无法为不需要高分辨率图像的用户提供经济高效的解决方案，因为扩散模型在固定分辨率训练后难以泛化到其他分辨率，特别是低分辨率。

Method: 提出NoiseShift方法，基于分辨率大小重新校准去噪器的噪声水平，无需改变模型架构或采样计划，与现有模型兼容。

Result: 在LAION-COCO数据集上，NoiseShift将SD3.5的FID提升15.89%，SD3提升8.56%，Flux-Dev提升2.44%；在CelebA数据集上，分别提升10.36%、5.19%和3.02%。

Conclusion: NoiseShift有效缓解了分辨率相关的伪影，显著提升了低分辨率图像生成质量，为扩散模型提供了更好的分辨率泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何从视频中推断需要时间信息才能判断的动态物理属性，如弹性、粘度和动态摩擦，以探索视频基础模型在此类任务中的潜力。

Method: 收集了三个物理属性的新视频数据集；探索了三种推断方法：(a) 使用传统计算机视觉技术的oracle方法；(b) 基于预训练视频生成和自监督模型的可训练提示向量方法；(c) 多模态大语言模型的提示策略。

Result: 生成式或自监督训练的视频基础模型表现相似，但不如oracle方法；多模态大语言模型目前表现较差，但通过合适的提示可以改善性能。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型在预测动态物理属性方面具有潜力，但当前性能仍有限，需要进一步改进模型和方法。

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Conclusion: 提出的对象感知框架能够有效链接声音与相关物体，在声音对象检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了3DGS的脆弱性，提出的攻击方法有效且难以检测，为未来相关安全研究提供了客观基准评估框架。

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在单主体提示上表现良好，但在多主体描述中经常出现属性泄漏、身份纠缠和主体遗漏等问题，需要系统性的解决方案。

Method: 将流匹配视为随机最优控制问题，提出了两种架构无关算法：无训练测试时控制器和轻量级微调规则Adjoint Matching，通过FOCUS框架实现多主体解缠。

Conclusion: 该框架为多主体保真度提供了首个专门设计的微调路径，FOCUS方法在多个模型上实现了最先进的多主体保真度，并能泛化到未见过的提示。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Method: 使用游戏引擎合成教室噪声和房间脉冲响应的可扩展方法，创建RealClass数据集，将合成的教室噪声语料库与从公开语料库编译的教室语音数据集相结合。

Result: 在干净和嘈杂语音上的实验表明，RealClass数据集能够很好地近似真实教室语音。

Conclusion: RealClass数据集在缺乏丰富真实教室语音的情况下是一个有价值的资源，其方法框架可以扩展到教室以外的其他领域。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the
development of AI-driven speech models for education. Classroom datasets remain
limited and not publicly available, and the absence of dedicated classroom
noise or Room Impulse Response (RIR) corpora prevents the use of standard data
augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom
noise and RIRs using game engines, a versatile framework that can extend to
other domains beyond the classroom. Building on this methodology, we present
RealClass, a dataset that combines a synthesized classroom noise corpus with a
classroom speech dataset compiled from publicly available corpora. The speech
data pairs a children's speech corpus with instructional speech extracted from
YouTube videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.
Experiments on clean and noisy speech show that RealClass closely approximates
real classroom speech, making it a valuable asset in the absence of abundant
real classroom speech.

Motivation: 当前的情感TTS和风格转换方法依赖参考编码器控制全局风格或情感向量，但无法捕捉参考语音的细微声学细节，需要更精细的情感控制方法。

Method: 采用风格解耦方法指导两个特征提取器，减少音色和情感特征之间的互信息，有效分离参考语音中的不同风格成分，实现音素级情感嵌入预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在生成自然且情感丰富的语音方面优于基线TTS系统。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了分离和细粒度表示在提升情感TTS系统质量和灵活性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Current emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) and style transfer methods rely on
reference encoders to control global style or emotion vectors, but do not
capture nuanced acoustic details of the reference speech. To this end, we
propose a novel emotional TTS method that enables fine-grained phoneme-level
emotion embedding prediction while disentangling intrinsic attributes of the
reference speech. The proposed method employs a style disentanglement method to
guide two feature extractors, reducing mutual information between timbre and
emotion features, and effectively separating distinct style components from the
reference speech. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline TTS systems in generating natural and emotionally rich speech. This
work highlights the potential of disentangled and fine-grained representations
in advancing the quality and flexibility of emotional TTS systems.

spanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least
five ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的HRTF上采样方法，通过注意力机制捕捉空间相关性，在球谐域中从稀疏测量重建高分辨率HRTF，显著提高了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化HRTF对于沉浸式音频应用至关重要，但测量过程复杂难以大规模应用。现有机器学习方法在高上采样因子下存在长距离空间一致性和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 在球谐域使用基于Transformer的架构，引入注意力机制捕捉HRTF球面的空间相关性，并添加邻居差异损失来增强空间一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在感知定位模型和客观频谱失真指标上都显著优于现有领先方法，能生成更真实、高保真的HRTF。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于Transformer的HRTF上采样方法有效解决了现有方法在空间一致性和高上采样因子下的局限性，为个性化HRTF的大规模应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Personalized Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are starting to be
introduced in many commercial immersive audio applications and are crucial for
realistic spatial audio rendering. However, one of the main hesitations
regarding their introduction is that creating personalized HRTFs is impractical
at scale due to the complexities of the HRTF measurement process. To mitigate
this drawback, HRTF spatial upsampling has been proposed with the aim of
reducing measurements required. While prior work has seen success with
different machine learning (ML) approaches, these models often struggle with
long-range spatial consistency and generalization at high upsampling factors.
In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for HRTF
upsampling, leveraging the attention mechanism to better capture spatial
correlations across the HRTF sphere. Working in the spherical harmonic (SH)
domain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input
measurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial
coherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude
smoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using
both perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics.
Experiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial
margin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs.

TL;DR: 提出MelCap统一神经音频编解码器，使用单一码本处理语音、音乐和通用声音，通过两阶段重建实现高质量音频压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经音频编解码器要么使用单一量化器但仅适用于语音领域，要么使用多量化器但不适合下游任务，需要一种统一高效的解决方案。

Method: 将音频重建分为两阶段：第一阶段将音频转换为mel频谱图，使用2D标记器压缩量化为紧凑单标记；第二阶段通过声码器从mel离散标记恢复波形。

Result: 客观和主观评估表明，MelCap在质量上与最先进的多码本编解码器相当，同时保持了单码本设计的计算简单性。

Conclusion: MelCap提供了一种有效的统一音频表示方法，既保留了声学细节，又适合下游任务应用。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs have recently emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
and low-bitrate audio compression, leveraging deep generative models to learn
latent representations of audio signals. However, existing approaches either
rely on a single quantizer that only processes speech domain, or on multiple
quantizers that are not well suited for downstream tasks. To address this
issue, we propose MelCap, a unified "one-codebook-for-all" neural codec that
effectively handles speech, music, and general sound. By decomposing audio
reconstruction into two stages, our method preserves more acoustic details than
previous single-codebook approaches, while achieving performance comparable to
mainstream multi-codebook methods. In the first stage, audio is transformed
into mel-spectrograms, which are compressed and quantized into compact single
tokens using a 2D tokenizer. A perceptual loss is further applied to mitigate
the over-smoothing artifacts observed in spectrogram reconstruction. In the
second stage, a Vocoder recovers waveforms from the mel discrete tokens in a
single forward pass, enabling real-time decoding. Both objective and subjective
evaluations demonstrate that MelCap achieves quality on comparable to
state-of-the-art multi-codebook codecs, while retaining the computational
simplicity of a single-codebook design, thereby providing an effective
representation for downstream tasks.

Motivation: 受Mamba与注意力机制结合在语音增强中展现的优越跨语料库泛化性能启发，以及Mamba在U-Net结构中实现最先进增强性能的同时减少模型大小和计算复杂度的成果。

Method: 提出RWSA-MambaUNet混合模型，在U-Net结构中结合Mamba和多头注意力机制，采用分辨率共享注意力（RWSA）在对应时间和频率分辨率层间共享注意力。

Result: 最佳模型在两个域外测试集上实现最先进的泛化性能。最小模型在域外DNS 2020测试集上PESQ、SSNR和ESTOI指标超越所有基线，在域外EARS-WHAM_v2测试集上SSNR、ESTOI和SI-SDR指标超越所有基线，同时使用不到一半的模型参数和部分FLOPs。

Conclusion: RWSA-MambaUNet是一种高效混合模型，在保持较小模型规模和低计算成本的同时，实现了卓越的跨语料库语音增强性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech enhancement have shown that models combining Mamba
and attention mechanisms yield superior cross-corpus generalization
performance. At the same time, integrating Mamba in a U-Net structure has
yielded state-of-the-art enhancement performance, while reducing both model
size and computational complexity. Inspired by these insights, we propose
RWSA-MambaUNet, a novel and efficient hybrid model combining Mamba and
multi-head attention in a U-Net structure for improved cross-corpus
performance. Resolution-wise shared attention (RWSA) refers to layerwise
attention-sharing across corresponding time- and frequency resolutions. Our
best-performing RWSA-MambaUNet model achieves state-of-the-art generalization
performance on two out-of-domain test sets. Notably, our smallest model
surpasses all baselines on the out-of-domain DNS 2020 test set in terms of
PESQ, SSNR, and ESTOI, and on the out-of-domain EARS-WHAM_v2 test set in terms
of SSNR, ESTOI, and SI-SDR, while using less than half the model parameters and
a fraction of the FLOPs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GlobalDISCO数据集，这是一个包含73k生成音乐曲目和93k参考曲目的大规模数据集，用于评估音乐生成模型在全球范围内的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音乐生成模型在跨国家、语言、文化和音乐流派的偏见研究不足，且缺乏能够捕捉全球音乐多样性的数据集和基准。

Method: 构建GlobalDISCO数据集，包含来自商业生成音乐模型的73k音乐曲目，配对LAION-DISCO-12M中的93k参考曲目，涵盖147种语言，使用MusicBrainz和Wikipedia提取音乐风格提示，并在全球79个国家平衡分布。

Result: 评估显示高资源和低资源地区在音乐质量和与参考音乐的对齐方面存在巨大差异，主流与地理小众流派之间的模型性能差异显著，某些情况下模型为区域流派生成的音乐更接近主流风格的分布。

Conclusion: 音乐生成模型存在显著的全球偏见问题，需要更多关注低资源地区和小众音乐流派的公平性。

Abstract: While recent years have seen remarkable progress in music generation models,
research on their biases across countries, languages, cultures, and musical
genres remains underexplored. This gap is compounded by the lack of datasets
and benchmarks that capture the global diversity of music. To address these
challenges, we introduce GlobalDISCO, a large-scale dataset consisting of 73k
music tracks generated by state-of-the-art commercial generative music models,
along with paired links to 93k reference tracks in LAION-DISCO-12M. The dataset
spans 147 languages and includes musical style prompts extracted from
MusicBrainz and Wikipedia. The dataset is globally balanced, representing
musical styles from artists across 79 countries and five continents. Our
evaluation reveals large disparities in music quality and alignment with
reference music between high-resource and low-resource regions. Furthermore, we
find marked differences in model performance between mainstream and
geographically niche genres, including cases where models generate music for
regional genres that more closely align with the distribution of mainstream
styles.

Motivation: 开发一种无需训练嵌入器-检测器模型的高效音频水印方法，在保持不可感知性的同时实现强鲁棒性，提供数据集无关的解决方案。

Method: 对44.1kHz立体声音乐片段进行逐音频梯度优化，在预训练音频VAE的潜在空间中添加不可感知扰动，使用组合消息和感知损失进行指导，通过预训练CLAP模型提取水印。

Result: 在MUSDB18-HQ数据集上评估16位水印，相比AudioSeal、WavMark和SilentCipher，在各种常见攻击下获得最佳平均比特错误率，同时保持感知质量。

Conclusion: Timbru展示了一种高效、数据集无关的路径，实现不可感知的音频水印，在鲁棒性和不可感知性之间达到最优平衡。

Abstract: We present Timbru, a post-hoc audio watermarking model that achieves
state-of-the-art robustness and imperceptibility trade-offs without training an
embedder-detector model. Given any 44.1 kHz stereo music snippet, our method
performs per-audio gradient optimization to add imperceptible perturbations in
the latent space of a pretrained audio VAE, guided by a combined message and
perceptual loss. The watermark can then be extracted using a pretrained CLAP
model. We evaluate 16-bit watermarking on MUSDB18-HQ against AudioSeal,
WavMark, and SilentCipher across common filtering, noise, compression,
resampling, cropping, and regeneration attacks. Our approach attains the best
average bit error rates, while preserving perceptual quality, demonstrating an
efficient, dataset-free path to imperceptible audio watermarking.

TL;DR: 提出了首个帧级在线视频到音频生成模型SoundReactor，能够在没有未来视频帧的情况下实时生成高质量音频，解决了传统离线V2A模型在交互应用中的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成模型需要整个视频序列或帧块作为输入，无法满足直播内容创作和生成世界模型等交互应用的需求，因此需要开发能够实时生成音频的在线模型。

Method: 使用解码器因果变换器处理连续音频潜在表示，利用DINOv2视觉编码器提取网格特征并聚合为每帧单个token，通过扩散预训练和一致性微调加速扩散头解码。

Result: 在AAA游戏视频基准测试中，成功生成语义和时间对齐的高质量全频段立体声音频，单H100 GPU上实现低延迟（26.3-31.5ms每帧）。

Conclusion: SoundReactor是首个专门为帧级在线V2A生成设计的有效框架，实现了端到端因果性和音频视觉同步，为交互式应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Prevailing Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation models operate offline, assuming
an entire video sequence or chunks of frames are available beforehand. This
critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content
creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we
introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model
autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video
frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for
this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame
latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a
decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision
conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest
variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token
per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained
through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to
accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay
videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and
temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both
objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame
waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on
30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100. Demo samples are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐表演是人类特有的情感表达活动，机器缺乏情感体验能力，因此需要探索人机协作的新方式

Method: 开发轻量级的开源系统，利用生物信号和音频特征实时自动调制音频效果，可在笔记本电脑上本地运行

Result: 系统目前处于概念验证阶段，需要兼容的数字音频工作站和传感器支持

Conclusion: witheFlow系统为人机协作音乐表演提供了新的技术途径

Abstract: Music performance is a distinctly human activity, intrinsically linked to the
performer's ability to convey, evoke, or express emotion. Machines cannot
perform music in the human sense; they can produce, reproduce, execute, or
synthesize music, but they lack the capacity for affective or emotional
experience. As such, music performance is an ideal candidate through which to
explore aspects of collaboration between humans and machines. In this paper, we
introduce the witheFlow system, designed to enhance real-time music performance
by automatically modulating audio effects based on features extracted from both
biosignals and the audio itself. The system, currently in a proof-of-concept
phase, is designed to be lightweight, able to run locally on a laptop, and is
open-source given the availability of a compatible Digital Audio Workstation
and sensors.

TL;DR: TACOS是一个基于大语言模型的多无人机系统统一框架，通过自然语言界面实现高级任务控制，集成了语言接口、智能协调器和自主代理三个关键能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当单个飞行员管理多无人机系统时，需要支持从直接控制到群体自主行为的不同自主级别交互，语言模型为这种灵活交互提供了自然基础。

Method: TACOS框架整合了：一对多自然语言接口、智能协调器（将用户意图转换为结构化任务计划）、自主代理（与现实世界交互执行计划），并让LLM与可执行API库交互。

Result: 在真实多无人机系统中进行了演示，并通过消融研究评估了各模块的贡献。

Conclusion: TACOS通过LLM实现了语义推理与实时多机器人协调的桥梁，为多无人机系统提供了直观的语言控制能力。

Abstract: When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the
task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual
UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for
accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a
framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models
continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural
foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level
task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we
present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified
framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems
through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities
into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for
intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user
intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans
interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library
of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot
coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and
conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

Abstract: Reliable long-range flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied
environments is challenging: integrating odometry leads to drift, loop closures
are unavailable in previously unseen areas and embedded platforms provide
limited computational power. We present a fully onboard UAV system developed
for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km
long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS
or prior dense mapping. The system integrates perception, mapping, planning,
and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches
LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via
gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered
particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed
kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and
reduced drift substantially relative to raw odometry, while running in real
time on CPU-only hardware. We describe the system architecture, the
localization pipeline, and the competition evaluation, and we report practical
insights from field deployment that inform the design of GNSS-denied UAV
autonomy.

Motivation: 传统运动规划方法在狭窄内陆水域等挑战性空间中往往计算密集或过于保守，需要一种既能保证安全又能实时导航的解决方案。

Method: 采用MPC提供近似运动规划，结合高阶CBFs确保安全性，使用根据船舶与障碍物相对位置和姿态调整膨胀半径的时变膨胀椭圆障碍物表示。

Result: 仿真和真实世界实验表明，该策略使全驱动自主机器人船舶能够在实时条件下安全通过狭窄空间，并能解决潜在的僵局问题。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应膨胀方法相比传统固定椭圆障碍物表示减少了控制器的保守性，为自主船舶在狭窄水域的安全导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Safe motion planning is essential for autonomous vessel operations,
especially in challenging spaces such as narrow inland waterways. However,
conventional motion planning approaches are often computationally intensive or
overly conservative. This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy
combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
We introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the
inflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude
between the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces
the conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid
obstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,
and high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation
radius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed
strategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through
narrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring
safety.

Abstract: State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve
using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations,
or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to
unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph
optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state
estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on
continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process
(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show
adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result
contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity,
and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space.
This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for
inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our
method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to
time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a
CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world
systems.

Conclusion: VENTURA通过视觉路径规划方法有效解决了视觉语言模型在机器人导航中的迁移问题，实现了基于自然语言指令的多样化、安全导航，并展现出组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

TL;DR: INSIGHT是一个学习框架，利用token级不确定性信号来预测VLA模型何时应该请求人类帮助，通过训练紧凑的Transformer分类器实现可靠的帮助触发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型缺乏内省机制来预测失败并请求人类监督，需要开发能够主动识别不确定性并寻求帮助的框架。

Method: 使用π₀-FAST作为基础模型，提取每个token的熵、对数概率以及基于Dirichlet的偶然和认知不确定性估计，训练Transformer分类器将这些序列映射到帮助触发器。

Result: 结果显示强标签能够捕捉细粒度不确定性动态以实现可靠的帮助检测，而弱标签虽然噪声更多，但在训练和评估对齐时仍具有竞争力。建模token级不确定性信号的时间演化比静态序列级分数具有更强的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统评估了VLA中基于不确定性的内省机制，为主动学习和通过选择性人类干预实现实时错误缓解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization
capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures
and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a
learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict
when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we
extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based
estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact
transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore
supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare
them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a
trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty
dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still
support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned,
offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we
find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals
with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static

*Hun Kuk Park,Taekyung Kim,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出动态抛物线控制屏障函数(DPCBF)，通过动态调整抛物线边界来解决非完整机器人在密集动态环境中CBF方法可行性低的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于碰撞锥或速度障碍的CBF方法过于保守，在密集场景中容易导致二次规划不可行，需要更灵活的安全约束

Method: 使用动态抛物线边界定义安全集，抛物线的顶点和曲率根据障碍物距离和相对速度大小自适应调整

Result: DPCBF控制器显著提高了导航成功率和QP可行性，能在100个动态障碍物的密集环境中成功导航，而基于碰撞锥的方法因不可行性而失败

Conclusion: DPCBF为非完整机器人在密集动态环境中的安全导航提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety
of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered,
dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often
rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only
considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and
can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense
scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control
Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary.
The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the
distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a
less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid
for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive
comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller
significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to
baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense
environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision
cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散策略在机器人模仿学习中学习运动学约束的能力，通过双手机器人拾放任务案例，分析了数据集大小、质量和流形曲率对约束学习的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人模仿学习中表现出色，但任务性能不能可靠反映策略学习训练数据中约束的能力，需要研究扩散策略如何准确发现这些约束流形。

Method: 通过双手机器人拾放任务案例研究，分析三个因素对训练策略的影响：数据集大小、数据集质量和流形曲率。

Result: 扩散策略学习到约束流形的粗略近似，数据集大小和质量的降低对学习产生负面影响，而流形曲率与约束满足和任务成功的关系不明确。硬件评估验证了结果的现实适用性。

Conclusion: 扩散策略能够学习运动学约束的近似表示，但学习效果受数据集特征影响，需要进一步研究约束流形特性对学习过程的影响。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have shown impressive results in robot imitation learning,
even for tasks that require satisfaction of kinematic equality constraints.
However, task performance alone is not a reliable indicator of the policy's
ability to precisely learn constraints in the training data. To investigate, we
analyze how well diffusion policies discover these manifolds with a case study
on a bimanual pick-and-place task that encourages fulfillment of a kinematic
constraint for success. We study how three factors affect trained policies:
dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature. Our experiments show
diffusion policies learn a coarse approximation of the constraint manifold with
learning affected negatively by decreases in both dataset size and quality. On
the other hand, the curvature of the constraint manifold showed inconclusive
correlations with both constraint satisfaction and task success. A hardware
evaluation verifies the applicability of our results in the real world. Project

TL;DR: AFFORD2ACT是一个基于功能感知的轻量级机器人学习框架，通过文本提示和单张图像提取语义2D关键点，构建紧凑的38维状态策略，在15分钟内完成训练，在多样化真实世界操作任务中实现82%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的机器人学习方法依赖密集图像或点云输入，计算量大且包含无关背景特征。基于关键点的方法虽然轻量但依赖手动启发式或任务耦合选择，限制了可扩展性和语义理解。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：功能感知过滤、类别级关键点构建、基于变压器的策略学习（包含嵌入式门控机制来推理最相关的关键点）。

Result: 在多样化真实世界操作任务中，AFFORD2ACT持续提升数据效率，在未见过的物体、新类别、背景和干扰物上达到82%的成功率。

Conclusion: AFFORD2ACT框架通过功能感知引导的语义关键点提取，实现了轻量、高效且可扩展的机器人操作学习，无需本体感知或密集表示即可在实时环境中良好运行。

Abstract: Vision-based robot learning often relies on dense image or point-cloud
inputs, which are computationally heavy and entangle irrelevant background
features. Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric
features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or
task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To
address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that
distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single
image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering,
category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning
with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a
compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which
performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations.
Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves
data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel
categories, backgrounds, and distractors.

Abstract: Robotic automation is accelerating scientific discovery by reducing manual
effort in laboratory workflows. However, precise manipulation of powders
remains challenging, particularly in tasks such as transport that demand
accuracy and stability. We propose a trajectory optimisation framework for
powder transport in laboratory settings, which integrates differentiable
physics simulation for accurate modelling of granular dynamics, low-dimensional
skill-space parameterisation to reduce optimisation complexity, and a
curriculum-based strategy that progressively refines task competence over long
horizons. This formulation enables end-to-end optimisation of contact-rich
robot trajectories while maintaining stability and convergence efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
task success rates and stability compared to the reinforcement learning
baseline.

TL;DR: 开发了一种协作机器人引导系统，通过触觉反馈帮助在保乳手术中定位肿瘤边界，在模拟实验中显示能改善切除边缘并降低手术难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保乳手术中肿瘤边界定位困难，因为肿瘤通常高度移动、不可触及且形状不规则，需要一种能精确定位肿瘤边界的技术。

Method: 将小型触觉机器人改装为电灼刀，结合超声和电磁导航识别肿瘤边界，当手术工具碰撞到肿瘤边界时施加禁止区域虚拟夹具，在模拟实验中比较有无触觉引导的切除效果。

Result: 虚拟夹具引导改善了切除边缘，用户在使用触觉反馈时感觉任务更轻松、挫折感更低、所需努力更少，但也发现了一些对手术流程的意外影响。

Conclusion: 虚拟夹具能在模拟保乳手术中帮助定位肿瘤边界，未来将进行更广泛的用户研究来验证结果并优化引导系统。

Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is
challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have
irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a
cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor
localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can
be successfully integrated into breast cancer care.
  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to
operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and
electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and
position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool
collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked
to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic
guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On
average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and
effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some
unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments
and training protocol moving forward.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor
boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an
extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our
guidance system.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在机器人导航中存在根本限制：缺乏持久场景记忆、空间推理能力有限，且无法有效扩展以支持实时视频应用。

Method: 采用分块处理视频序列的方法，利用现代视觉语言模型构建持久知识图谱，保持对象身份随时间的一致性，并通过可查询的图结构实现可解释的空间推理。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but
encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer
limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for
real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system
that tackles these challenges using spatiotemporal knowledge graph construction
and computationally efficient query processing for navigation goal
identification. Our approach processes video sequences in chunks utilizing
modern VLMs, creates persistent knowledge graphs that maintain object identity
over time, and enables explainable spatial reasoning through queryable graph
structures. We also introduce WalkieKnowledge, a new benchmark with about 200
manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning
approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between
structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a
differential drive robot demonstrates practical applicability, with our method
achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5
Pro performance while providing explainable reasoning supported by the
knowledge graph, computational efficiency for real-time deployment across

Motivation: 研究旨在解决自由漂浮、生物启发的多连杆机器人在关节无驱动、仅有最小传感器配置（每个连杆单个陀螺仪）情况下的姿态估计挑战，这种平台具有欠驱动和最小感知的特点。

Method: 采用无迹卡尔曼滤波，并增强高斯过程残差学习来补偿非零均值、非高斯噪声。通过概念验证硬件实验和离线卡尔曼滤波分析进行评估。

Result: 实验表明机器人姿态可以可靠估计。在多步态数据集上训练的滤波器与仅在前进步态数据集上训练的滤波器在相同前进步态测试轨迹上表现相当。

Conclusion: 结果表明步态输入空间存在重叠，可以利用这一特性减少训练数据需求，同时增强滤波器在多种步态间的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a
free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints,
link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting
in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept
hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the
robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an
unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to
compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter
trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning)
performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when
both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results
reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce
training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across
multiple gaits.

Conclusion: 该物理信息策略克服了谱偏差和神经场拟合困难，实现了成本景观的平滑精确表示，提升了复杂场景下的导航性能

Abstract: Robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments is a
challenging problem. The existing approaches, such as traditional
sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while
imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.
Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising
solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without
relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered
by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish
their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach
decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high
level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at
the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by
solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common
pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in
a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our
framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability
and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for
online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time multi-plane segmentation method based on
GPU-accelerated high-resolution 3D voxel mapping for legged robot locomotion.
Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and
computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors
suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot
represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane
segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these
limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based
connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection
and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar
regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and
accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a
resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time
for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged
robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D
planar structures.

Result: 开发出轻量化可穿戴系统，能够进行穿戴式演示数据采集，并通过模仿学习实现稳健的双手操作

Conclusion: MiniBEE系统通过紧凑设计扩大了灵巧工作空间，为双手操作提供了新的可行方案

Abstract: Bimanual robot manipulators can achieve impressive dexterity, but typically
rely on two full six- or seven- degree-of-freedom arms so that paired grippers
can coordinate effectively. This traditional framework increases system
complexity while only exploiting a fraction of the overall workspace for
dexterous interaction. We introduce the MiniBEE (Miniature Bimanual
End-effector), a compact system in which two reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF
each) are coupled into a kinematic chain that preserves full relative
positioning between grippers. To guide our design, we formulate a kinematic
dexterity metric that enlarges the dexterous workspace while keeping the
mechanism lightweight and wearable. The resulting system supports two
complementary modes: (i) wearable kinesthetic data collection with self-tracked
gripper poses, and (ii) deployment on a standard robot arm, extending dexterity
across its entire workspace. We present kinematic analysis and design
optimization methods for maximizing dexterous range, and demonstrate an
end-to-end pipeline in which wearable demonstrations train imitation learning
policies that perform robust, real-world bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers
in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual

kinematics via precise pose alignment. To ensure mobility and data quality, we
introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a

ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception.
By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted

manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies
trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\%
on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a

Conclusion: FailSafe系统有效解决了VLA模型在机器人操作中的故障恢复挑战，显著提升了模型性能，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic
control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve
strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale
crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures
during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from
unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing
robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real
world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable
to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure
detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to
utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a
novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces
diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be
seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable
creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune
LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results
show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from
potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA
models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several
tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different
spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to
release the FailSafe code to the community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线学习测量可靠性的统计框架，通过多视角几何一致性作为自监督，动态评估视觉-惯性里程计中传感器测量的可靠性，相比固定不确定性参数的方法显著提升了跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设所有测量具有静态、均匀的不确定性，无法捕捉真实世界数据中动态变化的误差特性，限制了视觉-惯性里程计的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于统计框架，从传感器数据和优化结果中在线学习测量可靠性评估，利用多视角几何一致性作为自监督，推断地标不确定性并自适应调整视觉测量权重。

Result: 在EuRoC数据集上的评估显示，相比固定不确定性参数的基线方法，平均平移误差减少约24%，旋转误差减少约42%，同时保持实时运行。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实时运行，在精度和鲁棒性方面均有提升，源代码将公开以促进可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is to
dynamically assess the reliability of sensor measurements. This assessment is
crucial for properly weighting the contribution of each measurement to the
state estimate. Conventional methods often simplify this by assuming a static,
uniform uncertainty for all measurements. This heuristic, however, may be
limited in its ability to capture the dynamic error characteristics inherent in
real-world data. To improve this limitation, we present a statistical framework
that learns measurement reliability assessment online, directly from sensor
data and optimization results. Our approach leverages multi-view geometric
consistency as a form of self-supervision. This enables the system to infer
landmark uncertainty and adaptively weight visual measurements during
optimization. We evaluated our method on the public EuRoC dataset,
demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy with average reductions of
approximately 24\% in translation error and 42\% in rotation error compared to
baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters. The resulting framework
operates in real time while showing enhanced accuracy and robustness. To
facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the source code will
be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决动态环境中多步操作的挑战：模仿学习缺乏组合泛化能力，而传统任务运动规划存在规划延迟问题，无法实时恢复故障。

Method: 从无标注演示中联合学习谓词、操作符和技能，使用符号规划器组合和重排序技能以实现符号目标，在运动和符号层面进行实时恢复。

Result: 在RoboCasa模拟中执行12个单步任务成功率85%，无需额外数据即可组合成最多6次技能重组的复杂任务；在真实机器人上从5分钟无标注数据学习后能执行多种任务。

Conclusion: SymSkill框架成功结合了IL和TAMP的优势，实现了组合泛化和实时故障恢复，在模拟和真实环境中都表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments remains challenging. Two
major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is
reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not
decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion
planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency,
preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified
learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing
compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline,
SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from
unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a
conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner
to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while
performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.
Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted
execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,
SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without
additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to
6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real
Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented
and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal
specifications. The source code and additional analysis can be found on

*Jaewoo Lee,Dongjae Lee,Jinwoo Lee,Hyungyu Lee,Yeonjoon Kim,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑伺服和转子动力学的几何反步控制器，用于可变倾斜全向多旋翼飞行器，相比忽略执行器动力学的基线方法具有更好的跟踪性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有执行器感知控制方法依赖于执行器输入与力矩之间的线性关系，无法捕捉可变倾斜角度引起的非线性效应，这在剧烈飞行或突然扰动恢复时会影响控制效果和可靠性。

Method: 利用多旋翼刚体动力学与非线性执行器动力学之间的级联结构，设计几何反步控制器，并证明整个系统的指数稳定性。

Result: 在快速平移跟踪、快速旋转跟踪和突然扰动恢复三个实验场景中，所提控制器相比基线方法始终获得更好的跟踪性能，在基线方法发散坠毁的情况下仍能保持稳定完成任务。

Conclusion: 所提出的控制器能有效处理执行器非线性动力学，对参数不确定性具有鲁棒性，在剧烈飞行条件下表现出优越的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt
omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor
dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and
reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery
from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware
control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on
linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture
the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit
the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its
nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and
establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal
parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we
demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such
uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not
account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast
translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden
disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking
performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the
fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the
proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,
thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: PolySim是一个多仿真器平台，通过同时使用多个异构仿真器训练人形机器人全身控制策略，减少仿真器归纳偏差，实现零样本从仿真到真实世界的部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仿真到真实世界的差距问题，该差距源于单个仿真器的归纳偏差（内在假设和限制），导致跨仿真器和仿真-真实世界之间存在显著差异。

Method: 开发PolySim平台，集成多个异构仿真器，在单个训练运行中同时启动来自不同引擎的并行环境，实现动态层面的领域随机化。

Result: 在仿真间评估中显著减少运动跟踪误差，在MuJoCo上比IsaacSim基线提高52.8%的执行成功率；在真实Unitree G1机器人上实现零样本部署，无需额外微调。

Conclusion: PolySim通过多仿真器联合训练有效缓解仿真器归纳偏差，提供比单仿真器训练更紧的上界，成功实现从仿真到真实世界的有效迁移。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer
from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive
bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These
biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between
simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive
bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,
encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond
any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training
platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch
parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single
training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.
Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator
inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim
substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for
example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim
baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1
without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to
the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.

TL;DR: 提出Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL)，通过对比学习将视觉语言模型的表示与机器人本体感知状态对齐，提升VLA模型在机器人操作任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在机器人操作中表现良好，但其表示对机器人信号（如控制动作和本体感知状态）不够敏感，导致表示不够优化。

Method: 引入RS-CL对比损失函数，使用机器人状态间的相对距离作为软监督，将VLM表示与机器人本体感知状态对齐，同时保持与标准VLA训练流程的兼容性。

Result: 在RoboCasa-Kitchen的拾放任务中，成功率从30.8%提升至41.5%；在真实机器人操作任务中，成功率从45.0%提升至58.3%。

Conclusion: RS-CL能够有效增强VLA模型的控制相关表示学习，显著提升机器人操作性能，且方法轻量级、易于集成。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot
manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain
suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and
proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware
Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization
for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and
robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely
with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the
states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction
objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning,
while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training
pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves
the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the
prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen,
through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts
success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型磁性连续体机器人设计，通过在导管壁内径向嵌入永磁体，实现单一外部永磁体独立控制弯曲或扭转运动，并开发了基于扭转剪切的双层阻塞机制实现按需药物释放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统轴向磁化设计的磁性连续体机器人主要限于弯曲运动，限制了其变形能力。为了扩展变形能力，需要开发能够独立控制弯曲和扭转的新型设计。

Method: 采用在导管壁内径向嵌入永磁体的简单组装方法，结合物理基础建模和有限元分析建立驱动原理，并通过实验验证解耦模式控制。开发了由外部凹槽和内部板组成的双层阻塞机制，利用扭转剪切实现按需药物释放。

Result: 实验验证了在实际磁场下的解耦模式控制，并在仿体干预实验中展示了端到端操作：通过弯曲进行目标接近，随后在目标位置通过扭转激活释放。

Conclusion: 该紧凑、无缆平台结合了多功能变形与精确有效载荷输送，显示出在下一代靶向治疗中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through
tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been
limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper
presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the
catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to
independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation
together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and
benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields.
Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves
and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release.
Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end
operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by
twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform
combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong
potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.

Motivation: 现代智能工厂可能包含数百台机器，而现有的SFE求解器只能扩展到几十台机器，存在可扩展性不足的问题。

Method: 提出了TS-ACES（基于交通系统的任意时间循环嵌入求解器），这是一种完整的求解方法。

Result: TS-ACES能够扩展到基于真实工业场景的SFE实例，处理超过一百台机器的情况。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了智能工厂嵌入问题在大规模场景下的求解空白，提供了首个高度可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern automated factories increasingly run manufacturing procedures using a
matrix of programmable machines, such as 3D printers, interconnected by a
programmable transport system, such as a fleet of tabletop robots. To embed a
manufacturing procedure into a smart factory, an operator must: (a) assign each
of its processes to a machine and (b) specify how agents should transport parts
between machines. The problem of embedding a manufacturing process into a smart
factory is termed the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem. State-of-the-art
SFE solvers can only scale to factories containing a couple dozen machines.
Modern smart factories, however, may contain hundreds of machines. We fill this
hole by introducing the first highly scalable solution to the SFE, TS-ACES, the
Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver. We show that TS-ACES is
complete and can scale to SFE instances based on real industrial scenarios with
more than a hundred machines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种基于模型预测控制的运动提示算法，通过惩罚感觉冲突和比力误差来联合优化驾驶模拟器的保真度和舒适度，实验显示能显著减少晕动症而不影响保真度评级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶模拟器在研发中应用日益广泛，但由于运动缩放和视觉未缩放导致晕动症，需要开发能同时优化保真度和舒适度的运动提示算法。

Method: 使用模型预测控制开发运动提示算法，在成本函数中同时惩罚感觉冲突和比力误差，进行人机闭环实验比较四种运动设置：两种MPC算法变体、自适应洗出算法和无运动情况。

Result: 实验结果显示，折衷方案相比自适应洗出和纯比力跟踪算法，晕动症减少超过50%（平均MISC水平从3降至1.5），且保真度评级无显著下降。

Conclusion: 提出的考虑模拟器动力学和晕动症时间演化的运动提示算法开发方法，在实现晕动症控制和比力重现最优平衡方面取得重要进展，支持模拟器的更广泛应用。

Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development.
However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and
unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is
proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical
conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory
conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing
the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion
settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure
specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and
motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no
motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator
with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model
predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the
lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The
compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)
compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force
tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the
simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant
advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific
force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中应用广泛，但高推理延迟阻碍实时部署。现有早期退出方法受限于任务依赖性，难以适应多样化场景。自动驾驶的导航系统能够预测即将到来的上下文（如交叉口、交通灯），这为任务特定退出提供了机会。

Result: 在CODA、Waymo和BOSCH数据集上，Nav-EE在保持与完整推理相当准确性的同时，将延迟降低高达63.9%。与Autoware Universe集成后，推理延迟从600ms降至300ms，支持复杂场景下更快的决策制定。

Conclusion: 将导航预见性与早期退出相结合，为在自动驾驶系统中高效部署大型模型提供了可行路径。代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving
for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders
real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at
intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across
diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous
driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g.,
intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We
propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes
task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on
navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE
achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to
63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates
reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making
in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight
with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large
models in autonomous systems. Code and data are available at our anonymous

Motivation: 为四足机器人提供一个便携式平台，系统研究脊柱柔顺性在腿式运动中的作用。

Method: 集成三个扭矩控制执行器、定制1kHz控制板和受保护电源单元，开发基于RNEA的计算加速度控制器，带有平滑Stribeck摩擦补偿。

Result: 实验验证了线性力-位移特性，水平刚度300-700N/m，相对误差≤1.5%；动态测试确认了质量-弹簧-阻尼器响应。

Conclusion: SPARC为腿式运动中的脊柱柔顺性研究提供了系统平台，将发布完整的硬件和固件资源。

Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module
that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable
task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three
torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected
power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping
shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration
controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper
behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the
approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement
characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <=
1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic
displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple
damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to
configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD
controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and
coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies
of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete
hardware and firmware resources.

Conclusion: 感知质量和测试时策略是性能的关键驱动因素，为未来物体目标导航的发展提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying
mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools,
and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in
previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success
requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely
challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant
paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field
still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive
performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular
RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components:
perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled
experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends:
perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of
performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only
marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design
guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses
State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We
also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts
achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and
human-level navigation. Our study not only sets the SotA performance but also
provides principled guidance for future ObjectNav development and evaluation.

Motivation: 当前人形机器人足球面临的主要挑战是在进行激烈踢球动作时保持系统稳定性，同时实现精确的球轨迹控制。现有的位置控制方法和强化学习方法存在显著局限性，而模型预测控制方法在腿摆动过程中往往过度简化，限制了脚的环境交互能力。

Abstract: Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in
maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving
precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional
position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches,
exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent
approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated
advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing
progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This
severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering
tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal
trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to
bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot
trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and
acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental
results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking
behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments
confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms,
and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the
soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.

Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase
should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are
crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However,
manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing
relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is
capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological
impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated
through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric
vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with
the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and
efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital
twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource
asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships
across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific
production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a
product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network
(Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the
manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.

Abstract: Simulating greenhouse environments is critical for developing and evaluating
robotic systems for agriculture, yet existing approaches rely on simplistic or
synthetic assets that limit simulation-to-real transfer. Recent advances in
radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic
reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or
controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a
framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly
from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a
ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling
tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82
cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility
for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward
greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future
research in agricultural robotics.

Conclusion: EC3R-SLAM展示了在现实世界机器人应用中实现高效、鲁棒SLAM的潜力，特别适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: The application of monocular dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) is often hindered by high latency, large GPU memory consumption, and
reliance on camera calibration. To relax this constraint, we propose EC3R-SLAM,
a novel calibration-free monocular dense SLAM framework that jointly achieves
high localization and mapping accuracy, low latency, and low GPU memory
consumption. This enables the framework to achieve efficiency through the
coupling of a tracking module, which maintains a sparse map of feature points,
and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that
simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. In addition, both local and global
loop closures are incorporated to ensure mid-term and long-term data
association, enforcing multi-view consistency and thereby enhancing the overall
accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, while being faster and more memory-efficient.
Moreover, it runs effectively even on resource-constrained platforms such as
laptops and Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its potential for real-world robotics
applications.

Abstract: The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle
ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge,
we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework.
The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage
their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception
capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions
and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects.
Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part
segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby
extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained
part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework
accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying
critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for
task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by
integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping
from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the
adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured
environments. More information and code are available here:

*Philip Reichenberg,Tim Laue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文介绍了NAO机器人站起动作的改进方法，通过解决关节位置误差问题显著提高了站起成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 站起动作是人形机器人足球比赛中的关键能力，无法自主站起的机器人会被罚下场。

Method: 通过执行特殊动作释放卡住的肢体（如手臂），或使用其他关节补偿大误差来解决问题。

Result: 显著提高了站起动作的整体成功率，其他团队采用该方法后也取得了类似效果。

Conclusion: 该方法经过6年验证有效，解决了关节位置误差导致的站起失败问题。

Abstract: Stand-up motions are an indispensable part of humanoid robot soccer. A robot
incapable of standing up by itself is removed from the game for some time. In
this paper, we present our stand-up motions for the NAO robot. Our approach
dates back to 2019 and has been evaluated and slightly expanded over the past
six years. We claim that the main reason for failed stand-up attempts are large
errors in the executed joint positions. By addressing such problems by either
executing special motions to free up stuck limbs such as the arms, or by
compensating large errors with other joints, we significantly increased the
overall success rate of our stand-up routine. The motions presented in this
paper are also used by several other teams in the Standard Platform League,
which thereby achieve similar success rates, as shown in an analysis of videos
from multiple tournaments.

Abstract: We introduce the soft curvature and spectroscopy (SCANS) system: a versatile,
electronics-free, fluidically actuated soft manipulator capable of assessing
the spectral properties of objects either in hand or through pre-touch caging.
This platform offers a wider spectral sensing capability than previous soft
robotic counterparts. We perform a material analysis to explore optimal soft
substrates for spectral sensing, and evaluate both pre-touch and in-hand
performance. Experiments demonstrate explainable, statistical separation across
diverse object classes and sizes (metal, wood, plastic, organic, paper, foam),
with large spectral angle differences between items. Through linear
discriminant analysis, we show that sensitivity in the near-infrared
wavelengths is critical to distinguishing visually similar objects. These
capabilities advance the potential of optics as a multi-functional sensory
modality for soft robots. The complete parts list, assembly guidelines, and

Motivation: 传统方法由于固定数据集而泛化能力差，现有LLM和VLM方法虽然语义丰富但缺乏鲁棒灵活的精炼机制，导致布局质量不佳。

Method: 开发了语义精炼工具(SRT)修正抽象对象关系，物理精炼工具(PRT)通过网格匹配算法解决具体空间问题，并采用多智能体框架（规划器、设计器、评估器）协调这些工具。

Result: 实验证明DisCo-Layout达到了最先进的性能，能够生成真实、连贯且可泛化的3D室内布局。

Conclusion: DisCo-Layout通过解耦物理和语义精炼，并协调多智能体协作，有效提升了3D室内布局合成的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.
Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While
recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they
often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We
develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates
physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic
Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the
Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a
grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework
intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement
rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.
Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating
realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be
publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FalconGym 2.0是一个基于高斯溅射的仿真框架，通过性能引导精炼算法训练视觉策略，在无人机导航中实现了优越的泛化性和鲁棒性，并能零样本迁移到真实硬件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉策略在航迹几何变化时性能下降，需要开发能够泛化到不同航迹的视觉导航策略。

Method: 开发FalconGym 2.0仿真框架，使用高斯溅射技术快速生成多样化航迹，并提出性能引导精炼算法集中训练挑战性航迹。

Result: 在固定翼无人机和四旋翼两个案例中，单一视觉策略在三个未见航迹上达到100%成功率，在门姿态扰动下保持更高成功率，并能零样本迁移到真实四旋翼硬件（98.6%成功率）。

Conclusion: FalconGym 2.0结合性能引导精炼算法能够训练出具有强泛化能力和鲁棒性的视觉策略，实现有效的仿真到真实迁移。

Abstract: Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However,
state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their
performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a
photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with
an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks
in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a
Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual
policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its
performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with
distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%
success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under
gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a
quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30
trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的运动重定向方法GMR，通过系统评估重定向质量对策略性能的影响，解决了现有方法中存在的脚滑、自穿透等伪影问题，在跟踪性能和运动保真度方面优于现有开源方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人运动跟踪中的人体-机器人体现差距问题，现有重定向方法会在参考轨迹中留下伪影，需要强化学习策略进行修正，但通常需要大量奖励工程和领域随机化才能成功。

Method: 提出通用运动重定向(GMR)方法，与PHC、ProtoMotions等开源重定向器以及Unitree的高质量闭源数据集进行比较，使用BeyondMimic进行策略训练以隔离重定向效果。

Result: 在LAFAN1数据集上的实验表明，GMR在跟踪性能和运动保真度方面一致优于现有开源方法，达到了接近闭源基线的感知保真度和策略成功率。

Conclusion: 重定向质量对策略性能有显著影响，GMR方法能够有效减少重定向伪影，提高策略的鲁棒性，特别是在动态或长序列运动中表现更佳。

Abstract: Humanoid motion tracking policies are central to building teleoperation
pipelines and hierarchical controllers, yet they face a fundamental challenge:
the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots. Current approaches
address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and
then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference
trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot
sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in
the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has
demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward
engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when
excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with
existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General
Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source
retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source
dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate
retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset
of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts
in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for
dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source
methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion,
achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the
closed-source baseline. Website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过显式地将策略与相机外参条件化来实现视角不变的模仿学习，使用Plucker嵌入表示像素光线，显著提升了多种行为克隆策略在不同视角下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模仿学习策略在视角变化时性能下降的问题，特别是在固定场景中策略可能利用静态背景线索推断相机姿态，导致在真实视角变化时失效。

Method: 使用Plucker嵌入表示每像素光线，将相机外参作为策略的显式条件输入，在RoboSuite和ManiSkill中构建了6个操纵任务来评估策略在视角变化下的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，不包含外参的策略在固定场景中依赖背景线索推断相机姿态，但在视角变化时性能崩溃；而条件化外参的策略恢复了性能，实现了仅使用RGB输入的鲁棒控制。

Conclusion: 显式地将相机外参条件化到策略中能够显著提升模仿学习在视角变化下的鲁棒性，无需深度信息即可实现可靠的RGB控制。

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning
policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we
show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization
across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,
Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic
viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and
ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling
background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without
extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in
fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera
placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields
robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,
and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

TL;DR: ARMADA是一个多机器人部署和适应系统，通过FLOAT自主故障检测方法实现人类在环共享控制，显著减少对人类监督的依赖，提高策略部署效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习虽然能从大规模真实世界数据中学习，但预训练策略在没有足够领域内数据时表现不佳，且人工收集演示数据成本高、质量参差不齐。现有的人类在环系统需要全程人工监控，效率低下。

Method: 开发ARMADA系统，包含FLOAT自主在线故障检测方法，实现并行策略部署，仅在必要时请求人工干预，通过共享控制机制高效获取领域内数据。

Result: FLOAT故障检测准确率平均达到近95%，比现有最佳方法提升超过20%。ARMADA在多次策略部署和后训练中，成功率提升超过4倍，人工干预率降低超过2倍。

Conclusion: ARMADA系统通过自主故障检测和共享控制机制，显著减少了人类监督需求，实现了更高效的领域内数据获取和更快的场景适应能力。

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown promise in learning from large-scale real-world
datasets. However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without
sufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail
substantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant
information. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific
data for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer
informative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during
policy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and
adaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an
autonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA
enables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when
necessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA
enables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable
deployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance
of ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on
average, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over
20%. Besides, ARMADA manifests more than 4$\times$ increase in success rate and
greater than 2$\times$ reduction in human intervention rate over multiple
rounds of policy rollout and post-training, compared to previous
human-in-the-loop learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的计算和内存需求日益增长，需要在不影响性能的前提下优化资源使用。传统浮点表示每个值都有专用缩放因子，导致存储和计算开销较大。

Method: 采用微缩放浮点格式，在数值块中共享缩放因子，实现紧凑的8位浮点表示并保持扩展动态范围。在GPT-2架构中测试了多种微缩放浮点配置。

Result: 实验表明微缩放数据格式在训练和推理过程中能够保持竞争力精度，显著减少内存占用和计算成本。

Conclusion: 微缩放格式是部署大规模LLM的资源高效替代方案，源代码已公开。

Abstract: The increasing computational and memory demands of large language models
(LLMs) necessitate innovative approaches to optimize resource usage without
compromising performance. This paper leverages microscaling floating-point
formats, a novel technique designed to address these challenges by reducing the
storage and computational overhead associated with numerical representations in
LLMs. Unlike traditional floating-point representations that allocate a
dedicated scale for each value, microscaling employs a shared scale across a
block of values, enabling compact one-byte floating-point representations while
maintaining an extended dynamic range. We explore the application of
microscaling in the context of 8-bit floating-point formats to significantly
reduce memory footprint and computational costs. We tested several
configurations of microscaling floats within the GPT-2 LLM architecture,
demonstrating that microscaling data formats can achieve competitive accuracy
during training and inference, proving its efficacy as a resource-efficient
alternative for deploying LLMs at scale. The source code is publicly available

Conclusion: VarCoNet为静息态fMRI中的功能连接分析提供了一个通用且鲁棒的框架。

Abstract: Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to
precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual
variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an
enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC)
extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs
self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional
inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that
generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the
absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel
augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core,
VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series
processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our
VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject
fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii)
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the
ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our
extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning
methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and
generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework
for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OST-AR依赖视觉叠加可能造成注意力过载，且在遮挡或光照不佳时深度线索不足，需要探索多模态反馈来克服这些限制。

Method: 设计定制腕带配备六个振动电机，提供方向和状态提示，与手持工具和OST-AR集成，通过形成性研究和两个实验评估其对提示识别和深度引导的影响。

Result: 参与者在认知负荷下能准确识别触觉模式，多模态反馈相比纯视觉或纯触觉条件在空间精度和可用性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 结合OST-AR和腕部触觉反馈的多模态系统能有效提升深度感知精度和用户体验，为AR引导任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and
annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on
tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth
perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly
affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument
reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair
performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and
leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers
perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that
combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have
seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated
skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind
users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal
audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn
feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of
longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors
found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.
These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on
wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors
delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and
OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a
formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants
accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal
feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or
haptic-only conditions.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the
confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and
claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete
scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety
Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to
prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless
augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work
by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system
architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We
also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within
hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves
sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching
environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在场景中均匀分配资源，限制了感兴趣区域的精细细节，导致模型大小膨胀。需要一种能够优先处理选定对象高分辨率细节的方法。

Method: 提出ROI-GS框架，包括对象引导相机选择、针对性对象训练，以及将高质量对象重建无缝集成到全局场景中。

Conclusion: ROI-GS有效解决了3D场景重建中资源分配不均的问题，在保持实时性能的同时实现了感兴趣区域的高质量细节重建。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

*Georgios Kouros,Minye Wu,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D高斯泼溅和延迟着色的可重光照框架，使用微表面BRDF和镜面光泽度参数化，实现更物理一致的材料分解和高质量重光照效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法通常依赖简化的BRDF模型或耦合漫反射和镜面反射的参数化，限制了材料恢复的准确性和重光照的保真度。

Method: 将微表面BRDF与镜面光泽度参数化集成到2D高斯泼溅中，采用延迟着色；使用基于扩散的表面法线和漫反射颜色先验指导早期优化；采用环境图的由粗到精优化策略。

Result: 在复杂光泽场景上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了高质量的几何和材料重建，相比现有高斯泼溅方法，在新光照下提供了更真实和一致的重光照效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理一致的BRDF模型和有效的优化策略，显著提升了光泽物体的重建和重光照质量。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

TL;DR: 介绍使用Python库Manim创建教学动画的方法，分析其在STEM教育中的有效性，并展示跨学科应用潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEM概念复杂抽象，传统静态图形教学效果有限，而专业动画制作耗时不便，需要找到一种简便有效的方法来创建教学动画

Method: 使用Python的Manim库创建动画视频课程，通过社交媒体收集观众反馈评估效果，并展示计算机科学和数学之外的应用案例

Result: Manim能够简化动画制作过程，创建出视觉吸引力强的教学动画，观众反馈表明这些可视化工具能有效提升学习效果

Conclusion: Manim是一个功能强大且易于使用的工具，能够帮助教育工作者创建高质量的教学动画，在STEM教育及其他学科中具有广泛应用前景

Abstract: Many STEM concepts pose significant learning challenges to students due to
their inherent complexity and abstract nature. Visualizing complex problems
through animations can significantly enhance learning outcomes. However, the
creation of animations can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Hence, many
educators illustrate complex concepts by hand on a board or a digital device.
Although static graphics are helpful for understanding, they are less effective
than animations. The free and open-source Python package Manim enables
educators to create visually compelling animations easily. Python's
straightforward syntax, combined with Manim's comprehensive set of built-in
classes and methods, greatly simplifies implementation. This article presents a
series of examples that demonstrate how Manim can be used to create animated
video lessons for a variety of topics in computer science and mathematics. In
addition, it analyzes viewer feedback collected across multiple social media
platforms to evaluate the effectiveness and accessibility of these
visualizations. The article further explores broader potentials of the Manim
Python library by showcasing demonstrations that extend its applications to
subject areas beyond computer science and mathematics.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个四维框架，识别了五种不同的共同探索活动模式，揭示了共同探索在设计过程中的重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在设计过程中至关重要，能促进创造力和提升设计成果。本研究旨在解构设计团队中的共同探索这一协作动态实践。

Method: 对16个设计团队的61名学生进行了为期五个月的纵向观察研究，采用每周日记访谈的方法。

Result: 研究发现共同探索在不同团队互动中发挥作用，培养团队凝聚力，保持开放心态和参与度，促进集体智慧，使团队能够积极分享知识、相互借鉴想法，实现超越个人贡献的成果。

Conclusion: 共同探索反映了设计成功的轨迹，具有重要价值，值得进一步研究。研究为未来从业者提供了增强设计协作中共同探索的策略性见解。

Abstract: Exploration is crucial in the design process and is known for its essential
role in fostering creativity and enhancing design outcomes. Within design
teams, exploration evolves into co-exploration, a collaborative and dynamic
practice that this study aims to unpack. To investigate this experience, we
conducted a longitudinal observational study with 61 students across 16 design
teams. Over five months of weekly diary-interviews, we uncovered the intricate
dynamics of co-exploration. Our main contribution is a four-dimensional
framework that identifies five distinct patterns of co-exploration activities.
Our findings reveal how co-exploration emerges across various activities
throughout the design process, demonstrating its role in different team
interactions. It fosters a sense of togetherness, keeping design teams
open-minded and engaged. This engagement cultivates collective intelligence,
enabling teams to actively share knowledge, build upon each other's ideas, and
achieve outcomes beyond individual contributions. Our study underscores the
value of co-exploration, suggesting that it reflects the trajectory of design
success and warrants further research. We also provide actionable insights,
equipping future practitioners with strategies to enhance co-exploration in
design collaborations.

TL;DR: 本研究结合沉浸式角色扮演游戏和LLM分析能力，探索用户在数字隐私领域的道德决策过程，通过GPT人类学家模型预测用户行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Floridi对硬伦理（塑造法律）和软伦理（个体道德偏好）的区分，研究旨在捕捉后者，即在法律允许的自由决策空间内的个体道德偏好。

Method: 采用基于人类学方法的角色扮演游戏，让参与者面对数字隐私领域的伦理困境场景，使用定制的LLM（GPT人类学家）分析收集的数据，并通过交叉验证评估模型。

Result: 评估显示数据丰富度和解释框架显著提升了模型预测用户行为的能力，LLM能有效自动化和增强对用户道德偏好及决策过程的理解。

Conclusion: LLM可以在软件开发早期阶段有效用于自动化和增强对用户道德偏好和决策过程的理解。

Abstract: This study investigates a novel approach to eliciting users' moral
decision-making by combining immersive roleplaying games with LLM analysis
capabilities. Building on the distinction introduced by Floridi between hard
ethics inspiring and shaping laws-and soft ethics-moral preferences guiding
individual behavior within the free space of decisions compliant to laws-we
focus on capturing the latter through contextrich, narrative-driven
interactions. Grounded in anthropological methods, the role-playing game
exposes participants to ethically charged scenarios in the domain of digital
privacy. Data collected during the sessions were interpreted by a customized
LLM ("GPT Anthropologist"). Evaluation through a cross-validation process shows
that both the richness of the data and the interpretive framing significantly
enhance the model's ability to predict user behavior. Results show that LLMs
can be effectively employed to automate and enhance the understanding of user
moral preferences and decision-making process in the early stages of software
development.

Abstract: Precise tracking of the jaw kinematics is crucial for diagnosing various
musculoskeletal and neuromuscular diseases affecting the masticatory system and
for advancing rehabilitative devices such as jaw exoskeletons, a hardly
explored research field, to treat these disorders. We introduce an open-source,
low-cost, precise, non-invasive, and biocompatible jaw tracking system based on
optical motion capture technology to address the need for accessible and
adaptable research tools. The system encompasses a complete pipeline from data
acquisition, processing, and kinematic analysis to filtering, visualization,
and data storage. We evaluated its performance and feasibility in experiments
with four participants executing various jaw movements. The system demonstrated
reliable kinematic tracking with an estimated precision of $(182 \pm 47)
{\mu}m$ and $(0.126 \pm 0.034) {\deg}$. Therefore, the open-source nature of
the system and its utility comparable to commercial systems make it suitable
for many research and development contexts, especially for applications such as
the integration and design of jaw exoskeletons and customized diagnostic
protocols. The complete system is available at GitHub with the aim of promoting
innovation in temporomandibular disorders research and jaw assistive
technology.

TL;DR: 该论文主张在老年人与机器人互动中模拟共情是实现满意社交、可信赖和道德互动的关键要素，指出当前设计忽视共情作为理论设计路径，并提出使用共情关怀词汇作为人形社交机器人的设计基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年人研究参与者接受机器人护理场景，但表达社交质量较差，当前人机交互设计在一定程度上忽视了将共情作为理论化设计路径，存在设计空白。

Method: 运用修辞理论定义令人信服的共情关系的社会文化期望，分析社会如何在话语交流中理解、重视和协商人类同伴间的共情互动，并使用两个机器人公共研究收藏（其中一个专门针对老年人的老年技术）来证实机器人公司公开材料中对共情的关注不足。

Result: 研究发现当前人机交互设计确实缺乏对共情的关注，共情作为社会价值系统在机器人设计中未得到充分体现，机器人公司的公开材料也证实了这一缺失。

Conclusion: 使用共情关怀词汇作为设计路径是设计支持老年人就地养老目标的人形社交机器人的有效基础，应审查情感AI在人-社交辅助机器人互动的社会技术组合中的整合，确保其基于涉及共情品质的真实文化价值观。

Abstract: The paper asserts that emulating empathy in human-robot interaction is a key
component to achieve satisfying social, trustworthy, and ethical robot
interaction with older people. Following comments from older adult study
participants, the paper identifies a gap. Despite the acceptance of robot care
scenarios, participants expressed the poor quality of the social aspect.
Current human-robot designs, to a certain extent, neglect to include empathy as
a theorized design pathway. Using rhetorical theory, this paper defines the
socio-cultural expectations for convincing empathetic relationships. It
analyzes and then summarizes how society understands, values, and negotiates
empathic interaction between human companions in discursive exchanges, wherein
empathy acts as a societal value system. Using two public research collections
on robots, with one geared specifically to gerontechnology for older people, it
substantiates the lack of attention to empathy in public materials produced by
robot companies. This paper contends that using an empathetic care vocabulary
as a design pathway is a productive underlying foundation for designing
humanoid social robots that aim to support older people's goals of
aging-in-place. It argues that the integration of affective AI into the
sociotechnical assemblages of human-socially assistive robot interaction ought
to be scrutinized to ensure it is based on genuine cultural values involving
empathetic qualities.

Motivation: 在低收入国家的农村地区，产科超声检查资源有限，需要解决助产士获取诊断相关胎儿图像的挑战。

Method: 开发了人机协作AI系统，包含分类模型和基于网络的异步专家审查平台，分析由经过简单培训的助产士使用低成本POCUS设备采集的盲扫视频。

Result: 系统在识别非专家采集的盲扫视频中标准胎儿平面方面表现出良好性能，现场评估显示可用性良好且认知负荷低。

Conclusion: 该系统有潜力扩大欠发达地区产前影像服务的可及性。

Abstract: Access to obstetric ultrasound is often limited in low-resource settings,
particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This work
proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to
assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind
sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a
web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key
frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate
on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its
performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained
midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were
analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard
fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good
usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to
expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代立法框架如ACA涉及复杂的机构、授权和相互依赖关系，政府发布的图表通常静态、密集且难以理解，即使是专家也难以解读。

Method: 通过整合数据提取、自然语言处理和计算机视觉技术，将静态政策图表转换为动态力导向图，支持对立法和监管框架的深度探索。

Result: 开发了LegiScout系统，能够增强对复杂立法结构的理解，同时保持基本关系不变。

Conclusion: 该方法使政策制定者、分析师和公众能够更好地导航和理解现代法律中的复杂性。

Abstract: Modern legislative frameworks, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often
involve complex webs of agencies, mandates, and interdependencies. Government
issued charts attempt to depict these structures but are typically static,
dense, and difficult to interpret - even for experts. We introduce LegiScout,
an interactive visualization system that transforms static policy diagrams into
dynamic, force-directed graphs, enhancing comprehension while preserving
essential relationships. By integrating data extraction, natural language
processing, and computer vision techniques, LegiScout supports deeper
exploration of not only the ACA but also a wide range of legislative and
regulatory frameworks. Our approach enables stakeholders - policymakers,
analysts, and the public - to navigate and understand the complexity inherent

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论图形局限于标准形状，限制了可视化理论的创造性和表达潜力，需要探索更具表现力的形状配置。

Method: 通过反思图形制作在理论实践中的生成作用，推测使用冰山、马蹄铁、莫比乌斯带和BLT三明治等更具表现力的形状来可视化理论的价值。

Result: 发现理论图形所使用的形状会影响对其基础现象的理解和解释，不同的形状配置能够提供不同的认知视角。

Conclusion: 理论本质上就是形状，图形制作在理论构建过程中扮演着生成性的重要角色。

Abstract: "Theory figures" are a staple of theoretical visualization research. Common
shapes such as Cartesian planes and flowcharts can be used not only to explain
conceptual contributions, but to think through and refine the contribution
itself. Yet, theory figures tend to be limited to a set of standard shapes,
limiting the creative and expressive potential of visualization theory. In this
work, we explore how the shapes used in theory figures afford different
understandings and explanations of their underlying phenomena. We speculate on
the value of visualizing theories using more expressive configurations, such as
icebergs, horseshoes, M\"obius strips, and BLT sandwiches. By reflecting on
figure-making's generative role in the practice of theorizing, we conclude that
theory is, in fact, shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 命令行提供了强大功能但需要用户记忆文本语法和查阅文档，而图形界面让用户能够通过控件和菜单自然地发现和调用操作。作者希望更好地暴露命令行的能力。

Method: 通过AI将命令行工具的man页面文档翻译成界面规范，然后基于这些规范生成图形用户界面。

Result: 在命令语料库上评估生成的界面，显示GUIde能够为用户的实际命令行任务提供全面的图形界面。

Conclusion: GUIde成功地通过AI自动从man文档生成图形界面，使命令行功能更易于访问和使用。

Abstract: Although birthed in the era of teletypes, the command line shell survived the
graphical interface revolution of the 1980's and lives on in modern desktop
operating systems. The command line provides access to powerful functionality
not otherwise exposed on the computer, but requires users to recall textual
syntax and carefully scour documentation. In contrast, graphical interfaces let
users organically discover and invoke possible actions through widgets and
menus. To better expose the power of the command line, we demonstrate a
mechanism for automatically creating graphical interfaces for command line
tools by translating their documentation (in the form of man pages) into
interface specifications via AI. Using these specifications, our user-facing
system, called GUIde, presents the command options to the user graphically. We
evaluate the generated interfaces on a corpus of commands to show to what
degree GUIde offers thorough graphical interfaces for users' real-world command
line tasks.

TL;DR: 研究人员对使用LLM进行数据发现持保留态度，尽管LLM能解决传统关键词匹配的问题，但透明性等障碍需要克服才能提高接受度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据发现方法依赖精确的关键词匹配，这要求研究人员知道前人使用的确切术语，可能导致遗漏相关数据。LLM有望通过自然语言查询解决这一问题，但研究人员是否接受LLM用于数据发现尚不明确。

Method: 采用以人为中心的人工智能方法，进行了焦点小组研究（N=27），了解研究人员对LLM用于数据发现的看法，并构建了概念模型。

Result: 概念模型显示，仅凭潜在好处不足以让研究人员用LLM替代现有技术。存在阻碍研究人员完全接受LLM的障碍，但透明性相关功能可以克服这些障碍。

Conclusion: 通过该模型，开发者可以整合相关功能，提高研究人员对LLM用于数据发现的接受度。

Abstract: Current approaches to data discovery match keywords between metadata and
queries. This matching requires researchers to know the exact wording that
other researchers previously used, creating a challenging process that could
lead to missing relevant data. Large Language Models (LLMs) could enhance data
discovery by removing this requirement and allowing researchers to ask
questions with natural language. However, we do not currently know if
researchers would accept LLMs for data discovery. Using a human-centered
artificial intelligence (HCAI) focus, we ran focus groups (N = 27) to
understand researchers' perspectives towards LLMs for data discovery. Our
conceptual model shows that the potential benefits are not enough for
researchers to use LLMs instead of current technology. Barriers prevent
researchers from fully accepting LLMs, but features around transparency could
overcome them. Using our model will allow developers to incorporate features
that result in an increased acceptance of LLMs for data discovery.

TL;DR: AI辅助虽然能短期提高假新闻检测准确率，但长期来看会削弱人们独立识别虚假信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着虚假信息日益普遍，特别是AI生成的逼真假新闻，迫切需要训练人们更好地评估和检测错误信息。

Method: 进行为期一个月的研究，67名参与者对新闻标题-图片配对进行真伪分类，与AI系统讨论评估，然后在无AI协助下评估未见过的新闻项目，测量AI协助前、中、后的准确性。

Result: AI协助在AI辅助会话期间产生即时改进（平均+21%），但参与者对新闻项目的无协助表现在第4周显著下降（-15.3%）。

Conclusion: 虽然AI可能立即提供帮助，但最终会削弱长期错误信息检测能力。

Abstract: Given the growing prevalence of fake information, including increasingly
realistic AI-generated news, there is an urgent need to train people to better
evaluate and detect misinformation. While interactions with AI have been shown
to durably reduce people's beliefs in false information, it is unclear whether
these interactions also teach people the skills to discern false information
themselves. We conducted a month-long study where 67 participants classified
news headline-image pairs as real or fake, discussed their assessments with an
AI system, followed by an unassisted evaluation of unseen news items to measure
accuracy before, during, and after AI assistance. While AI assistance produced
immediate improvements during AI-assisted sessions (+21\% average),
participants' unassisted performance on new items declined significantly by
week 4 (-15.3\%). These results indicate that while AI may help immediately, it
ultimately degrades long-term misinformation detection abilities.

TL;DR: EvolveCaptions是一个实时协作的ASR适应系统，通过听力参与者在对话中纠正ASR错误，生成针对性的语音提示让DHH用户录制少量语音，从而快速个性化优化ASR模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR系统对聋人和听力障碍者的语音识别准确率低，传统个性化方法需要大量预录音数据且将适应负担完全放在DHH用户身上。

Method: 在实时对话中，听力参与者纠正ASR错误，系统基于这些纠正生成短小、针对性的语音提示，让DHH用户录制少量语音样本，用于微调ASR模型。

Result: 在12名DHH和6名听力参与者的研究中，系统在一小时内将WER降低了所有DHH用户，平均仅需5分钟录音时间。参与者认为系统直观、低负担且易于集成到沟通中。

Conclusion: 协作式实时ASR适应为实现更公平的沟通展示了良好前景。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often fail to accurately
transcribe speech from Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals, especially
during real-time conversations. Existing personalization approaches typically
require extensive pre-recorded data and place the burden of adaptation on the
DHH speaker. We present EvolveCaptions, a real-time, collaborative ASR
adaptation system that supports in-situ personalization with minimal effort.
Hearing participants correct ASR errors during live conversations. Based on
these corrections, the system generates short, phonetically targeted prompts
for the DHH speaker to record, which are then used to fine-tune the ASR model.
In a study with 12 DHH and six hearing participants, EvolveCaptions reduced
Word Error Rate (WER) across all DHH users within one hour of use, using only
five minutes of recording time on average. Participants described the system as
intuitive, low-effort, and well-integrated into communication. These findings
demonstrate the promise of collaborative, real-time ASR adaptation for more
equitable communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AR环境中注视序列的不规则分散和系统偏差问题，这些偏差由人类眼动生理、AR头显跟踪精度不足和环境干扰共同导致，影响了交互性能和视觉参与度。

Method: 将注视稳定重新定义为序列到序列的时间回归问题，从搜索阶段的历史注视动态预测目标注视阶段的理想注视轨迹。采用合成数据生成和混合策略，产生与任务目标对齐的空间集中、目标中心的注视参考。

Result: 在54名参与者通过Microsoft HoloLens 2收集的真实和增强注视序列混合数据集上训练评估，统计结果显示TimeGazer显著提高交互准确性并减少完成时间。

Conclusion: 预测性注视稳定的时间建模可以增强任务驱动AR交互中的注意力一致性和响应性，TimeGazer在推进自适应注视界面和沉浸系统中时间建模研究方面具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Gaze stabilization is critical for enabling fluid, accurate, and efficient
interaction in immersive augmented reality (AR) environments, particularly
during task-oriented visual behaviors. However, fixation sequences captured in
active gaze tasks often exhibit irregular dispersion and systematic deviations
from target locations, a variability primarily caused by the combined effects
of human oculomotor physiology, insufficient AR headset tracking and
calibration accuracy, and environmental disturbances, undermining interaction
performance and visual engagement. To address this issue, we propose TimeGazer,
which reformulates gaze stabilization as a sequence-to-sequence temporal
regression problem, predicting idealized fixation trajectories for the
target-fixation phase from historical gaze dynamics in the search phase. We
present a synthetic data generation and blending strategy that produces
spatially concentrated, target-centered fixation references aligned with task
objectives, substantially enriching the training space and enhancing model
generalization. We train and evaluate TimeGazer on a hybrid dataset of real and
augmented gaze sequences collected via Microsoft HoloLens 2 from 54
participants across multiple prediction horizons. Through the user study,
statistical results demonstrate that TimeGazer significantly improves
interaction accuracy and reduces completion time, confirming that temporal
modeling of predictive gaze stabilization can strengthen attentional
consistency and responsiveness in task-driven AR interaction. These findings
highlight the broader potential of TimeGazer for advancing adaptive gaze-based
interfaces and temporal modeling research in immersive systems.

Method: 对来自法律、医疗和金融等行业的24名高技能知识工作者进行半结构化访谈。

Result: 专家们普遍担忧敏感信息泄露、知识产权侵权和模型输出质量不确定性，并自发采取数据扭曲、限制提示细节等缓解策略，但这些策略因缺乏专门的合规指导和培训而效果有限。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前NLP工具与专家实际合规需求之间的显著差距，为构建下一代以人为中心、合规驱动的自然语言处理监管技术提供了重要基础，为工程化NLP系统提供了关键的人类中心视角和设计要求。

Abstract: Large Language Models are profoundly changing work patterns in high-risk
professional domains, yet their application also introduces severe and
underexplored compliance risks. To investigate this issue, we conducted
semi-structured interviews with 24 highly-skilled knowledge workers from
industries such as law, healthcare, and finance. The study found that these
experts are commonly concerned about sensitive information leakage,
intellectual property infringement, and uncertainty regarding the quality of
model outputs. In response, they spontaneously adopt various mitigation
strategies, such as actively distorting input data and limiting the details in
their prompts. However, the effectiveness of these spontaneous efforts is
limited due to a lack of specific compliance guidance and training for Large
Language Models. Our research reveals a significant gap between current NLP
tools and the actual compliance needs of experts. This paper positions these
valuable empirical findings as foundational work for building the next
generation of Human-Centered, Compliance-Driven Natural Language Processing for
Regulatory Technology (RegTech), providing a critical human-centered
perspective and design requirements for engineering NLP systems that can
proactively support expert compliance workflows.

*Samantha Stedtler,Marianna Leventi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文指出传统归责实践无法捕捉道德经验的复杂性，机器人可能强化社会群体刻板印象，并呼吁机器人专家关注社会特征的实现方式，建议"拥抱故障"来建设性破坏实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统归责实践忽视了权力动态和歧视性社会实践，机器人可能强化社会群体刻板印象并导致弱势群体被不成比例地归责，且存在从人机交互到人际交互的潜在溢出效应。

Method: 采用理论分析和实证研究相结合的方法，探讨机器人如何体现特定社会群体角色及其对归责实践的影响。

Result: 发现机器人可能强化社会刻板印象，建立规范性和描述性标准，并可能导致弱势群体在机器人出错时被不成比例地归责。

Conclusion: 呼吁机器人专家持续关注社会特征的概念化和实现方式，建议通过"拥抱故障"来建设性破坏实践，并需要更多关于机器人刻板印象和归责后果的研究。

Abstract: This paper argues that conventional blame practices fall short of capturing
the complexity of moral experiences, neglecting power dynamics and
discriminatory social practices. It is evident that robots, embodying roles
linked to specific social groups, pose a risk of reinforcing stereotypes of how
these groups behave or should behave, so they set a normative and descriptive
standard. In addition, we argue that faulty robots might create expectations of
who is supposed to compensate and repair after their errors, where social
groups that are already disadvantaged might be blamed disproportionately if
they do not act according to their ascribed roles. This theoretical and
empirical gap becomes even more urgent to address as there have been
indications of potential carryover effects from Human-Robot Interactions (HRI)
to Human-Human Interactions (HHI). We therefore urge roboticists and designers
to stay in an ongoing conversation about how social traits are conceptualised
and implemented in this technology. We also argue that one solution could be to
'embrace the glitch' and to focus on constructively disrupting practices
instead of prioritizing efficiency and smoothness of interaction above
everything else. Apart from considering ethical aspects in the design phase of
social robots, we see our analysis as a call for more research on the
consequences of robot stereotyping and blame attribution.

### [153] [Komitee Equal Shares: Choosing Together as Voters and as Groups with a Co-designed Virtual Budget Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02040)
*Joshua C. Yang,Noemi Scheurer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Komitee Equal Shares是一个可定价的虚拟预算分配框架，整合了投票模式和评估模式两种信号，通过将信号转化为虚拟支出能力并生成投票收据，在瑞士温特图尔的文化委员会中部署应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共资金分配过程需要公平性、学习性和参与者可理解的结果。现有社会选择方法通常将参与式预算视为偏好聚合，但公民也认为自己是评估者，这一差距需要解决。

Method: 扩展Equal Shares方法，整合两种信号：投票模式下参与者投点票；评估模式下小组根据集体定义的impact领域评估提案。将信号转化为虚拟支出能力并生成投票收据。

Result: 在2025年瑞士温特图尔文化委员会中成功部署该框架，实现了决策模式的清晰分离，并通过投票收据使比例分配可读且可追溯。

Conclusion: 该框架可推广到参与式资助和预算制定，提供了一个公民在单一比例可解释分配中同时作为投票者和评估者的模型。

Abstract: Public funding processes demand fairness, learning, and outcomes that
participants can understand. We introduce Komitee Equal Shares, a priceable
virtual-budget allocation framework that integrates two signals: in voter mode,
participants cast point votes; in evaluator mode, small groups assess proposals
against collectively defined impact fields. The framework extends the Method of
Equal Shares by translating both signals into virtual spending power and
producing voting receipts. We deployed the framework in the 2025 Kultur Komitee
in Winterthur, Switzerland. Our contributions are: (1) a clear separation of
decision modes, addressing a gap in social choice that typically treats
participatory budgeting as preference aggregation while citizens also see
themselves as evaluators; and (2) the design of voting receipts that
operationalise priceability into participant-facing explanations, making
proportional allocations legible and traceable. The framework generalises to
participatory grant-making and budgeting, offering a model where citizens act
as voters and evaluators within one proportional, explainable allocation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨人们如何理解机器人顾问角色并将其建议整合到决策中，发现人们对RA的依赖受绩效信息和收益/损失框架影响，识别了三种RA角色和四种用户类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人顾问作为成本效益高、偏见少的替代方案，但采用率有限。现有研究较少关注人们如何理解RA角色并整合其建议到决策中。

Method: 采用多阶段混合方法设计，包括行为实验（N=334）、主题分析和后续定量测试。

Result: 研究发现人们对RA的依赖受绩效信息和收益/损失框架影响，识别了三种RA决策角色和四种用户类型，以及2x2分类法将接受因素分为个体和算法层面的促进因素和抑制因素。

Conclusion: 通过结合行为、解释性和验证性证据，本研究增进了对人-RA协作的理解，为设计更可信和适应性强的RA系统提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Robo-advisors (RAs) are cost-effective, bias-resistant alternatives to human
financial advisors, yet adoption remains limited. While prior research has
examined user interactions with RAs, less is known about how individuals
interpret RA roles and integrate their advice into decision-making. To address
this gap, this study employs a multiphase mixed methods design integrating a
behavioral experiment (N = 334), thematic analysis, and follow-up quantitative
testing. Findings suggest that people tend to rely on RAs, with reliance shaped
by information about RA performance and the framing of advice as gains or
losses. Thematic analysis reveals three RA roles in decision-making and four
user types, each reflecting distinct patterns of advice integration. In
addition, a 2 x 2 typology categorizes antecedents of acceptance into enablers
and inhibitors at both the individual and algorithmic levels. By combining
behavioral, interpretive, and confirmatory evidence, this study advances
understanding of human-RA collaboration and provides actionable insights for
designing more trustworthy and adaptive RA systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VIS-ReAct是一个两智能体框架，通过分析视觉工作空间中的新语义交互来指导LLM进行报告精炼，在针对性精炼、语义保真度和透明推理方面优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在基于人类视觉工作空间表示生成初始报告方面表现出潜力，但在精炼过程中难以精确整合顺序语义交互。

Method: 引入VIS-ReAct框架，包含两个智能体：主要LLM分析智能体解释新语义交互以推断用户意图并生成精炼计划，然后是LLM精炼智能体相应地更新报告。

Result: 通过案例研究，VIS-ReAct在针对性精炼、语义保真度和透明推理方面优于基线和无LLM分析的VIS-ReAct变体。

Conclusion: VIS-ReAct能更好地处理各种交互类型和粒度，同时增强人类-LLM协作的透明度。

Abstract: Sensemaking report writing often requires multiple refinements in the
iterative process. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
generating initial reports based on human visual workspace representations,
they struggle to precisely incorporate sequential semantic interactions during
the refinement process. We introduce VIS-ReAct, a framework that reasons about
newly-added semantic interactions in visual workspaces to steer the LLM for
report refinement.
  VIS-ReAct is a two-agent framework: a primary LLM analysis agent interprets
new semantic interactions to infer user intentions and generate refinement
planning, followed by an LLM refinement agent that updates reports accordingly.
Through case study, VIS-ReAct outperforms baseline and VIS-ReAct (without LLM
analysis) on targeted refinement, semantic fidelity, and transparent inference.
Results demonstrate that VIS-ReAct better handles various interaction types and
granularities while enhancing the transparency of human-LLM collaboration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黑板架构的多智能体通信范式，用于解决大型异构数据湖中的数据发现问题，相比传统方法显著提升了任务成功率和数据发现性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大型异构数据湖时存在局限性：单智能体系统难以应对大规模文件，而基于主从模式的多智能体系统需要中央控制器精确了解每个子智能体的能力。

Method: 受传统AI模型中黑板架构启发，设计了一种多智能体通信框架：中央智能体将请求发布到共享黑板，负责数据湖分区或通用信息检索的自主子智能体根据自身能力主动响应。

Result: 在三个需要显式数据发现的基准测试上，黑板架构显著优于基线方法（包括RAG和主从多智能体范式），端到端任务成功率相对提升13%-57%，数据发现的F1分数相对提升最高达9%。

Conclusion: 黑板范式被确立为多智能体系统中可扩展且可泛化的通信框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均衡模型因可处理性限制而异质性不足，传统基于智能体的模型依赖手工决策规则，需要更灵活、自适应且透明的宏观经济模拟方法。

Method: 使用LLMs构建包含家庭、企业、中央银行和政府四类核心智能体的多智能体系统，在摩擦性劳动力市场、异质化商品市场和金融市场中进行交互，并利用视觉语言模型确定企业地理位置和渲染虚拟城市。

Result: SimCity能够自然重现价格需求弹性、恩格尔定律、奥肯定律、菲利普斯曲线和贝弗里奇曲线等经典宏观经济现象，并在多次模拟中保持稳健性。

Conclusion: LLMs为构建现实且可解释的宏观经济模拟开辟了新可能性，SimCity框架成功地将异质化智能体与丰富交互结合，为研究宏观经济规律和城市扩张动态提供了统一环境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) open new possibilities for constructing
realistic and interpretable macroeconomic simulations. We present SimCity, a
multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to model an interpretable
macroeconomic system with heterogeneous agents and rich interactions. Unlike
classical equilibrium models that limit heterogeneity for tractability, or
traditional agent-based models (ABMs) that rely on hand-crafted decision rules,
SimCity enables flexible, adaptive behavior with transparent natural-language
reasoning. Within SimCity, four core agent types (households, firms, a central
bank, and a government) deliberate and participate in a frictional labor
market, a heterogeneous goods market, and a financial market. Furthermore, a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) determines the geographic placement of new firms
and renders a mapped virtual city, allowing us to study both macroeconomic
regularities and urban expansion dynamics within a unified environment. To
evaluate the framework, we compile a checklist of canonical macroeconomic
phenomena, including price elasticity of demand, Engel's Law, Okun's Law, the
Phillips Curve, and the Beveridge Curve, and show that SimCity naturally
reproduces these empirical patterns while remaining robust across simulation
runs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种算法(Kalman-UCB和IDEA)来解决线性高斯动态系统中的探索-利用权衡问题，并提供了一个基于系统特性的性能预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大型动作空间(如机器学习超参数优化)中，基于乐观原则的方法需要探索每个动作而导致性能下降的问题。

Method: Kalman-UCB使用面对不确定性的乐观原则，IDEA选择最大化预测奖励与最小化卡尔曼滤波器状态预测误差组合的动作。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了基于LGDS特性的性能预测指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的算法和性能预测指标能够有效解决线性高斯动态系统中的探索-利用权衡问题，特别是在大型动作空间场景下。

Abstract: The paper introduces a linear bandit environment where the reward is the
output of a known Linear Gaussian Dynamical System (LGDS). In this environment,
we address the fundamental challenge of balancing exploration -- gathering
information about the environment -- and exploitation -- selecting to the
action with the highest predicted reward. We propose two algorithms, Kalman
filter Upper Confidence Bound (Kalman-UCB) and Information filter Directed
Exploration Action-selection (IDEA). Kalman-UCB uses the principle of optimism
in the face of uncertainty. IDEA selects actions that maximize the combination
of the predicted reward and a term that quantifies how much an action minimizes
the error of the Kalman filter state prediction, which depends on the LGDS
property called observability. IDEA is motivated by applications such as
hyperparameter optimization in machine learning. A major problem encountered in
hyperparameter optimization is the large action spaces, which hinder the
performance of methods inspired by principle of optimism in the face of
uncertainty as they need to explore each action to lower reward prediction
uncertainty. To predict if either Kalman-UCB or IDEA will perform better, a
metric based on the LGDS properties is provided. This metric is validated with
numerical results across a variety of randomly generated environments.

Motivation: 解决非线性系统在数字孪生模型不完美情况下的安全部署问题，建立系统化的安全认证框架，确保学习型控制的安全性。

Method: 融合数字孪生标称轨迹与在线数据驱动不确定性量化，通过数据驱动边界捕获系统偏差，使用时间序列数据构建线性矩阵不等式合成二次漏斗控制器，采用分段学习策略。

Result: 开发出能够保证约束满足的鲁棒跟踪控制器，通过分段学习适应真实系统行为，为不完美模型下的非线性系统学习控制提供安全认证。

Conclusion: 建立了一个系统化框架，为具有不完美模型的非线性系统的学习型控制提供安全证书，实现了数字孪生与实际系统之间的安全融合。

Abstract: This paper examines a robust data-driven approach for the safe deployment of
systems with nonlinear dynamics using their imperfect digital twins. Our
contribution involves proposing a method that fuses the digital twin's nominal
trajectory with online, data-driven uncertainty quantification to synthesize
robust tracking controllers. Specifically, we derive data-driven bounds to
capture the deviations of the actual system from its prescribed nominal
trajectory informed via its digital twin. Subsequently, the dataset is used in
the synthesis of quadratic funnels -- robust positive invariant tubes around
the nominal trajectory -- via linear matrix inequalities built on the
time-series data. The resulting controller guarantees constraint satisfaction
while adapting to the true system behavior through a segmented learning
strategy, where each segment's controller is synthesized using uncertainty
information from the previous segment. This work establishes a systematic
framework for obtaining safety certificates in learning-based control of
nonlinear systems with imperfect models.

Motivation: 解决竞争空域中的关键空中防御挑战，确保高价值无人机在动态不确定环境下免受敌对无人机威胁。

Method: 采用时间约束制导框架和真比例导引方法，构建逃避者-防御者协同制导策略，不依赖追击者策略信息。

Result: 从任意初始几何构型出发，关键交战误差在固定时间内收敛到零，成功完成防御任务，在各种对抗场景下验证有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为竞争空域环境下的实时自主防御提供了可靠解决方案，具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和实时性优势。

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical aerial defense challenge in contested
airspace, involving three autonomous aerial vehicles -- a hostile drone (the
pursuer), a high-value drone (the evader), and a protective drone (the
defender). We present a cooperative guidance framework for the evader-defender
team that guarantees interception of the pursuer before it can capture the
evader, even under highly dynamic and uncertain engagement conditions. Unlike
traditional heuristic, optimal control, or differential game-based methods, we
approach the problem within a time-constrained guidance framework, leveraging
true proportional navigation based approach that ensures robust and guaranteed
solutions to the aerial defense problem. The proposed strategy is
computationally lightweight, scalable to a large number of agent
configurations, and does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy or
control laws. From arbitrary initial geometries, our method guarantees that key
engagement errors are driven to zero within a fixed time, leading to a
successful mission. Extensive simulations across diverse and adversarial
scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its relevance
for real-time autonomous defense in contested airspace environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于庞加莱引理的IDA-PBC变体方法，用于设计二维系统的输出反馈全局稳定控制器，将传统方法中的偏微分方程替换为更易求解的常微分方程，并应用于DC-DC变换器的电压反馈控制。

Motivation: 传统IDA-PBC方法因需要求解复杂的匹配偏微分方程而应用受限，需要开发更简单有效的控制器设计方法。

Method: 基于庞加莱引理改进IDA-PBC，将匹配PDE替换为ODE，构建输出反馈全局稳定控制器，并为不确定负载情况开发自适应版本。

Result: 成功应用于Buck、Boost和Buck-Boost三种典型DC-DC变换器的电压反馈控制，在负载变化情况下实现稳定调节，数值仿真和实验结果验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法简化了控制器设计过程，提高了实用性，特别适用于电力电子变换器的输出反馈控制应用。

Abstract: In this paper we propose a variation of the widely popular
Interconnection-and-Damping-Assigment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) based
on Poincare's Lemma to design output feedback globally stabilizing controllers
for two dimensional systems. The procedure is constructive and, in comparison
with the classical IDA-PBC, whose application is often stymied by the need to
solve the (infamous) matching partial differential equation (PDE), in this new
method the PDE is replaced by an ordinary differential equation, whose solution
is far simpler. The procedure is then applied for the design of
voltage-feedback controllers for the three most typical DC-to-DC power
converter topologies: the Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost. It is assumed that these
converters feed an uncertain load, which is characterized by a static relation
between its voltage and current. In the case when the load consists of the
parallel connection of a resistive term and a constant power load we propose an
adaptive version of the design, adding an identification scheme for the load
parameters. This allows the controller to regulate the converter output when
the load varies-that is a typical scenario in these applications. Extensive
numerical simulations and experimental results validate the approach.

TL;DR: 该研究在真实住宅环境中比较了模型预测控制(MPC)和基于模型的强化学习(RL)在HVAC系统控制中的表现，发现RL虽然能减少工程开销，但在模型精度和操作鲁棒性方面存在实际权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC虽然能为HVAC系统带来显著节能效果，但需要大量工程努力，限制了可扩展性；RL承诺更高的自动化和适应性，但在实际住宅环境中的应用仍面临安全、可解释性和样本效率等挑战。

Method: 在印第安纳州西拉法叶的一个有住户的住宅中，分别部署MPC和基于模型的RL控制器各一个月，与现有控制器进行直接比较，评估可扩展性同时确保安全性和可比性。

Result: RL实现了显著的节能效果（相对于现有控制器节省22%），略高于MPC的节能效果（20%），但带来了稍高的住户不适感。当根据舒适度水平对节能效果进行归一化时，MPC表现出更优的性能。

Conclusion: 虽然RL减少了工程开销，但在模型精度和操作鲁棒性方面引入了实际权衡。关键经验教训包括安全控制器初始化的困难、控制动作与实际实施之间的不匹配问题，以及在实时环境中保持在线学习完整性的挑战。

Abstract: Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) offer
significant energy savings for HVAC systems but often require substantial
engineering effort, limiting scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises
greater automation and adaptability, yet its practical application in
real-world residential settings remains largely undemonstrated, facing
challenges related to safety, interpretability, and sample efficiency. To
investigate these practical issues, we performed a direct comparison of an MPC
and a model-based RL controller, with each controller deployed for a one-month
period in an occupied house with a heat pump system in West Lafayette, Indiana.
This investigation aimed to explore scalability of the chosen RL and MPC
implementations while ensuring safety and comparability. The advanced
controllers were evaluated against each other and against the existing
controller. RL achieved substantial energy savings (22\% relative to the
existing controller), slightly exceeding MPC's savings (20\%), albeit with
modestly higher occupant discomfort. However, when energy savings were
normalized for the level of comfort provided, MPC demonstrated superior
performance. This study's empirical results show that while RL reduces
engineering overhead, it introduces practical trade-offs in model accuracy and
operational robustness. The key lessons learned concern the difficulties of
safe controller initialization, navigating the mismatch between control actions
and their practical implementation, and maintaining the integrity of online
learning in a live environment. These insights pinpoint the essential research
directions needed to advance RL from a promising concept to a truly scalable
HVAC control solution.

Result: 仿真结果表明所提出的控制设计能够在外部干扰下跟踪复杂轨迹，系统具有稳定性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的CCM+UDE框架为无人机吊挂载荷系统提供了一种有效的鲁棒控制方案，能够实现零轨迹跟踪误差并处理控制输入饱和约束。

Abstract: This paper presents a robust neural control design for a three-drone slung
payload transportation system to track a reference path under external
disturbances. The control contraction metric (CCM) is used to generate a neural
exponentially converging baseline controller while complying with control input
saturation constraints. We also incorporate the uncertainty and disturbance
estimator (UDE) technique to dynamically compensate for persistent
disturbances. The proposed framework yields a modularized design, allowing the
controller and estimator to perform their individual tasks and achieve a zero
trajectory tracking error if the disturbances meet certain assumptions. The
stability and robustness of the complete system, incorporating both the CCM
controller and the UDE compensator, are presented. Simulations are conducted to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed control design to follow complicated
trajectories under external disturbances.

Conclusion: RSGF-RL算法在理论上保证了任意时间的安全性和渐近收敛性，在实际应用中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of solving constrained reinforcement
learning (RL) problems with anytime guarantees, meaning that the algorithmic
solution must yield a constraint-satisfying policy at every iteration of its
evolution. Our design is based on a discretization of the Robust Safe Gradient
Flow (RSGF), a continuous-time dynamics for anytime constrained optimization
whose forward invariance and stability properties we formally characterize. The
proposed strategy, termed RSGF-RL, is an off-policy algorithm which uses
episodic data to estimate the value functions and their gradients and updates
the policy parameters by solving a convex quadratically constrained quadratic
program. Our technical analysis combines statistical analysis, the theory of
stochastic approximation, and convex analysis to determine the number of
episodes sufficient to ensure that safe policies are updated to safe policies
and to recover from an unsafe policy, both with an arbitrary user-specified
probability, and to establish the asymptotic convergence to the set of KKT
points of the RL problem almost surely. Simulations on a navigation example and
the cart-pole system illustrate the superior performance of RSGF-RL with
respect to the state of the art.

Conclusion: 概率CBF方法能够为随机系统提供有限时间步内的概率安全保证，适用于多种实际场景

Abstract: Control systems operating in the real world face countless sources of
unpredictable uncertainties. These random disturbances can render deterministic
guarantees inapplicable and cause catastrophic safety failures. To overcome
this, this paper proposes a method for designing safe controllers for
discrete-time stochastic systems that retain probabilistic guarantees of
safety. To do this we modify the traditional notion of a control barrier
function (CBF) to explicitly account for these stochastic uncertainties and
call these new modified functions probabilistic CBFs. We show that
probabilistic CBFs can be used to design controllers that guarantee safety over
a finite number of time steps with a prescribed probability. Next, by
leveraging various uncertainty quantification methods, such as concentration
inequalities, the scenario approach, and conformal prediction, we provide a
variety of sufficient conditions that result in computationally tractable
controllers with tunable probabilistic guarantees across a plethora of
practical scenarios. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our results in
simulation and hardware for the control of a quadruped robot.

Abstract: Complex, interconnected cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasingly
prevalent in domains such as power systems. Cyber-resilient architectures have
been proposed to recover compromised cyber components of CPS. Recent works have
studied tuning the recovery times of such architectures to guarantee safety in
single-system settings. Extending these designs to interconnected CPS is more
challenging, since solutions must account for attacks on multiple subsystems
that can occur in any order and potentially infinite possible temporal overlap.
This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenge by developing a
scalable framework to assign resilient architectures and to inform the tuning
of their recovery times. Our approach introduces a scalar index that quantifies
the impact of each subsystem on safety under compromised input. These indices
aggregate linearly across subsystems, enabling scalable analysis under
arbitrary attack orderings and temporal overlaps. We establish a linear
inequality relating each subsystem's index and recovery time that guarantees
safety and guides resilient architecture assignment. We also propose a
segmentation-based approach to strengthen the previously derived conditions. We
then present algorithms to compute the proposed indices and to find a
cost-optimal architecture assignment with a safety guarantee. We validate the
framework through a case study on temperature regulation in interconnected
rooms under different attack scenarios.

Abstract: We study the stability of opinion dynamics in the time-varying
Friedkin-Johnsen (TVFJ) model, which captures both persistent individual biases
and adaptive social influence. We introduce two temporal structures, defected
temporal graphs (DTGs) and weakly defected temporal graphs (WDTGs), that serve
as graph-theoretic certificates linking stubborn influence and temporal
connectivity to contraction of the state-transition matrix. Using these tools,
we prove asymptotic stability of TVFJ dynamics under infinitely recurring DTGs,
exponential stability in semi-periodic defected networks, and asymptotic
stability of a trust-based extension under the weaker condition of recurring
WDTGs. We also establish boundedness of the omega-limit set, showing that
long-run opinions remain within the convex hull of innate beliefs, and
characterize the limit set for periodically switching systems via a p-LTI
decomposition with the tight bound that the size of the omega-limit set is at
most p. Finally, we show that exponential stability persists under bounded
perturbations, ensuring robustness in noisy or imperfect networks. These
results unify algebraic contraction tests with interpretable graph-based
reasoning, providing scalable and resilient tools for analyzing opinion
formation in evolving social and human-AI networks.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一种基于交流最优潮流的三维PQV可行运行区域构建方法，通过两阶段采样策略和隐式多项式拟合实现隐私保护的TSO-DSO协调，显著降低计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着配电系统灵活性在输电网管理中的重要性增加，数据隐私问题阻碍了无缝互操作性。PQ域中的可行运行区域概念成为有前景的隐私保护方法，但其在TSO操作中的有效利用面临准确确定、可处理分析和经济估值三大挑战。

Method: 提出基于AC最优潮流的三维PQV-FOR构建方法，采用两阶段采样策略（边界框投影和斐波那契方向技术）高效捕获FOR，引入隐式多项式拟合进行解析表示，并推导PQV域上的二次成本函数。

Result: 在最多533个节点的网状配电系统测试中，与传统AC-OPF相比，该方法平均成本偏差最大仅0.058%，计算时间减少高达58.11%。

Conclusion: 所提框架支持单轮TSO-DSO协调：DSO提供解析FOR和成本模型，TSO在基于FOR的AC-OPF中确定公共连接点运行点，DSO通过本地OPF计算灵活性提供单元调度，无需计算密集的解聚或迭代协调。

Abstract: As the role of distribution system (DS) flexibility in transmission system
operator (TSO) network management becomes increasingly vital, data privacy
concerns hinder seamless interoperability. The notion of the feasible operating
region (FOR), defined in the PQ domain, has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving approach. However, effectively leveraging FOR in TSO
operations remains challenging due to three key factors: its accurate
determination in large-scale, meshed DS networks; its tractable analytical
representation; and its economic valuation. In the present paper, we propose a
novel AC optimal power flow (OPF)-based method to construct a three-dimensional
PQV-FOR, explicitly accounting for voltage variability and diverse
flexibility-providing unit (FPU) characteristics. The construction process
employs a two-stage sampling strategy that combines bounding box projection and
Fibonacci direction techniques to efficiently capture the FOR. We then
introduce an implicit polynomial fitting approach to analytically represent the
FOR. Furthermore, we derive a quadratic cost function over the PQV domain to
monetize the FOR. Thus, the proposed framework enables single-round TSO-DSO
coordination: the DSO provides an analytical FOR and cost model; the TSO
determines operating point at the point of common coupling (PCC) within the
FOR-based AC-OPF; and the DSO computes FPU dispatch by solving its local OPF,
without computationally intensive disaggregation or iterative coordination.
Case studies on meshed DS with up to 533 buses, integrated into TS,
demonstrates the method's efficiency compared to standard AC-OPF. On average,
the proposed approach yields negligible cost deviations of at most 0.058%
across test cases, while reducing computation times by up to 58.11%.

Conclusion: 该方法为协调自适应巡航控制提供了新的表述方式，将交通控制问题转化为机制设计问题，所有车辆在激励兼容的基础上平等参与。

Abstract: Within the modeling framework of Markov games, we propose a series of
algorithms for coordinated car-following using distributed model predictive
control (DMPC). Instead of tracking prescribed feasible trajectories, driving
policies are solved directly as outcomes of the DMPC optimization given the
driver's perceivable states. The coordinated solutions are derived using the
best response dynamics via iterated self-play, and are facilitated by direct
negotiation using inter-agent or agent-infrastructure communication. These
solutions closely approximate either Nash equilibrium or centralized
optimization. By re-parameterizing the action sequence in DMPC as a curve along
the planning horizon, we are able to systematically reduce the original DMPC to
very efficient grid searches such that the optimal solution to the original
DMPC can be well executed in real-time. Within our modeling framework, it is
natural to cast traffic control problems as mechanism design problems, in which
all agents are endogenized on an equal footing with full incentive
compatibility. We show how traffic efficiency can be dramatically improved
while keeping stop-and-go phantom waves tamed at high vehicle densities. Our
approach can be viewed as an alternative way to formulate coordinated adaptive
cruise control (CACC) without an explicit platooning (or with all vehicles in
the traffic system treated as a single extended platoon). We also address the
issue of linear stability of the associated discrete-time traffic dynamics and
demonstrate why it does not always tell the full story about the traffic
stability.

Conclusion: 结合TOD调度协议和事件触发机制能有效优化SMMS遥操作系统的网络带宽和能耗，同时保证系统稳定性和主从同步性能。

Abstract: Single-master multi-slave (SMMS) teleoperation systems can perform multiple
tasks remotely in a shorter time, cover large-scale areas, and adapt more
easily to single-point failures, thereby effectively encompassing a broader
range of applications. As the number of slave manipulators sharing a
communication network increases, the limitation of communication bandwidth
becomes critical. To alleviate bandwidth usage, the Try-Once-Discard (TOD)
scheduling protocol and event-triggered mechanisms are often employed
separately. In this paper, we combine both strategies to optimize network
bandwidth and energy consumption for SMMS teleoperation systems. Specifically,
we propose event-triggered control and communication schemes for a class of
SMMS teleoperation systems using the TOD scheduling protocol. Considering
dynamic uncertainties, the unavailability of relative velocities, and
time-varying delays, we develop adaptive controllers with virtual observers
based on event-triggered schemes to achieve master-slave synchronization.
Stability criteria for the SMMS teleoperation systems under these
event-triggered control and communication schemes are established,
demonstrating that Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, experiments are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出循环控制屏障函数(RCBF)，利用轨迹的循环特性进行安全验证，无需计算高维PDE或大规模SDP，通过数据驱动方法计算安全集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hamilton-Jacobi可达性分析和控制屏障函数方法计算负担重，需要求解高维偏微分方程或大规模半定规划，难以找到表征安全集的函数。

Method: 引入循环控制屏障函数概念，利用轨迹循环回到安全集的特性；提出数据驱动的非参数方法计算安全集，具有高度并行性。

Result: 在温和假设下，证明符号距离函数满足RCBF条件，将函数设计转化为集合识别问题，所得集合无需保持不变即可证明安全性。

Conclusion: RCBF提供了一种计算效率更高的安全验证方法，在保守性和计算成本之间实现权衡，适用于复杂动态系统的安全保证。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of complex dynamical systems often relies on
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis or Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
Both methods require computing a function that characterizes a safe set that
can be made (control) invariant. However, the computational burden of solving
high-dimensional partial differential equations (for HJ Reachability) or
large-scale semidefinite programs (for CBFs) makes finding such functions
challenging. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Recurrent Control
Barrier Functions (RCBFs), a novel class of CBFs that leverages a recurrent
property of the trajectories, i.e., coming back to a safe set, for safety
verification. Under mild assumptions, we show that the RCBF condition holds for
the signed-distance function, turning function design into set identification.
Notably, the resulting set need not be invariant to certify safety. We further
propose a data-driven nonparametric method to compute safe sets that is
massively parallelizable and trades off conservativeness against computational
cost.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate data-driven attack detection and identification
in a model-free setting. Unlike existing studies, we consider the case where
the available output data include malicious false-data injections. We aim to
detect and identify such attacks solely from the compromised data. We address
this problem in two scenarios: (1) when the system operator is aware of the
system's sparse observability condition, and (2) when the data are partially
clean (i.e., attack-free). In both scenarios, we derive conditions and
algorithms for detecting and identifying attacks using only the compromised
data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via
numerical simulations on a three-inertia system.

Motivation: 现有方法在同时证明系统稳定性和安全性时存在保守性，需要一种能够合成单一平滑Lyapunov函数的方法，既能保证渐近稳定性又能确保安全，同时最大化可证明的安全域。

Result: 在基准系统（包括功率转换器）上，该方法获得的认证安全稳定区域通常比最先进的SOS兼容CBF-CLF设计更少保守。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效合成同时证明稳定性和安全性的平滑Lyapunov函数，在保持可微性的同时最大化安全域，且比现有方法更少保守。

Abstract: We present a computational framework for synthesizing a single smooth
Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety. We show
that the existence of a strictly compatible pair of control barrier and control
Lyapunov functions (CBF-CLF) guarantees the existence of such a function on the
exact safe set certified by the barrier. To maximize the certifiable safe
domain while retaining differentiability, we employ a log-sum-exp (softmax)
relaxation of the nonsmooth maximum barrier, together with a
counterexample-guided refinement that inserts half-space cuts until a strict
barrier condition is verifiable. We then patch the softmax barrier with a CLF
via an explicit smooth bump construction, which is always feasible under the
strict compatibility condition. All conditions are formally verified using a
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver, enabled by a reformulation of
Farkas' lemma for encoding strict compatibility. On benchmark systems,
including a power converter, we show that the certified safe stabilization
regions obtained with the proposed approach are often less conservative than
those achieved by state-of-the-art sum-of-squares (SOS) compatible CBF-CLF
designs.

Abstract: Numerous elements drive the spread of infectious diseases in complex
real-world networks. Of particular interest is social behaviors that evolve in
tandem with the spread of disease. Moreover, recent studies highlight the
importance of understanding how multiple strains spread simultaneously through
a population (e.g. Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2). In this paper, we
propose a bi-virus SIS epidemic model coupled with a game-theoretic social
distancing behavior model. The behaviors are governed by replicator equations
from evolutionary game theory. The prevalence of each strain impacts the choice
of an individual to social distance, and, in turn, their behavior affects the
spread of each virus in the SIS model. Our analysis identifies equilibria of
the system and their local stability properties, which reveal several isolated
fixed points with varying levels of social distancing. We find that endemic
co-existence is possible only when the reproduction numbers of both strains are
equal. Assuming the reproduction number for each virus is the same, we identify
suitable parameter regimes that give rise to lines of coexistence equilibria.
Moreover, we also identify conditions for local exponential stability of said
lines of equilibria. We illustrate our findings with several numerical
simulations.

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信任感知深度Q网络的联邦学习防御方法，通过多信号证据集成和序列决策来抵御投毒和后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观测性下容易受到投毒和后门攻击，需要设计有效的防御机制。

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，使用信任感知深度Q网络集成多信号证据，优化长期鲁棒性-准确性目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上验证了方法的有效性：准确率稳步提升；客户端重叠增加能提高准确率并降低攻击成功率；信号预算减少时准确率保持稳定但攻击成功率上升。

Conclusion: 深度Q网络在鲁棒性-准确性权衡方面表现最佳，优于随机、线性Q和政策梯度控制器。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的多智能体LLM答案聚合算法OW和ISP，利用一阶和二阶信息改进多数投票，在理论和实证上都优于标准多数投票方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体LLM推理的快速发展，如何有效聚合多个LLM的答案成为基本挑战。标准多数投票平等对待所有答案，未能考虑模型间的潜在异质性和相关性。

Method: 设计了两种新聚合算法：最优权重(OW)和逆惊喜流行度(ISP)，利用一阶和二阶信息。理论分析表明这些方法在温和假设下能缓解多数投票的固有局限性。

Result: 在合成数据集、LLM微调基准(UltraFeedback、MMLU)和真实医疗场景(ARMMAN)上验证，新方法在所有情况下都一致优于多数投票。

Conclusion: OW和ISP方法不仅提供实际性能提升，还为设计鲁棒的多智能体LLM管道提供了概念性见解。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

### [182] [Budgeted Broadcast: An Activity-Dependent Pruning Rule for Neural Network Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01263)
*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过局部流量预算（活跃度×扇出）来平衡选择性和传播范围，提高编码熵和解相关性，在多种网络架构中实现更好的稀疏化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于损失影响（如幅度或梯度）来移除参数，但缺乏对网络表示多样性和效率的系统性考虑。

Method: 为每个单元分配局部流量预算（活跃度×扇出），通过约束熵分析推导出选择性-受众平衡方程，使用简单的局部执行器剪枝扇入（降低活跃度）或扇出（减少传播）。

Result: 在ASR Transformer、人脸识别ResNet和突触预测3D U-Net中，BB提高了编码熵和解相关性，在相同稀疏度下提升了准确率，有时甚至超过密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上获得了最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB方法易于集成，为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条路径。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive

scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios

TL;DR: RLP是一种信息驱动的强化预训练目标，将强化学习的探索精神引入预训练阶段，通过奖励思维链提供的信息增益来训练模型独立思考


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的大模型训练范式只在最后阶段使用强化学习，作者质疑这是否是最优方式，希望将强化学习的核心精神——探索——更早地引入训练过程

Method: 将思维链视为探索性动作，奖励基于思维链为预测未来token提供的信息增益。具体来说，奖励信号衡量在同时考虑上下文和采样推理链时，下一个token对数似然的增加程度

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上使用RLP预训练，在8个数学和科学基准上的总体平均提升了19%。在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上应用RLP，总体平均从42.81%提升到61.32%，科学推理任务提升23%

Conclusion: RLP成功地将强化学习重新定位为普通文本的预训练目标，弥合了下一个token预测与有用思维链推理出现之间的差距，在不同架构和模型规模上都表现出良好的可扩展性

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LQR和强化学习的混合控制框架，用于结构振动控制，在保持模型无关性的同时解决RL训练期间的安全风险问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的LQR控制需要繁琐的系统辨识，而纯RL方法在训练期间缺乏先验知识可能对结构造成损害。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也能比无控制情况表现更好。

Method: 使用基于随机选择模型和参数的LQR控制器来引导RL控制器，形成混合控制框架。LQR策略不依赖真实或近似结构模型，保持整体框架的模型无关性。

Result: 该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了朴素RL实现中固有的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决RL振动控制关键训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究，为模型无关的结构振动控制提供了安全有效的途径。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Motivation: 理解RNN的内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进设计至关重要，但目前缺乏有效的方法来分析信息在网络中的流动路径。

Method: 使用信息论方法量化输入和输出向量在节点间的互信息，识别信息中继节点，并在合成和真实时间序列分类任务中应用，包括LSTM和GRU等架构，还进行了节点敲除实验。

Result: 揭示了不同架构中信息中继的独特模式，提供了关于信息如何随时间处理和维持的见解，节点敲除实验证实了识别节点的功能重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅加深了对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

TL;DR: 提出NcPU框架解决PU学习中表示学习瓶颈，通过非对比学习损失和标签消歧方案，无需辅助信息即可提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PU学习方法在复杂数据集上性能远低于监督学习，主要瓶颈在于不可靠监督下难以学习判别性表示

Method: 结合噪声对鲁棒的非对比损失(NoiSNCL)和幻影标签消歧(PLD)方案，前者对齐类内表示，后者提供保守负监督

Result: 在多种数据集上显著超越现有PU方法，包括灾害后建筑损伤映射等实际应用场景

Conclusion: NcPU框架有效解决了PU学习中的表示学习瓶颈，为实际应用提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼动获得灵感，微眼动能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地希望找到一种方法能揭示LLM的潜在错误行为信号。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过扰动来引发指示模型错误行为的潜在信号。

Result: 在多个先进LLM上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测事实性、安全性、毒性和后门攻击等各类错误行为，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 预训练的LLM已经编码了标记自身错误所需的内部证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

TL;DR: ThinKV是一个思维自适应的KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合量化-淘汰策略显著减少大模型推理时的GPU内存占用，同时保持接近无损的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型的长输出上下文生成虽然支持扩展思维链，但也导致KV缓存快速增长，迅速耗尽GPU内存。

Method: 基于注意力稀疏性识别不同重要性的思维类型，采用混合量化-淘汰策略，根据思维重要性分配token精度，并随着推理轨迹演化逐步淘汰不重要思维的token。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，ThinKV仅使用不到5%的原始KV缓存就实现了接近无损的精度，推理吞吐量比最先进基线提高了5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV通过高效的KV缓存压缩有效解决了大模型推理中的内存瓶颈问题，实现了内存效率和推理性能的显著提升。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强模型可迁移性，支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于性能的规划，促进了机器学习技术在真实交通系统中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

*Aritra Das,Joseph T. Iosue,Victor V. Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，测试现有IDE方法在这些复杂流形上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内在维度估计方法在真实数据集上表现差异很大，需要更复杂的基准来评估这些方法，因为真实数据集通常位于具有小内在维度的潜在流形上。

Method: 基于量子光学方法构建QuIIEst基准，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，允许曲率修改和加性噪声，并在分形Hofstadter蝴蝶上进行IDE测试。

Result: 测试的IDE方法在QuIIEst流形上的准确性普遍低于现有基准，且性能随非均匀曲率增加而下降很小，表明基准具有内在难度。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准为IDE方法提供了更具挑战性的测试平台，揭示了现有方法在复杂流形上的局限性，并展示了在非流形空间上提取有效维度的能力。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video

statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action
representations satisfying our desiderata, under suitable conditions. Our
analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations
perform well in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理出发，通过变分互信息下界推导出两种自监督表示学习范式：自蒸馏互信息(SDMI)和联合互信息(JMI)，为现有方法的架构组件提供了理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然取得了显著经验成功，但其基本原理仍不够清晰。现有工作往往将预测器网络、停止梯度操作等架构元素视为经验性补充，缺乏理论支撑。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种训练范式：SDMI需要交替优化，理论上必须使用停止梯度操作；JMI允许通过对称架构进行联合优化。预测器网络和统计正则化器分别作为两种范式中互信息目标的可行替代。

Result: 证明许多现有自监督学习方法都是这两种范式的具体实例或近似，为不同架构组件的选择提供了超越启发式便利的理论解释。

Conclusion: 自监督表示学习算法的学习目标决定了其可能的优化策略和模型设计选择，预测器网络和停止梯度操作等组件在理论框架下具有明确的数学依据。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常被对抗性投毒、系统错误或低质量样本污染，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降，需要鲁棒的模仿学习方法。

Method: 使用小规模干净参考集训练二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，对密度比进行裁剪后作为权重用于行为克隆目标，优先学习干净专家行为。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染比例下仍能保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: Weighted BC方法能有效对抗数据集污染，具有理论保证和实际有效性，为安全关键应用中的离线强化学习提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估数据集对称性假设的方法，通过测量数据集的各向异性程度来检验对称性感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）的有效性假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性感知方法假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"，但这一假设缺乏有效的评估方法。作者旨在开发一种量化数据集各向异性程度的方法来检验该假设。

Method: 提出了一种通过双样本神经分类器测试来量化数据集各向异性的指标，该指标能够区分原始数据集与其随机增强的等效数据集。

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了该指标的有效性，并在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐。理论分析表明，分布对称性破缺可能阻止不变方法达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 等变方法的有效性取决于具体数据集：在某些各向异性数据集上仍能带来益处，但在其他数据集上则不能。理解等变性何时有效及其原因需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Motivation: 传统非牛顿流体动力学数值方法计算成本高、扩展性差，现有数据驱动方法仍需在不同物理条件下重新训练。需要开发能够高效学习复杂流体流动特征且具有强泛化能力的计算方法。

Method: 提出Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer)，利用自注意力机制高效学习复杂流体流动的不同空间相互作用和特征，是一种生成算子学习方法。

Result: RheOFormer在各种粘度和非粘度流动、不同类型粘弹性和弹粘塑性力学以及复杂域中都能准确预测，即使基于有限数据集训练也能准确学习非线性力学和流动演化。

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性欠拟合的概念，认为更好的扩散模型在输入空间的某些区域更准确地逼近分数函数，而在其他区域则欠拟合，这对于理解扩散模型的泛化能力至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在训练时学习分数函数用于生成样本，但一个基本未解决的问题是：它们实际学习了什么分数？如果完全匹配经验分数会简单地复制训练数据而无法生成新样本。

Method: 引入选择性欠拟合概念，通过表征这些区域并设计实证干预来验证这一观点。

Result: 研究结果表明选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要，为模型的泛化和生成性能提供了新的可测试见解。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型泛化能力的关键机制，更好的模型在特定区域更准确地学习分数函数，而在其他区域保持欠拟合状态。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

<details>

Motivation: 传统诊断模型孤立分析不同医疗数据源，限制了发现跨模态相关性进行早期疾病诊断的能力，需要整合多种数据流以提升诊断精度。

Method: 使用专用编码器将各模态数据映射到共享潜在空间，通过多头注意力和残差归一化进行融合，支持多任务预训练架构，便于快速适应新疾病和数据集。

Conclusion: 该模型朝着精准诊断的统一基础模型迈进，有望提高预测准确性并辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，可在推理时对掩码扩散模型进行自我校正，无需改变模型架构或训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要具备自我校正能力——在推理时检测和修正低质量标记。虽然掩码扩散模型在离散空间生成建模中表现出色，但其自我校正能力尚未被充分理解。现有方法要么需要重构MDM架构/训练，要么依赖不精确的标记质量代理，限制了应用范围。

Method: PRISM通过定义自我校正损失来学习每个标记的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。这些质量分数与MDM在同一前向传播中计算，用于检测低质量标记。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上提升了MDM推理性能：数独、无条件文本生成（170M参数）以及代码生成（LLaDA，8B参数）。

Conclusion: PRISM为掩码扩散模型提供了一种有效的推理时自我校正方法，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

Motivation: 平衡LLM生成质量与推理成本，特别是在需要多次生成时，传统方法如Best-of-N采样效率低下。

Method: 将每次生成视为打开一个代价随机的"盒子"，开发UCB风格的Pandora's Box算法，并通过Bradley-Terry变换解决跨提示的奖励缩放问题。

Result: 在多个LLM-奖励模型对上，自适应策略能达到与Best-of-N采样相同的性能，同时平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 建立了最优停止理论与推理时扩展之间的原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够使用复杂和机器学习的集体变量，拓宽了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Conclusion: 基于低秩表示的压缩-重建框架有效解决了神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip是一种差分隐私训练方法，用平滑的tanh变换替代硬裁剪，在保护敏感数据的同时显著减少子群体间的不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私（DP）虽然提供强隐私保护，但会降低模型性能并加剧不公平性，特别是对少数群体。DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号。

Method: 提出SoftAdaClip方法，用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，在限制敏感度的同时保留相对梯度幅度。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验显示，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD将子群体差异减少高达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少高达48%，且这些减少具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平且私有的模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCOPED是一种快速通用的扩散模型OOD检测方法，通过结合雅可比矩阵迹和得分函数平方范数，大幅减少前向传播次数，在视觉和机器人控制任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对于机器学习系统在视觉、机器人等领域的可靠部署至关重要，现有方法计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合雅可比矩阵迹和得分函数平方范数形成单一测试统计量，使用核密度估计估计分布内密度，仅需单次前向传播和一次雅可比向量积。

Result: 在四个视觉基准测试中达到竞争性或最先进的精度-召回分数，计算成本显著降低；在机器人控制任务中能有效识别跨奖励函数和训练机制的分布偏移。

Conclusion: SCOPED为现实世界领域提供了快速可靠的OOD检测实用基础，适用于视觉感知伪影、自回归模型异常检测、强化学习探索和无监督训练数据集筛选。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了MBPO在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳的原因，识别了动态模型与奖励模型尺度不匹配以及目标表示选择不当两个关键问题，通过解决这些问题使MBPO在大多数任务中超越了SAC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MBPO在OpenAI Gym中表现优异但在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳的原因，揭示环境特定假设如何影响算法设计，并识别导致性能下降的具体故障模式。

Method: 分析MBPO在DMC任务中的失败原因，识别尺度不匹配和模型方差问题，通过解决这些故障模式来改进算法性能。

Result: 解决了故障模式后，MBPO在7个DMC任务中的5个任务上超越了SAC，同时保持了在OpenAI Gym中的优异表现。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调需要开发将MDP任务和环境结构与算法故障模式联系起来的分类法，追求统一解决方案，并澄清基准选择如何影响算法泛化条件。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Conclusion: 研究为在噪声条件下开发符合人类偏好的AI系统提供了有价值的见解，强调了考虑现实噪声模型的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上的评估表明，LSPO能持续提升学习效果，并通过消融研究验证了长度信号整合方式的影响。

Conclusion: LSPO为RLVR训练提供了有效的动态采样策略，并为未来研究指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习的经验行为高度不一致：在一个设置中有效的在线微调设计选择在另一个设置中可能完全失败。

Method: 提出了稳定性-可塑性原则，识别了三种在线微调机制，每种需要不同的稳定性特性，并通过大规模实证研究验证该框架。

Result: 在63个案例中的45个，结果与该框架的预测高度一致。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的离线到在线强化学习设计选择提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型(LLM)的贝叶斯优化方法，使用LoRA微调和变分贝叶斯线性层(VBLL)来构建高效代理模型，解决高维黑盒优化问题。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的代理模型结合LoRA-VBLL框架，为高维黑盒优化问题提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

TL;DR: PEL-NAS是一种基于大语言模型的神经架构搜索方法，通过搜索空间分区、架构提示协同进化和零成本预测器，解决了传统方法搜索成本高和LLM方法探索偏差的问题，能在几分钟内找到高精度低延迟的神经网络架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超网方法需要多GPU天，而基于LLM的方法存在探索偏差，无法在整个搜索空间中发现不同延迟范围的架构。需要一种既能快速搜索又能避免探索偏差的方法。

Method: 1) 基于复杂度的搜索空间分区引擎；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子，通过知识库更新和引导进化算法；3) 零成本预测器避免大量候选架构的从头训练。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟比基线降低54%，搜索成本从数天降至数分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS通过搜索空间分区和协同进化策略有效解决了LLM驱动的NAS中的探索偏差问题，显著提高了搜索效率和结果质量。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了对抗性攻击可转移性的关键区别：数据空间攻击可以成功转移，而表示空间攻击通常无法转移，除非模型表示几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像对抗样本和文本越狱攻击能在不同模型间转移，但视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击却无法转移的差异现象。

Method: 通过理论证明和四个实验验证：1)数学证明相同输入输出映射但不同表示的网络；2)构造图像分类器的表示空间攻击；3)构造语言模型的表示空间攻击；4)构造视觉语言模型的数据空间攻击和几何对齐的表示空间攻击。

Result: 数据空间攻击成功转移，表示空间攻击通常失败，但当模型表示几何对齐时，表示空间攻击也能转移。

Conclusion: 对抗性转移不是所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

Conclusion: 概率节点关系等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的关键，Flock模型在零样本链接预测任务中表现出色

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

TL;DR: CarbonX是一个基于时间序列基础模型的开源工具，用于碳强度预测和插补等脱碳任务，仅需历史碳强度数据即可在全球214个电网中实现零样本预测，MAPE为15.82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碳强度预测工具存在三个主要限制：需要电网特定电力结构数据、依赖单独模型难以实现全球覆盖、缺乏不确定性估计。CarbonX旨在克服这些限制，提供更易用、覆盖更广的脱碳工具。

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型的通用性，仅使用历史碳强度数据和单一通用模型，支持零样本预测、插补等多种任务，并提供95%覆盖率的预测区间。

Result: 在214个全球电网中实现15.82%的零样本预测MAPE；在13个基准电网中平均MAPE为9.59%，尾部预测MAPE为16.54%；可提供长达21天的预测且精度下降最小；在插补任务中比统计基线提升1.2-3.9倍性能。

Conclusion: CarbonX能够在数据有限的情况下在任何电网中轻松使用并提供强大性能，是实用的全球规模脱碳工具。

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

Motivation: 二值神经网络验证问题通常被表述为整数规划问题，但由于大M约束导致的巨大整数间隙，自然IP公式往往难以求解，需要改进公式以提高验证效率。

Method: 1. 为多类别设置引入新的线性目标函数获取方法；2. 开发了利用BNN递归结构生成有效不等式的新技术，改进IP公式。

Result: 与现有IP方法相比，新技术能够在有限时间内验证BNN对抗更高范围的输入扰动，验证效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过改进IP公式的目标函数和约束条件，可以有效解决二值神经网络验证问题，提高验证效率和鲁棒性评估能力。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

### [221] [Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01545)
*Haoyuan Cai,Zhenghao Peng,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL)方法，通过人类干预的隐式偏好信号来预测未来状态，将单次干预扩展到未来L个时间步，从而提高学习效率和减少人类演示需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式模仿学习方法只修正当前状态的动作，不调整未来可能更危险状态的动作。需要一种方法将人类干预的影响传播到未来可能的安全关键区域。

Method: PPL将每次人类干预引导到未来L个时间步（偏好视界），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预。通过在这些未来状态上应用偏好优化，将专家修正传播到预期探索的安全关键区域。

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中验证了方法的效率和通用性。理论分析表明选择合适的偏好视界L可以平衡风险状态覆盖和标签正确性，从而限制算法最优性差距。

Conclusion: PPL通过引导人类干预到未来状态，显著提高了学习效率，减少了所需的人类演示数量，并在理论和实验上都证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo
and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL)框架，通过循环转换成功率作为奖励信号来训练模型提高一致性，显著提升了化学LLM的性能和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学大语言模型缺乏循环一致性，虽然能完成正向任务（如分子描述），但无法从自身生成的文本准确重建原始结构，表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握。

Method: 引入RTRL框架，使用循环转换成功率作为奖励信号训练模型；提出迭代变体，让正向和反向映射交替训练彼此，形成自改进循环，对化学中大量未标记数据特别有效。

Result: 实验表明RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下，相比强基线显著提升了性能和一致性。

Conclusion: 循环一致性不仅是理想属性，而且是可训练目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基座模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的攻击方法，能够绕过大型语言模型的提示保护机制，成功越狱多个生产级模型，揭示了轻量级提示保护的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，确保AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。轻量级提示保护机制虽然易于实现和更新，但其安全性存在隐患。

Method: 利用提示保护机制与主模型之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级保护无法解码但主模型能够理解的越狱提示。

Result: 该方法成功越狱了Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天接口，同时保持了响应质量。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示保护在现代LLM架构中存在固有的攻击面，需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Conclusion: 该框架是实现原生智能6G网络愿景的关键，为AI/ML模型在下一代蜂窝系统中的集成提供了基础支撑。

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSci是首个基于LLM的智能代理框架，用于通用时间序列预测，通过四个专门代理（Curator、Planner、Forecaster、Reporter）实现自动化预处理、模型选择和报告生成，显著降低预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法需要大量人工预处理、验证和集成，且现有模型针对特定数据集或领域，泛化能力差。需要一种通用的、领域无关的框架来最小化人工干预。

Method: TSci框架包含四个专门代理：Curator进行LLM引导的诊断和预处理；Planner通过多模态诊断和自我规划缩小模型选择空间；Forecaster执行模型拟合、验证并自适应选择最佳配置和集成策略；Reporter生成全面透明的报告。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，TSci持续优于统计和基于LLM的基线方法，分别平均减少预测误差10.4%和38.2%。

Conclusion: TSci将预测工作流程转变为可解释、可扩展的白盒系统，通过透明自然语言理由和全面报告提高了预测工作流程的透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

*Aniket Vashishtha,Qirun Dai,Hongyuan Mei,Amit Sharma,Chenhao Tan,Hao Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题评估LLM的反事实推理能力，发现从干预推理到反事实推理时SOTA模型准确率下降25-40%。强化学习相比监督微调能更好地提升模型在跨域任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM反事实推理能力的研究往往跳过溯因步骤，导致高估模型性能。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤（溯因、干预、预测）的框架，以提升LLM在科学等高风险领域的因果理解能力。

Method: 提出可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题操作化因果推理。该框架明确要求完整的三个推理步骤，并能创建不同难度的合成数据。比较了监督微调和强化学习两种训练方法的效果。

Result: 从干预推理到反事实推理时，o4-mini和Claude-4-Sonnet等SOTA模型准确率下降25-40%。监督微调虽提升域内性能但降低跨域任务准确率，而强化学习在代码任务上提升1.5-2倍，并能泛化到数学问题。

Conclusion: 强化学习能诱导核心认知行为并实现跨域泛化，相比监督微调更适合提升LLM的反事实推理能力。分析推理轨迹进一步证实了强化学习的潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练的推理时对齐方法，通过图像空间的KL代理正则化来防止奖励黑客问题，在保持提示一致性的同时提高奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像虽然符合文本提示，但往往无法满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学评分）。现有的推理时对齐方法存在奖励黑客问题，即模型生成高奖励但偏离原始提示的图像。

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入基于分数的图像空间KL代理，通过冻结主干网络来正则化采样轨迹，约束输出分布，使奖励增加而不发生分布偏移。还推导了使用扩散分数的KL可处理近似。

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL模型、多种奖励（美学、HPSv2、PickScore）和公共数据集上，MIRA相比强基线获得超过60%的胜率，同时保持提示一致性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移，而DNO随着计算增加而漂移。

Conclusion: MIRA有效解决了推理时对齐中的奖励黑客问题，通过图像空间约束实现了奖励提升而不损失提示一致性。还扩展了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时间，适用于不可微分奖励。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF中KL散度正则化的不同实现方式，建立了统一框架证明'k1 in reward'（如PPO）是Reverse KL正则化的原则性损失，并首次证明了在on-policy条件下'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'的梯度等价性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法中KL散度正则化的实现存在混淆，有些方法（如GRPO）将其作为数值估计系数而非优化损失，这忽略了其功能角色。需要建立统一框架来分析不同实现方式的理论基础。

Method: 建立统一框架连接两种实现风格：将数学项kn作为策略得分函数的分离系数（'kn in reward'）或作为直接传播梯度的损失函数（'kn as loss'）。通过梯度分析证明两者的等价关系。

Result: 证明'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的原则性损失；在on-policy条件下'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'梯度等价；揭示'k3 as loss'（如GRPO）仅是原则性损失的一阶有偏近似；指出off-policy实现因忽略重要性采样而产生偏差。

Conclusion: 提供了基于梯度的KL正则化选择和正确实现的全面理论依据，为构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

Conclusion: IBCD是一个有效的因果发现方法，能处理大规模干预数据并提供不确定性量化，在基因组扰动数据分析中具有实用价值

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

Motivation: 现有DiT模型服务系统使用固定并行度，无法有效处理异构工作负载（不同分辨率和截止时间），导致GPU利用率低和服务级别目标达成率差。

Method: 提出步级序列并行策略，根据请求截止时间动态调整并行度；设计轮次调度机制，将时间离散化，联合打包请求以最小化延迟完成。

Result: 在先进DiT模型上的评估显示，TetriServe相比现有解决方案可将服务级别目标达成率提升高达32%，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行度调整和智能调度，有效解决了DiT模型服务中的效率问题，显著提升了服务性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

TL;DR: SPAMP是一个统一的梯度整形框架，通过统计感知的逐层自适应调制和投影，将传统梯度裁剪推广为平滑的梯度整形方法。


<details>

Motivation: 传统梯度裁剪使用固定的硬阈值，缺乏灵活性且忽略了梯度分布的动态特性，限制了训练稳定性和性能。

Method: SPAMP跟踪局部梯度统计信息，动态估计阈值，并应用基于幂的变换以可微分方式调制更新幅度，将裁剪和预热重新表述为控制有效更新尺度的双重机制。

Conclusion: SPAMP为梯度整形提供了一个原则性的替代方案，超越了传统的启发式方法，能够更好地适应梯度分布的动态变化。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自适应压缩推理步骤来解决模型在复杂推理任务中的思考长度适应性问题，在提高准确率的同时显著减少推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前思考模型通过扩展测试时计算来解决复杂推理任务，但需要根据任务难度合理分配计算资源。过短推理会导致困难问题出错，过长推理则效率低下，这种思考长度不适应问题需要解决。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法，利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力机制识别重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤，同时估计任务难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习根据问题难度分配推理预算。

Result: 在多种任务上，TRAAC相比基础模型平均绝对准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。即使在非数学数据集上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRAAC通过任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩相结合，能够根据难度进行细粒度的思考预算调整，在多样化任务上实现准确率和效率的提升。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了NoRo框架来增强帕金森病远程监测中UPDRS评分的噪声鲁棒性预测，通过对比学习生成抗噪声特征，并在不同噪声环境下显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病远程监测中存在三种噪声：患者测量误差、环境噪声和数据包丢失，导致UPDRS评分预测误差增加，需要开发噪声鲁棒性解决方案。

Method: 1. 基于选定特征的连续值将语音特征分组为有序区间构建对比对；2. 使用对比对训练多层感知机编码器生成噪声鲁棒特征；3. 将鲁棒特征与原始特征拼接作为增强特征输入UPDRS预测模型。

Result: 通过可定制噪声注入模块的评估方法，实验表明NoRo在不同噪声环境和下游预测模型中都能成功增强UPDRS预测的噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoRo框架有效解决了帕金森病远程监测中的噪声问题，为UPDRS评分的准确预测提供了可靠的噪声鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型中使用的确定性伪随机数生成器会产生可预测模式，易受攻击者利用，而传统防御方法存在显著的能耗和延迟开销。

Method: 嵌入STT-MTJs硬件生成的真随机比特，构建高度并行的FPGA辅助计算系统，并将硬件随机数集成到生成对抗网络中。

Result: 系统以兆比特/秒速率提供真随机数，通过NIST随机性测试；在CIFAR-10训练的GAN中，与低质量随机数生成器相比，不安全输出减少高达18.6倍。

Conclusion: 基于STT-MTJ的系统具有纳秒级切换速度、高能效和良好可扩展性，有望扩展到10^6并行单元，实现千兆比特/秒吞吐量，适合大型语言模型采样。

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究变分自编码器中后验坍塌现象的本质，理解其是否仅仅是优化失败，还是由数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变现象。

Method: 通过分析后验坍塌相关平凡解的稳定性，识别临界超参数阈值，并在合成和真实数据集上验证临界行为。

Result: 发现了表征有意义的潜在推理与坍塌之间边界的临界边界，该边界由近似后验与先验分布之间KL散度的不连续性表征，证实了相变的存在。

Conclusion: 后验坍塌不是单纯的优化失败，而是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的新兴相变，为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT（监督微调）的高分并不总能转化为RL（强化学习）后的性能提升，甚至可能导致更差的结果。作者提出了泛化损失和大k值Pass率作为更好的RL结果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前LLM后训练中SFT和RL两阶段独立训练的实践，质疑高SFT分数是否能可靠预测RL后的性能提升。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和GRPO RLVR，在7个数学基准上进行了广泛评估，花费超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 发现基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用pre-RL性能预测精度更高，R²和Spearman相关系数提升高达0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT性能不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k提供了更好的预测能力，对实际应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 大规模实证研究发现：单独使用改写合成数据训练效果不如自然网络文本，但1/3改写合成数据与2/3自然数据混合可加速训练5-10倍；单独使用教科书式合成数据效果较差；最佳合成数据比例约30%；大模型生成的数据不一定更好；模型崩溃现象在不同合成数据类型中表现不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据供给有限，合成数据技术可能突破这一限制，但需要实证验证其在大规模预训练中的实际效果和最佳使用方法。

Method: 进行大规模实证研究（>1000个LLM，>10万GPU小时），使用统一协议和缩放定律，比较自然网络数据、多种合成数据类型（改写文本、生成教科书）及其混合数据。

Result: 改写合成数据单独使用效果不如自然数据，但与自然数据混合（1:2比例）可显著加速训练；教科书式合成数据单独使用效果较差；最佳合成数据比例约30%；大生成模型不一定产生更好的训练数据；模型崩溃现象在不同合成数据类型中表现不同。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性优势，需要谨慎选择类型和比例，为实际应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT)，通过可学习的几何路由机制，在三种几何空间中动态分配token，相比固定几何方法在知识图谱补全任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧数据上的表现。虽然双曲和球面几何扩展分别适用于层次和循环模式，但需要预先固定几何结构，无法适应混合几何特性的数据。

Method: CAT使用轻量级可微分门控机制，为每个token动态学习在三个几何注意力分支间的路由。每个分支采用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作，路由网络提供可解释的曲率偏好。

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR知识图谱补全基准上，CAT相比固定几何基线在MRR和Hits@10指标上提升约10%，仅增加5%参数且推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习几何自适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

Motivation: 在实际场景中，LLM生成的内容可能经过后生成编辑（如人工修订或欺骗攻击），因此需要检测和定位这些修改。

Method: 采用组合模式水印框架，将词汇表划分为不相交子集，在生成过程中通过在这些子集上强制执行确定性组合模式来嵌入水印，并设计轻量级局部统计量来标记和定位潜在编辑。

Result: 在开源LLM上对各种编辑场景进行评估，展示了在编辑定位方面的强大实证性能。

Conclusion: 提出的组合水印方法能够有效检测和定位对水印LLM输出进行的后生成编辑。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

Motivation: 解决softmax注意力二次复杂度瓶颈问题，现有子二次近似算法仅适用于有界输入假设，而实际LLMs中该假设很少成立，限制了应用范围。

Result: 建立了严格的理论保证，证明了子二次运行时间，并首次为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 支持基分解框架为现代LLMs提供了实用的高效注意力近似方法，突破了输入有界的限制，并深化了对多项式注意力机制的理解。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

Result: 在数值研究中显著优于现有方法，即使现有方法可以访问源域样本。

Conclusion: REFEREE方法成功解决了无源跨域持续学习问题，在禁止使用源域样本的情况下仍能取得优异性能。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

Motivation: 传统神经网络剪枝方法在达到中等稀疏度（50-60%）后难以进一步提升而不严重损害模型精度，需要突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 使用基于ADMM的标准约束优化技术，直接解决现有方法依赖代理目标函数的问题，并提出量化变体Elsa-L以适应超大规模模型。

Result: 在多种模型和规模上取得显著改进，在LLaMA-2-7B模型90%稀疏度下困惑度比最佳现有方法降低7.8倍，并扩展到27B模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在推进LLM稀疏化前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在目前探索有限的方向上仍存在显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

TL;DR: AsyPPO是一种为大型语言模型设计的强化学习框架，通过使用轻量级mini-critics集合来恢复批评者的作用，同时保持效率，解决了传统价值函数在大模型规模下的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL4LLM方法避免使用显式批评者，因为传统价值函数在大模型规模下计算成本高，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下容易失效。本文从架构角度重新审视这一瓶颈。

Method: 引入AsyPPO框架，使用一组轻量级mini-critics，每个在不相交的提示分片上训练，鼓励多样性同时保持校准。利用批评者间的不确定性来优化策略更新，包括在批评者一致时屏蔽优势，以及从熵正则化中过滤高分歧状态。

Result: 在仅有5000个样本的开源数据上训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提高学习稳定性和性能，相比GRPO等强基线，在Qwen3-4b-Base上性能提升超过6%，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上提升约3%。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO成功恢复了批评者的作用，同时在大模型设置中保持效率。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡有效提升了时间序列表示学习性能，特别是在分类任务上表现出色，并通过敏感性分析和消融研究验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

*Wangxuan Fan,Ching Wang,Siqi Li,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShapKAN是一个基于Shapley值的KAN网络剪枝框架，通过量化节点实际贡献来解决传统基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感的问题，实现网络压缩的同时保持节点重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络虽然预测性能好但缺乏可解释性，KAN网络通过可学习的样条激活函数能够恢复符号表示，但其独特架构给网络剪枝带来挑战，传统基于幅度的剪枝方法因对输入坐标偏移敏感而不可靠。

Method: 提出ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以平移不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不受输入参数化影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，ShapKAN能够保持真实节点重要性，同时实现有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: ShapKAN增强了KAN网络的可解释性优势，便于在资源受限环境中部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [247] [Beyond Simple Fusion: Adaptive Gated Fusion for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01677)
*Han Wu,Yanming Sun,Yunhe Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合网络(AGFN)，通过基于信息熵和模态重要性的双门融合机制自适应调整特征权重，以解决多模态情感分析中模态质量变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的简单融合技术无法处理模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致在识别细微情感时性能不佳。

Method: 使用双门融合机制，基于信息熵和模态重要性自适应调整特征权重，在单模态编码和跨模态交互后优先选择信息丰富的线索。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线，能有效识别细微情感且具有鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: AGFN通过减少特征位置与预测误差之间的相关性，从更广泛的特征分布中学习，增强了泛化能力，创建了更鲁棒的多模态特征表示。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于悲观原则的离线数据驱动分类优化框架PASTA，在数据覆盖不足的情况下仍能实现最优预期收益，并在多种选择模型下建立了首个有限样本遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类优化问题中由于数据覆盖不足导致的挑战，企业缺乏对底层选择模型的先验知识，只能基于历史客户选择数据确定最优分类。

Method: 引入悲观分类优化(PASTA)框架，利用悲观原则在一般选择模型下实现最优预期收益，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优分类而非覆盖所有可行分类。

Result: 为多项logit和嵌套logit等广泛使用的选择模型建立了首个有限样本遗憾界，证明了PASTA在样本和模型复杂度方面是最小最大最优的，数值实验显示优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PASTA框架有效解决了离线数据驱动分类优化中的数据覆盖不足问题，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

### [249] [Representational Alignment Across Model Layers and Brain Regions with Hierarchical Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01706)
*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了分层最优传输（HOT）框架，用于神经网络表示的全局对齐，解决了传统方法在深度不匹配网络中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示相似性方法存在不对称结果、缺乏全局对齐分数、难以处理不同深度网络的问题，因为它们忽略了全局激活结构并限制为一对一层对应。

Method: HOT框架联合推断软性、全局一致的层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元在多个目标层之间分布质量，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在比对质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配方法，并揭示了平滑、细粒度的分层对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别是在网络架构或深度不同的情况下，通过全局优化自然产生结构化模式。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

*Aidan Acquah,Shing Chan,Aiden Doherty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActiNet模型（自监督ResNet-V2+HMM）在手腕加速度计数据上比传统随机森林+HMM模型表现更好，能更准确地识别活动强度，适用于大规模流行病学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型流行病学研究中，需要可靠准确的人类活动识别模型来分析手腕加速度计数据，研究体力活动与健康结果的关系。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练ActiNet模型（18层自监督ResNet-V2），结合隐马尔可夫模型平滑，通过5折分层组交叉验证评估性能。

Result: ActiNet模型平均宏F1得分为0.82，Cohen's kappa为0.86，优于RF+HMM模型的0.77和0.81，在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: ActiNet模型适合从手腕加速度计数据中提取活动强度标签，可用于未来流行病学研究。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的联邦多模态学习框架能有效降低系统延迟并提升模型性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是首个无损的注意力算法重构，通过基础分解矩阵恒等式重新组织多头投影，在保持精确输出的同时实现数学保证的加速，无需重新训练即可减少计算量和模型大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制是大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化多集中于系统层面的I/O优化，缺乏数学上保证的无损算法级加速方法。

Method: 基于基础分解（BD）的矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重新组织为紧凑形式，保持精确输出不变，实现架构无关的数学加速。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite（16B，FP16）上，仅需4秒离线准备，无需重新训练，在现代GPU上实现32%更快的键/值投影和25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%（FP16）或0.0004%（FP32）。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论上精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为模型加速提供了新的算法级解决方案。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个具有线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，解决了分布鲁棒强化学习中函数逼近的收敛性问题，填补了鲁棒RL算法与理论保证之间的关键空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒TD学习的收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或依赖于限制性折扣因子假设，缺乏在函数逼近下的理论保证，而实际应用中函数逼近是必要的。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，使用总变差距离和Wasserstein-l距离不确定性集来衡量鲁棒性，模型无关且不需要MDP的生成访问。

Result: 建立了$\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$的样本复杂度以获得$\epsilon$-精确值估计，这是首个具有线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习收敛结果。

Conclusion: 该算法填补了鲁棒RL算法经验成功与理论保证之间的关键空白，且关键思想可相对直接地扩展到具有函数逼近的鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个体决策过程方面面临挑战，需要更有效的方法来建模工作地点选择。

Method: 采用深度神经网络方法对工作地点选择进行建模，并与传统离散选择模型进行比较分析。

Result: DNN在工作地点选择建模中显示出作为DCM强有力替代方案的潜力。DNN在某些方面优于DCM，但DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更吻合。DCM在短距离表现更佳，DNN在长距离与数据和DCM表现相当。

Conclusion: 选择工作地点选择分析模型时应根据具体应用需求，两种模型各有优势，需要基于特定场景进行选择。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私随机梯度下降（DPSGD）对模型公平性的影响，发现直接优化差分隐私模型的超参数虽然不能可靠地减轻DPSGD的差异性影响，但相比重用非私有模型的超参数，可以改善效用-公平性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DPSGD对神经网络公平性的影响，验证先前关于直接优化差分隐私模型超参数可以改善公平性的说法是否具有普遍性。

Method: 通过比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的差异性影响，并在广泛的超参数设置下进行分析，同时评估DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体的效果。

Result: DPSGD对某一指标的差异性影响不一定意味着对其他指标也有相同影响；直接优化差分隐私模型超参数不能可靠减轻DPSGD的差异性影响，但能改善效用-公平性权衡；超参数调优会带来额外的隐私泄露。

Conclusion: 需要仔细平衡隐私、效用和公平性之间的关系，DPSGD-Global-Adapt在超参数选择方面可能不是稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表示常受噪声或无关特征影响，这会降低模型性能和泛化能力。

Method: 使用无监督动态特征选择方法，为每个实例识别并移除图像中的误导性或冗余信息，确保只有最相关特征贡献于潜在空间。

Conclusion: 无监督动态特征选择方法能有效增强潜在表示，提高模型性能，且不依赖标注数据，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

Motivation: 现代视频游戏虽然动态丰富但计算成本高且不适合大规模实验，需要提供既具有挑战性又可扩展的GPU加速环境。

Method: 基于CHIP-8模拟器在JAX中实现经典街机游戏环境，提供图像化环境，涵盖解谜、动作和策略类型，完全在GPU上执行。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Motivation: 验证后处理隐私过滤技术在医学AI研究中生成隐私保护合成数据集的有效性，这些技术声称能移除包含个人身份信息的样本。

Method: 对胸部X光合成应用过滤管道进行严格评估，分析过滤器在检测真实图像和训练数据生成的近重复样本方面的表现。

Result: 当前过滤器特异性有限且不一致，仅对真实图像具有高敏感性，但无法可靠检测从训练数据生成的近重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤存在关键局限性，可能提供虚假安全感而无法有效保护患者隐私，需要过滤器设计的重大改进才能用于敏感应用。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出宽-窄-宽（沙漏）MLP块，将跳跃连接置于扩展维度，残差计算通过窄瓶颈进行，相比传统窄-宽-窄MLP设计在生成任务上获得更优的性能-参数帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统MLP的窄-宽-窄设计惯例，探索跳跃连接在扩展维度而非输入/输出维度操作的新架构，以实现增量精炼同时保持计算效率。

Method: 设计沙漏MLP块，使用初始投影将输入提升到扩展维度，跳跃连接在扩展维度操作，残差计算通过窄瓶颈进行。投影可保持随机初始化固定不变。在图像生成任务上通过系统架构搜索评估性能。

Result: 沙漏架构在生成任务上始终优于传统设计，随着参数预算增加，最优沙漏配置倾向于更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈，这与传统MLP的缩放模式不同。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的放置位置，这一发现可扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

TL;DR: 提出Sparse Query Attention (SQA)机制，通过减少查询头数量来降低注意力计算复杂度，在长序列处理中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力机制存在二次计算复杂度问题，现有解决方案如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力分数计算所需的FLOPs。

Method: 引入SQA架构，减少查询头数量而非键值头，直接降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，提出理论基础和数学公式化。

Result: 在32k-200k长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算受限场景下实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，对模型质量影响极小。

Conclusion: SQA是一种有效的注意力优化方法，为构建更高效和可扩展的模型提供了新工具。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

TL;DR: 提出了一种顺序不变的强化学习框架用于黑盒组合优化，通过随机生成顺序训练多元自回归生成模型，提高样本效率和搜索空间多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕捉复杂交互。需要一种更高效的方法来处理组合优化问题。

Method: 使用无固定变量顺序的多元自回归生成模型，在训练过程中采样随机生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用广义强化策略优化进行稳定策略梯度更新。

Result: 在广泛的基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常获得最佳性能，并始终避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 该方法通过顺序不变性提高了组合优化的样本效率和性能，在多种问题上表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Conclusion: G²RPO框架在流模型的强化学习中实现了更有效和鲁棒的偏好对齐。

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为AutoML工作流程提供了转变，在保持模型选择质量的同时大幅降低了计算需求。

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Result: 在行业启发的检索任务中，CNML在跨模态和模态内设置下显著优于算法和神经基线方法，学习到的表示能有效迁移到下游任务并泛化到更复杂的公式。

Conclusion: 模型检查可以作为学习形式语言表示的目标，为形式验证领域开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Motivation: 对称性在等变网络设计和控制方程发现中广泛应用，但在复杂场景中通常未知。现有方法大多局限于线性对称性，非线性对称性发现方法无法显式获得李代数子空间。

Conclusion: LieNLSD是第一个能够发现非线性对称性并显式表达其李代数子空间的方法，在复杂动态系统中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表达能力和概率推断的数据效率，实现了快速组合式元学习

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

Conclusion: APS方法成功克服了离散扩散后验采样的关键挑战，为预训练离散扩散基础模型在图像恢复任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

Motivation: 许多自然动态过程（如细胞分化、疾病进展）只能通过静态样本快照观察，重建其时间演化以揭示动态特性对科学研究至关重要。现有方法在高维情况下可扩展性差且需要严格假设。

Method: 扩展扩散Schrödinger桥匹配理论，提出多边际时间Schrödinger桥匹配(MMtSBM)，推导出迭代马尔可夫拟合算法，以因子化方式处理多边际问题。

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥为从静态数据恢复隐藏动态提供了一种实用且原则性的方法。

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the

preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and

Conclusion: EqM通过统一平衡景观替代时间条件速度，提供了流模型与能量基模型之间的紧密桥梁，以及优化驱动推理的简单途径。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

TL;DR: 本文探索了Tsetlin Machine在大型多通道图像分类中的应用，提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法，在保持可解释性的同时实现了与深度学习模型相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin Machine作为一种基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑的机器学习范式，相比神经网络具有更好的可解释性。本文旨在探索该架构在复杂大规模图像分类任务中的适用性。

Method: 提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: Tsetlin Machine在复杂大规模训练环境中仍能保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性优势。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将该模型应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RoGRAD框架，通过检索增强生成和迭代图对比学习来解决图神经网络在缺陷图数据上的性能问题，相比传统方法和LLM增强方法有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据存在多种缺陷，严重影响GNN性能。现有研究缺乏对传统图原生方法和LLM增强方法在复合缺陷下表现的全面比较，且LLM增强方法的优势假设尚未得到验证。

Method: 提出RoGRAD框架，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术注入类别一致且多样化的增强，通过迭代图对比学习强制区分性表示，将LLM增强从静态信号注入转变为动态精炼。

Result: 大量实验表明RoGRAD优于传统GNN和LLM增强基线方法，平均提升达到82.43%。

Conclusion: RoGRAD是首个迭代式LLM增强图学习范式，通过动态精炼机制有效提升了图神经网络在缺陷图数据上的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法在性能上仍落后于全参数微调，部分原因是未能充分利用低秩流形的几何结构。

Method: 使用三因子分解U-S-V⊤，将适配器的输入输出子空间V和U与缩放因子S分离，约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，采用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法通过充分利用低秩流形的几何结构，显著提升了性能，同时保持与现有微调流程的兼容性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

Conclusion: 成功将后处理模型校准技术集成到联邦学习中，为联邦私有校准提供了有效解决方案，在不同隐私要求下推荐使用不同的校准方法。

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

TL;DR: PepCompass是一个几何感知的肽探索和优化框架，通过定义解码器诱导的黎曼流形家族来捕捉局部几何结构，提出局部探索方法和优化算法，在体外验证中成功发现了25种高活性抗菌肽。

Conclusion: 几何信息探索为抗菌肽设计提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

TL;DR: 提出GraphNC框架，通过异常分数分布对齐和基于扰动的正态性正则化来校准图异常检测中的正态性，解决现有半监督方法容易过拟合标注节点的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合给定模式，导致高误报率。需要利用标注和未标注数据共同校准正态性。

Method: GraphNC包含两个组件：1) 异常分数分布对齐(ScoreDA) - 将模型异常分数与教师模型分数分布对齐；2) 基于扰动的正态性正则化(NormReg) - 通过在表示空间中最小化扰动引导的一致性损失，使正常节点表示更紧凑。

Result: 该方法能有效将正常和异常类别的异常分数推向两端，产生更可分离的异常分数，同时通过表示空间正则化缓解教师模型不准确分数的影响。

Conclusion: GraphNC通过联合利用标注和未标注数据，在异常分数和节点表示空间中校准正态性，提高了半监督图异常检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

Motivation: 单一流模型在不同类型的分布上表现不一致，需要一种能够适应多种后验分布的鲁棒变分推断方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）顺序训练各个流专家；2）通过似然驱动的更新进行自适应全局权重估计，无需逐样本门控或架构更改。

Result: 在六种典型后验分布上，AMF-VI实现了比单一流基线更低的负对数似然，并在Wasserstein-2距离和最大均值差异指标上获得稳定增益。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流提供了一条可靠路径，可在保持各专家归纳偏好的同时，实现跨不同后验分布的鲁棒变分推断。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

TL;DR: KAIROS是一个非自回归时间序列预测框架，直接建模段级多峰分布，避免误差累积，实现实时推理，在六个基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Motivation: Web应用需要快速响应的时间序列预测来支持实时决策，如资源规划、缓存放置和异常响应，而现有方法在响应速度和预测精度方面存在不足。

Method: 采用非自回归设计，直接建模段级多峰分布，避免自回归方法的误差累积问题，同时克服现有非自回归模型预测过度平滑的缺陷。

Result: 在大规模语料库上训练后，KAIROS在六个广泛使用的基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，预测性能与类似规模的先进基础模型相当，但推理成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: KAIROS展示了非自回归设计作为时间序列基础模型可扩展范式的重要性，为Web应用提供了高效的时间序列预测解决方案。

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种直接从Hugging Face等非结构化模型仓库学习权重空间表示的方法，无需依赖精心策划的模型动物园，解决了权重空间学习领域对大规模计算资源的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重空间学习通常需要大量精心构建的已训练模型集合（模型动物园），这需要大量计算资源，限制了权重空间表示的规模和灵活性。本研究旨在摆脱这一限制。

Method: 提出新的权重空间骨干网络，专门处理来自Hugging Face等非结构化模型仓库的高度异构模型，这些模型在架构、数据集和文档方面都存在很大差异。

Result: 在Hugging Face模型上训练的权重空间表示实现了强大性能，通常优于在实验室生成的模型动物园上训练的骨干网络，并且能够泛化到未见过的数据模态。

Conclusion: 研究表明高质量权重空间表示可以从非结构化模型仓库中学习，证明精心策划的模型动物园并非不可或缺，从而克服了权重空间学习社区当前面临的重大限制。

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

TL;DR: 提出PENEX（惩罚指数损失），一种新的多类指数损失公式，可作为AdaBoost的深度学习替代方案，通过一阶方法优化并隐式最大化数据点边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaBoost在实践中随着弱学习器数量增加而泛化良好，但其指数损失难以通过一阶方法优化。现有多类指数损失公式不适合深度学习优化。

Method: 提出PENEX损失函数，理论推导证明其隐式最大化边界，梯度增量隐式参数化boosting框架中的弱学习器。

Result: 在计算机视觉和语言任务中，PENEX表现出比类似计算成本方法更好的正则化效果。

Conclusion: PENEX作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，在深度神经网络训练和微调中具有潜力。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Method: 使用机器学习模型（LSTM、GRU和混合BiLSTM-XGBoost模型），基于2017-2022年的天然气消费和气象数据进行分析和预测。

Result: 混合BiLSTM-XGBoost模型在准确性方面优于其他模型，具有更低的RMSE、MAPE和MPE值，在数据有限的情况下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法特别是混合模型可有效预测天然气消费，有助于资源管理和减少季节性短缺，地理和气候因素在预测模型中至关重要。

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

TL;DR: 提出一个端到端框架，在数千万几何对中实现精确召回控制，误差小于1%，同时保持TPU友好性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模空间融合和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回控制至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度人工审查会增加成本。

Method: 使用等网格边界框过滤器和CSR候选表示减少对枚举，通过确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经排序器，使用四种互补阈值估计器并通过逆方差加权聚合，融合九个独立子样本。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万对）上评估，该方法始终在较小误差内达到召回目标，相比其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，并在单个TPU v3核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了精确的召回控制，显著降低了阈值方差，提高了大规模空间融合任务的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在误差独立时表现良好，而先解混淆的方法依赖于普遍因子结构或非线性。需要一种能够处理潜在混淆的统一方法。

Method: 提出DECOR方法，使用基于似然的完全可微分估计器，交替执行平滑无环图更新和凸噪声更新，可包含轻量弓形互补惩罚或后处理协调步骤。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，DECOR匹配或优于强基线方法，在非普遍混淆情况下尤其稳健，在普遍混淆情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DECOR为存在潜在混淆的线性高斯SEM提供了一种有效的联合学习方法，理论保证了参数可识别性条件。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

Motivation: 将扩散模型中成功的引导机制扩展到标准在线强化学习方法，实现更可控的行为调控。

Method: 在策略梯度中添加无条件分支，通过插值条件和无条件分支来引导策略，在优势估计下归一化项消失，得到简洁的引导策略梯度更新公式。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件dropout在简单离散任务和低样本情况下有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大引导系数能持续改善稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: 引导机制可以成功扩展到标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中状态观测往往由动作随机触发，而非每个时间步都能获得观测，需要专门的理论和算法来处理这种稀疏观测约束。

Method: 提出了动作序列学习范式，在动作触发观测的框架下推导贝尔曼最优方程，在线性MDP假设下构建动作序列特征映射，并开发了具有统计误差保证的离策略估计器和ST-LSVI-UCB算法。

Result: ST-LSVI-UCB算法实现了$\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$的遗憾界，其中K是回合数，d是特征维度，γ是折扣因子。

Conclusion: 该工作为动作触发稀疏观测下的学习建立了理论基础，证明了在这种观测约束下高效学习仍然是可行的。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

Motivation: 传统SGLD无法偏向平坦最小值，而深度学习泛化与平坦最小值密切相关，需要开发能有效寻找低曲率解的优化方法。

Method: fSGLD在每次迭代中使用随机权重扰动(RWP)评估随机梯度，优化隐含曲率信息的随机平滑目标，通过适当耦合逆温度和扰动尺度实现理论保证。

Result: 理论证明fSGLD的平稳测度集中在Hessian迹正则化损失函数的全局最小化器附近，实验显示在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中达到优越或相当的泛化性和鲁棒性，计算成本仅为SGD水平。

Conclusion: fSGLD能有效寻找平坦最小值，提供随机权重扰动益处的严格理论解释，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert

difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

*Daniel Gallo Fernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poolformer是一种序列到序列模型，用循环层和池化操作替代自注意力机制，解决了长序列处理中自注意力的二次复杂度问题，在音频处理任务上超越了现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在长序列处理中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在长序列任务中的实用性。需要开发更高效的序列建模方法来处理长序列数据。

Method: 使用循环层替代自注意力机制，并引入池化操作来减少序列长度。模型采用SkipBlocks递归定义，包含残差块、下池化层、嵌套SkipBlock、上池化层和额外残差块。

Result: 池化操作显著加速训练过程，改善感知指标（FID和IS），并防止过拟合。在原始音频处理任务上，Poolformer超越了SaShiMi和Mamba等最先进模型。

Conclusion: Poolformer通过池化和循环层的结合，有效解决了长序列建模问题，未来可扩展到文本、视觉和多模态场景中应用。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process

### [301] [StockBench: Can LLM Agents Trade Stocks Profitably In Real-world Markets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02209)
*Yanxu Chen,Zijun Yao,Yantao Liu,Jin Ye,Jianing Yu,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StockBench是一个无污染的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在真实多个月股票交易环境中的表现，填补了金融领域动态交易评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态迭代特性，而金融领域对经济价值和高风险决策具有直接相关性但尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建StockBench基准，让代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），做出连续的买入、卖出或持有决策，并使用累计回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估显示大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入持有基准，但部分模型展现出获得更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 在静态金融知识任务表现出色不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，这凸显了开发LLM驱动的金融代理的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

*Hanyang Zhao,Dawen Liang,Wenpin Tang,David Yao,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiFFPO是一个统一的强化学习框架，用于训练掩码扩散大语言模型，使其推理能力更强且速度更快。通过离策略RL训练代理策略，结合两阶段似然近似和重要性采样校正，提高样本效率和任务性能。同时联合训练高效采样器，让模型自适应分配推理阈值，在减少函数评估次数的同时获得更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如d1在训练扩散大语言模型时存在似然计算困难的问题，且缺乏对推理效率的优化。需要开发既能提升推理质量又能加速推理速度的统一框架。

Method: 1. 使用离策略RL训练代理策略作为真实扩散LLM策略的近似；2. 提出更准确的两阶段似然近似结合重要性采样校正；3. 联合训练高效采样器，让模型自适应分配每个提示的推理阈值。

Result: 在数学和规划基准任务上训练开源大扩散语言模型，相比仅训练模型，联合训练采样器能以更少的函数评估次数获得更好的准确率，在推理计算帕累托前沿上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架通过强化学习有效提升了扩散大语言模型的推理质量和效率，实现了推理能力与速度的双重优化，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出C2AL方法，通过分析数据子结构和利用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，解决推荐系统中数据异构性导致的模型偏向问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模推荐模型假设用户群体同质化，但真实数据由异质群体组成。随着模型规模和复杂度增加，模型会偏向中心分布模式，忽视头部和尾部区域，导致注意力权重不活跃或神经元死亡。

Method: 利用注意力机制在因子分解机中进行共享嵌入选择，通过分析数据子结构并暴露具有强分布对比的子结构进行辅助学习。使用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，定制注意力层学习过程。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上评估了6个SOTA模型。因子分解机能够使用该方法捕获细粒度用户-广告交互，整体归一化熵降低达0.16%，在目标少数群体上增益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: C2AL方法通过辅助学习有效解决了推荐系统中的数据异构性问题，既保持了与少数群体的互信息，又提升了全局性能。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

Motivation: 扩散生成式插补方法在实践中表现出色，但缺乏理论理解，特别是对复杂时空依赖关系的捕捉能力以及缺失值不确定性的量化。

Method: 基于条件扩散变换器，推导条件评分函数的近似理论，建立统计样本复杂度界限，并通过混合掩码训练策略验证理论。

Result: 建立了紧密的缺失值置信区域，发现缺失模式对插补效率和准确性有显著影响，混合掩码训练能提升性能。

Conclusion: 扩散变换器在时序数据插补中具有统计效率，能有效量化不确定性，且通过优化训练策略可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于copula的方法，能够从现有的多步时间序列基础模型中高效生成具有相关性的预测样本路径，避免了自回归采样的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型只能预测各时间步的独立边际分布，无法生成具有现实相关结构的完整联合预测分布。自回归采样虽然能生成相关样本路径，但计算成本极高。

Method: 使用copula方法，在单次前向传播中从多步时间序列基础模型生成具有相关性的样本路径。

Result: 该方法比自回归采样快数个数量级，并通过减轻误差累积现象提高了样本路径质量。

Conclusion: 基于copula的方法能够高效生成准确且具有相关性的预测样本路径，解决了现有方法在计算效率和相关性建模方面的局限性。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了Transformer和xLSTM的扩展规律，发现在典型的大语言模型训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer具有更有利的扩展特性，且随着训练和推理上下文长度的增加，xLSTM的优势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer一直是主导架构，但xLSTM等替代方案在保持竞争力的同时具有线性复杂度。本研究旨在比较这两种架构的扩展行为，为未来模型设计和部署提供指导。

Method: 1) 在80M-7B模型规模和2B-2T训练token范围内，使用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法研究xLSTM在计算最优和过度训练机制下的扩展行为；2) 研究最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；3) 分析推理时的扩展特性。

Result: 研究发现在典型的大语言模型训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer具有更有利的扩展特性。重要的是，随着训练和推理上下文长度的增加，xLSTM的优势更加明显。

Conclusion: xLSTM在扩展规律方面优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景下表现更佳，这为未来大语言模型的架构选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中用户设备可以在多个网络切片间无缝切换，这种灵活性可能被利用来发起分布式切片移动性攻击，需要有效的安全防护方案。

Method: 结合长短期记忆自编码器和K-Means聚类的正未标记学习方法，使用3GPP关键性能指标和性能测量计数器作为特征。

Result: 在基于free5GC和UERANSIM的5G测试床上评估，在训练数据集有10%-40%攻击污染的情况下，F1分数超过98.50%，优于同类解决方案。

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender能够有效检测分布式切片移动性攻击变种，在训练数据被污染时仍保持鲁棒性，为5G网络切片安全提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统深度学习优化中必须每步更新所有层的假设，认为全网络更新在理论和实践中都存在根本性次优问题。

Method: 提出非欧几里得随机渐进训练方法Drop-Muon，每步仅按随机调度更新部分层，结合渐进式训练效率和层特异性非欧几里得更新。

Result: 在CNN实验中，Drop-Muon始终优于全网络Muon，达到相同精度时wall-clock时间快达1.4倍。理论分析表明全网络更新仅在特定层平滑度关系下才是最优的。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明大规模模型训练方式需要转变，Drop-Muon为全网络更新提供了高效且理论基础的替代方案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线策略训练丢弃经验导致计算效率低下和不稳定，需要探索经验特征对大型推理模型学习动态的影响

Method: 识别经验价值指标（正确性和熵），提出ExGRPO框架组织优先经验，使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用

Result: 在1.5B-8B参数模型上，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均提升3.5/7.6分，并在强弱模型上稳定训练

Conclusion: 原则性经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Motivation: 传统GNN在分子机器学习中依赖预定义的图结构，这限制了模型的表达能力并降低了推理速度。本文旨在探索纯Transformer是否能在没有图结构先验的情况下有效建模分子能量和力。

Method: 使用未经修改的标准Transformer架构，直接在笛卡尔坐标上训练，不引入预定义的图结构或物理先验，与最先进的等变GNN在相同训练计算预算下进行比较。

Result: Transformer在OMol25数据集上达到了与最先进GNN相竞争的能量和力平均绝对误差，并自适应学习了物理一致的注意力模式（如注意力权重与原子间距离成反比衰减）。

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

Motivation: 解决反应式干扰问题，干扰者采用动态策略选择信道和感知阈值来检测和干扰正在进行的传输，需要一种无需先验知识的自适应方法。

Method: 采用Q-learning处理离散干扰事件状态，使用深度Q网络(DQN)处理基于接收功率的连续状态，通过不同的奖励函数和动作集进行学习。

Result: 强化学习能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化时维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对动态干扰策略的有效方法，能够在未知信道条件和干扰策略的情况下实现性能优化。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

Motivation: 射频信号传播建模对于环境理解和无线网络优化至关重要，但复杂环境中的准确预测仍具挑战性，因为信号会受到吸收、反射等障碍物影响。

Method: 基于扩散模型的方法，使用3D点云数据，开发RF-3D编码器来捕捉3D几何和信号特征，通过多尺度嵌入模拟实际射频信号传播过程。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在射频信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为无线诊断、部署和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

TL;DR: DialTree-RPO是一个基于树搜索的强化学习框架，用于自主发现多样化的多轮对话攻击策略，在10个目标模型上比现有方法攻击成功率提高25.9%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互场景下仍然容易受到对抗攻击，现有方法要么依赖人工红队测试，要么使用预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的广阔空间，特别是考虑到LLMs对多轮攻击的脆弱性显著高于单轮攻击。

Method: 提出DialTree-RPO框架，将对话视为顺序决策问题，结合树搜索的在线策略强化学习，无需人工标注数据就能系统性地探索多轮攻击策略。

Result: 在10个目标模型上，该方法比现有最优方法攻击成功率提高25.9%以上，并能有效发现新的攻击策略，通过学习最大化多轮攻击成功率的对话策略。

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO框架能够自主发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，显著提高了对LLMs安全漏洞的发现能力，为AI安全研究提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

Motivation: 传统神经网络训练遵循固定的优化方案，缺乏动态响应训练不稳定或问题的灵活性。

Method: 使用控制服务器作为用户/代理与训练过程之间的中介，支持实时调整优化器超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。

Result: 通过三个案例研究证明，该框架实现了更好的训练稳定性、降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并提高了对用户需求变化的适应性。

Conclusion: 为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest
baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image
generation. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在各种领域表现出卓越的泛化能力，但其机制尚未完全理解。基于流形假设，作者想验证这些能力是否源于模型对数据低维几何结构的适应。

Method: 通过研究经验分数匹配目标最小化器的平滑效应来检查隐式正则化的作用，分析平滑分数函数（或等效地在对数密度域中平滑）如何产生沿数据流形的切向平滑。

Result: 理论和实证结果证实，平滑分数函数会产生沿数据流形的切向平滑，并且通过选择适当的平滑可以控制扩散模型泛化的流形。

Conclusion: 研究支持了扩散模型成功源于其适应数据低维几何结构的猜想，揭示了分数匹配中隐式正则化在促进沿数据流形泛化方面的作用。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LPCA方法在高噪声环境下存在邻域大小选择的权衡问题，需要先验的几何和噪声特征知识，而这些信息通常不可得。

Method: LEGO方法通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计每个数据点的切空间，利用数据的全局结构指导局部切空间估计。

Result: 实验表明LEGO方法在噪声环境下比LPCA显著更鲁棒，在流形学习、边界检测和局部本征维度估计等下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LEGO方法通过利用全局结构信息，有效解决了高噪声环境下切空间估计的挑战，为数据流形分析提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

TL;DR: KaVa框架通过从教师模型的压缩KV缓存中蒸馏知识到潜在推理学生模型，解决了潜在推理缺乏监督的问题，结合了CoT的准确性和潜在推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式思维链推理计算成本高且包含冗余信息，而潜在推理缺乏有效监督，限制了其在复杂自然语言推理中的效果。

Method: 提出KaVa框架，通过自蒸馏将教师模型压缩KV缓存中的知识转移到潜在推理学生模型，利用连续潜在token的表示灵活性对齐步骤级KV轨迹。

Result: 该方法持续优于强潜在基线，从仅方程到自然语言轨迹的退化显著减小，可扩展到更大骨干网络同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜在推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了CoT训练教师的准确性和潜在推理的效率与可部署性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多跟随者贝叶斯Stackelberg博弈的在线学习问题，提出了在不同反馈设置下的学习算法和遗憾界分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多跟随者贝叶斯Stackelberg博弈中，领导者的最优策略依赖于跟随者私有类型的分布。当类型分布未知时，需要设计在线学习算法来最小化遗憾。

Method: 设计了两种反馈设置下的学习算法：类型反馈（观察跟随者类型）和动作反馈（仅观察跟随者动作）。对于类型反馈，设计了针对独立类型分布和一般类型分布的算法；对于动作反馈，设计了基于动作观察的算法。

Result: 在类型反馈下，获得了O(√(min{Llog(nKAT), nK}·T))（独立分布）和O(√(min{Llog(nKAT), Kⁿ}·T))（一般分布）的遗憾界；在动作反馈下，获得了O(min{√(nᴸKᴸA²ᴸLTlogT), Kⁿ√TlogT})的遗憾界。还提供了Ω(√(min{L, nK}T))的下界。

Conclusion: 提出的学习算法在不同反馈设置下都能有效降低遗憾，且遗憾界不会随跟随者数量n呈多项式增长。下界与类型反馈上界几乎匹配，表明算法性能接近最优。

Abstract: In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed
strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$
possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on
the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning
version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers
with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal
is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility
of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design
learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under
type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round,
we design algorithms that achieve $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK
\} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\mathcal
O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for general type
distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial
rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers'
actions, we design algorithms with $\mathcal O( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T
\log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )$ regret. We also provide a lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})$, almost matching the type-feedback upper
bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典贝叶斯劝说模型假设接收者知道发送者的承诺，但现实中接收者往往需要从重复互动中推断信号方案。本文研究这种推断设置下的性能界限和方案设计方法。

Method: 1. 分析发送者在推断设置下的性能损失界限；2. 推导发送者达到已知承诺性能所需的样本量下界；3. 提出两种设计可推断信号方案的方法：SGD和有限理性接收者模型优化。

Result: 1. 性能损失界限随信号空间大小增长，随接收者最优行动区分度增加而减小；2. 劝说场景比Stackelberg博弈需要更多样本；3. SGD在低互动机制中表现最佳，有限理性模型提供灵活的设计方法；4. 在安全警报示例中，SGD找到的信号方案信号更少且使公民最优行动更易区分。

Conclusion: 在接收者推断信号方案的环境中，发送者面临性能损失，但通过适当的方案设计方法（特别是SGD和有限理性模型）可以有效缓解这一问题，并在实际应用中取得良好效果。

Abstract: In Bayesian persuasion, an informed sender, who observes a state, commits to
a randomized signaling scheme that guides a self-interested receiver's actions.
Classical models assume the receiver knows the commitment. We, instead, study
the setting where the receiver infers the scheme from repeated interactions. We
bound the sender's performance loss relative to the known-commitment case by a
term that grows with the signal space size and shrinks as the receiver's
optimal actions become more distinct. We then lower bound the samples required
for the sender to approximately achieve their known-commitment performance in
the inference setting. We show that the sender requires more samples in
persuasion compared to the leader in a Stackelberg game, which includes
commitment but lacks signaling. Motivated by these bounds, we propose two
methods for designing inferable signaling schemes, one being stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) on the sender's inference-setting utility, and the other
being optimization with a boundedly-rational receiver model. SGD performs best
in low-interaction regimes, but modeling the receiver as boundedly-rational and
tuning the rationality constant still provides a flexible method for designing
inferable schemes. Finally, we apply SGD to a safety alert example and show it
to find schemes that have fewer signals and make citizens' optimal actions more
distinct compared to the known-commitment case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究表明单个代理人的操纵收益有限，但代理人群体合谋操纵的情况尚未被探索，需要研究公平分配机制对合谋操纵的脆弱性。

Method: 定义了SGIR和GIR来衡量合谋操纵的收益，其中SGIR是腐败代理人激励比率的最大值，GIR是最小值。然后严格分析了MNW、PS和RR三种机制的SGIR和GIR。

Result: MNW的GIR为2，与联盟规模无关；对于联盟规模c≥1，MNW和PS的SGIR以及PS和RR的GIR都是c+1；RR的SGIR在c≥2时无界。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了这三种机制在应对合谋操纵脆弱性方面的根本差异，为理解公平分配机制的抗合谋能力提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study fair division problems with strategic agents capable of gaining
advantages by manipulating their reported preferences. Although several
impossibility results have revealed the incompatibility of truthfulness with
standard fairness criteria, subsequent works have circumvented this limitation
through the incentive ratio framework. Previous studies demonstrate that
fundamental mechanisms like Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) and Probabilistic Serial
(PS) for divisible goods, and Round-Robin (RR) for indivisible goods achieve an
incentive ratio of $2$, implying that no individual agent can gain more than
double his truthful utility through manipulation. However, collusive
manipulation by agent groups remains unexplored.
  In this work, we define strong group incentive ratio (SGIR) and group
incentive ratio (GIR) to measure the gain of collusive manipulation, where SGIR
and GIR are respectively the maximum and minimum of the incentive ratios of
corrupted agents. Then, we tightly characterize the SGIRs and GIRs of MNW, PS,
and RR. In particular, the GIR of MNW is $2$ regardless of the coalition size.
Moreover, for coalition size $c \geq 1$, the SGIRs of MNW and PS, and the GIRs
of PS and RR are $c + 1$. Finally, the SGIR of RR is unbounded for coalition
size $c \geq 2$. Our results reveal fundamental differences of these three
mechanisms in their vulnerability to collusion.

Abstract: This paper presents a model of multi-group Bayesian games (MBGs) to describe
the group behavior in Bayesian games, and gives methods to find (strongly)
multi-group Bayesian Nash equilibria (MBNE) of this model with a proposed
transformation. MBNE represent the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the
situation where players within a group play a cooperative game, while strongly
MBNE characterize the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the situation
where players within a group play a noncooperative game. Firstly, we propose a
model of MBGs and give a transformation to convert any MBG into a multi-group
ex-ante agent game (MEAG) which is a normal-form game. Secondly, we give a
sufficient and necessary condition for a MBG's MEAG to be (strongly) potential.
If it is (strongly) potential, all its (strongly) Nash equilibria can be found,
and then all (strongly) MBNE of the MBG can be obtained by leveraging the
transformation's good properties. Finally, we provide algorithms for finding
(strongly) MBNE of a MBG whose MEAG is (strongly) potential and use an
illustrative example to verify the correctness of our results.

Motivation: 传统评估基准无法捕捉LLM智能体在交互环境中涌现的社会和认知动态，需要新的评估方法来理解智能体在沟通、说服和协作中的行为。

Method: 使用多智能体辩论作为"社会实验室"，让具有不同角色和激励的LLM智能体在LLM主持人的监督下就各种话题进行辩论，并采用心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 发现智能体具有强烈的共识寻求倾向，语义一致性高达0.88以上；角色分配能形成稳定的心理测量特征；主持人的角色能显著改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为面向智能体环境的新一代动态、基于心理测量的评估协议提供了蓝图，为理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为提供了关键方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have

TL;DR: 本文通过"海上求生"社会心理学任务评估大语言模型与人类集体决策的对齐程度，发现不同模型在反映或补偿人类偏见方面存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，需要检验它们与人类社会推理的对齐程度，特别是在集体层面而非个体层面。

Method: 使用"海上求生"任务进行大规模在线实验，随机分配群体进行带有人口属性或匿名别名的领导者选举，然后基于人类数据模拟匹配的LLM群体，测试多个主流模型。

Result: LLM行为出现分化：有些模型反映人类偏见，有些则掩盖这些偏见并试图补偿。人类-AI在集体推理中的对齐取决于情境、线索和模型特定的归纳偏见。

Conclusion: 理解LLM如何与集体人类行为对齐对于推进社会对齐AI至关重要，需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了ROTE算法，将人类行为建模为行为程序而非信念驱动的策略，结合LLM生成假设空间和概率推理处理不确定性，在预测人类行为方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类行为建模方法要么对理性做出不切实际的假设，要么计算成本过高难以快速适应，需要一种更高效准确的行为预测方法。

Method: 将日常社交互动建模为可预测的行为程序，使用LLM合成行为程序的假设空间，并通过概率推理处理不确定性。

Result: 在网格世界任务和大规模家庭模拟器中测试，ROTE在样本内准确性和样本外泛化能力上比行为克隆和LLM方法高出50%。

Conclusion: 将动作理解视为程序合成问题，为AI系统在现实世界中高效预测人类行为开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Motivation: 现有AI系统在化学工程领域存在跨学科合作不足和探索未知问题能力有限的问题，需要开发能够自主进化和发现的新型智能系统。

Method: 构建了集成领域知识库、知识增强技术和协作智能体的CA-ChemE系统，通过多智能体协作和本体工程能力促进跨学科合作。

Result: 知识库增强机制使7个专家智能体的对话质量评分平均提高10-15%；协作智能体干预使远领域专家对的协作效率提升8.5%，而近领域对仅提升0.8%，揭示了"知识库差距导致的协作效率降低"效应。

Conclusion: 精心设计的多智能体架构为化学工程领域的自主科学发现提供了可行路径，证明了智能系统在促进跨学科合作和科学探索方面的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

TL;DR: AGILE通过将拼图任务转化为交互式学习过程，显著提升了视觉语言模型的基本感知和推理能力，在2×2拼图任务中准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%，并在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面虽有进步，但在基本感知和推理能力上仍存在局限，即使在简单拼图任务上表现也接近随机。高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺性和有限可扩展性限制了这些能力的提升。

Method: 提出AGILE方法，将拼图求解构建为交互过程，模型在每个步骤生成可执行代码执行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈。通过观察和交互的迭代循环，模型通过探索和反馈逐步提升感知和推理能力。

Result: AGILE在复杂度不同的拼图任务上显著提升性能（2×2设置下准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%），并在9个通用视觉任务上表现出强泛化能力，平均提升3.1%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进多模态模型的推理和泛化能力开辟了新途径，并为多模态强化学习数据稀缺问题提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

TL;DR: MEMTRACK是一个用于评估多平台代理环境中长期记忆和状态跟踪的基准测试，模拟真实组织工作流程，整合Slack、Linear和Git等平台的异步事件，测试记忆获取、选择和冲突解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文和记忆基准测试主要关注对话场景，但企业动态环境中的记忆评估对于实际应用至关重要，需要超越对话设置的评估框架。

Method: 通过专家手动设计和基于代理的可扩展合成方法构建MEMTRACK数据集，创建基于真实软件开发过程的生态有效场景，包含跨平台交错时间线和噪声、冲突、交叉引用信息。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM和记忆后端在利用长期记忆、处理跨平台依赖和解决矛盾方面面临挑战，表现最好的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上仅达到60%的正确性得分。

Conclusion: 该工作为记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了可扩展框架，超越了现有对话设置的关注，为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Motivation: 随着电子健康记录的快速扩展和临床决策复杂性的增加，需要数据驱动的决策支持工具来帮助临床医生进行处方决策，同时保持临床判断的核心地位。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）管道，整合自然语言处理和结构化临床输入，通过分析患者人口统计学、临床表现、症状、诊断信息和治疗历史等数据生成治疗建议。

Result: 初步评估使用去标识化和合成临床数据集，结果显示模型输出具有临床合理性和一致性，表明大语言模型工具在适当约束和严格验证下可为处方工作流程提供有价值的决策支持。

Conclusion: 这项工作是生成式AI融入真实世界临床决策的初步尝试，强调透明度、安全性以及与既定实践的一致性，为未来临床应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE方法来检测隐式奖励黑客行为，通过截断推理过程来量化模型努力程度，在数学推理和编程任务上显著优于现有监控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为（模型利用奖励函数漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是重大威胁，特别是隐式黑客行为会绕过现有推理链监控。

Method: TRACE方法通过逐步截断模型的推理链，强制模型在不同截断点回答，测量验证器通过率，计算准确率-长度曲线下面积来量化模型努力程度。

Result: 在数学推理任务上比最强的72B推理链监控提升65%以上，在编程任务上比32B监控提升30%以上，并能发现训练中的未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督监督方法，在当前监控方法无效的情况下有效检测隐式奖励黑客行为。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过蒸馏将推理时检索转化为学习能力的方法，在ALFWorld和WebShop基准测试中显著提升智能体性能，同时减少token使用量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM智能体在多步任务中的常见失败模式（如尝试不满足前提条件的动作、发出冗余命令、处理环境约束不当），避免检索增强生成的外部知识库维护和计算开销

Method: 三步管道：1) 从智能体失败中提取紧凑可重用的提示；2) 使用这些提示在情节开始时通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；3) 在移除提示字符串的轨迹上训练学生模型，强制内化而非记忆

Result: 在ALFWorld上达到91%成功率（基线为79%），WebShop得分提升至72（基线为61），token使用量比检索增强教师减少10-60%

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模（7B/14B参数）和智能体架构（ReAct/StateAct）上具有通用性，证明检索优势可以通过针对性微调有效内化，无需永久运行时依赖

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大潜力，能显著减少人工工作量，同时达到或超越现有预测性能标准。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

TL;DR: OntoLogX是一个基于大语言模型的自主AI代理，可将原始系统日志转换为基于本体的知识图谱，并通过RAG和迭代校正确保生成的知识图谱在语法和语义上有效，最终映射到MITRE ATT&CK战术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志是宝贵的网络威胁情报来源，但由于缺乏结构化、语义不一致和设备间碎片化等问题，其实际效用受限。需要能够将噪声、异构数据协调为连贯且可互操作表示的方法。

Method: OntoLogX集成了轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成(RAG)和迭代校正步骤，确保生成的知识图谱有效。系统将知识图谱聚合为会话，并使用LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术。

Result: 在公共基准和真实世界蜜罐数据集上的评估表明，OntoLogX能够在多个知识图谱后端上稳健生成知识图谱，并准确将对抗活动映射到ATT&CK战术。检索和校正提高了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中表现有效，基于本体的表示为可操作的网络威胁情报提取提供了价值。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

TL;DR: Falconer是一个结合LLM智能推理与轻量级代理模型的可扩展知识挖掘框架，通过LLM作为规划器和标注器，训练小型代理模型执行分类和提取任务，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模知识挖掘中LLM部署成本过高，而传统分类器-提取器管道虽然高效但脆弱且无法泛化到新任务的问题。

Method: Falconer框架让LLM作为规划器分解用户指令为可执行管道，作为标注器生成监督数据训练小型代理模型，统一分类和提取为两个原子操作：get label和get span。

Result: Falconer在指令跟随准确率上接近最先进的LLM，同时减少推理成本达90%，加速大规模知识挖掘超过20倍。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了一个高效且可扩展的基础框架，实现了LLM智能推理与轻量级模型效率的平衡。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态语言模型时，将视觉输入视为固定确定性条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的模糊性，导致策略对合理视觉变化缺乏鲁棒性，探索效率低下。

Method: VOGUE方法将图像视为随机上下文，使用对称KL散度量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，创建不确定性感知的探索信号。结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样调度，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时提高pass@4性能并缓解RL微调中常见的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性来引导探索是提升多模态推理的有效策略，VOGUE方法通过将探索从输出空间转移到输入空间，显著改善了多模态强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: AIReg-Bench是首个用于评估大型语言模型在欧盟AI法案合规性评估方面表现的基准数据集，包含120个由LLM生成并经法律专家标注的技术文档样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着政府对AI的监管加强，需要评估LLM在AI法规合规性判断方面的能力，但目前缺乏相应的基准测试工具。

Method: 通过两步流程创建数据集：(1)使用结构化指令提示LLM生成120个虚构但合理的AI系统技术文档样本；(2)法律专家审查并标注每个样本是否违反AI法案的具体条款。

Result: 创建了AIReg-Bench数据集，并评估了前沿LLM在重现专家合规标签方面的表现，为理解LLM在AI法规合规评估中的机会和局限性提供了起点。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在AI法规合规评估中的应用建立了首个基准，数据集和评估代码已开源，可供后续研究比较使用。

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LToT是一种改进的Tree-of-Thoughts搜索控制器，通过分离效用与逻辑一致性，将低效用但一致的候选视为资产而非浪费，从而解决广度饱和和深度短视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代部署中大量测试时计算存在两个问题：广度饱和（额外样本产生近似重复）和深度短视（噪声短期效用修剪了长期有回报的分支）。

Method: LToT将前沿分为主线（高效用候选用于开发）和侧线（一致但初始低效用候选），通过侧向竞赛与短路机制探索侧线，使用带重复确认的宽度感知阈值。

Result: 理论证明侧向成本为伪线性Θ(N₀ log_η N₀)，相比未限制主线的指数增长显著改善。

Conclusion: LToT将大量测试时预算转化为原则性多样性，同时保持提升纪律，缓解饱和和短视问题而不增加计算成本。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用稀疏自编码器和聚类技术分析LLM内部token表示的方法，通过构建token转移图来指导数学推理任务中的生成过程，平衡利用和探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了分析大型语言模型在数学推理任务中的内部表示，并指导生成过程实现利用和探索的平衡，避免极端行为。

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器生成稀疏向量表示，应用k-means聚类构建token转移图，基于边权重定义奖励函数量化推理轨迹的遵循程度，同时通过聚类多样性评估探索程度。

Result: 研究发现平衡利用和探索对数学推理任务的高准确性至关重要，稀疏自编码器可作为可扩展的奖励模型指导生成过程。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡利用和探索，防止极端行为，促进LLM中更高质量的推理过程。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LOGicalThought (LogT)的神经符号架构，结合高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM，构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文，将长格式指南的推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域如法律和医学中，高保证推理需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的结论。这些推理依赖于从规则、法规和合同中编码的前提，由于众多例外情况，涉及可废止或非单调逻辑，单个事实的引入可能使一般规则失效，带来重大挑战。

Method: 使用高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM结合，构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文，将长格式指南的推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估。

Result: 在四个多领域基准测试中与四个基线相比，LogT在所有LLM上的整体性能提高了11.84%。在三种推理模式上的性能显著提升：否定推理最高提升+10.2%，蕴含推理+13.2%，可废止推理+5.5%。

Conclusion: LogT通过神经符号方法有效解决了高保证文本指南中的逻辑推理挑战，特别是在涉及否定、蕴含和可废止规则及例外的复杂逻辑结构方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

TL;DR: InfoSeeker是一个LLM决策框架，通过集成任务导向规划和信息寻求来解决部分可观测环境中的不确定性，在观察和环境动态方面都实现最优决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划代理虽然解决了观测不确定性，但往往忽略内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，需要主动寻求信息来更新内部动态并指导决策。

Method: InfoSeeker提示LLM主动收集信息，通过规划行动来验证理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后再生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 在包含不完全观测和不确定动态的部分可观测环境基准测试中，InfoSeeker相比先前方法实现了74%的绝对性能提升，且不牺牲样本效率。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了紧密集成规划和信息寻求对于在部分可观测环境中实现稳健行为的重要性。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励，可能强化导致偶然正确结果的错误推理路径，这与推理的自然结构不匹配。

Method: 首先提出理论框架将复杂问题解决形式化为层次选择过程，然后引入SAPO算法，使用过程奖励函数引导扩散语言模型的去噪过程与潜在推理层次对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在挑战性推理基准上显著提升性能，并增强了生成过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于理论框架的SAPO算法能够有效引导扩散语言模型学习结构化推理，提升复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

Motivation: 解决患者术前问题咨询的个性化需求与临床工作流程时间压力、隐私限制之间的矛盾，提供安全可靠的临床问答系统。

Method: 使用句子转换器分类器路由输入，从临床医生整理的FAQ中返回逐字答案，避免自由文本生成，在临床路径中实现非生成式回答。

Result: 在拔牙和胃镜检查两个领域测试中，E5-large-instruct模型达到0.983准确率，AUC 0.996，仅7个错误，与GPT-4o性能相当。非生成式临床路径能耗仅为1.0 mWh/输入，比本地8B SLM低170倍。

Conclusion: 通过返回经过验证的FAQ答案，LENOHA在临床路径中结构性地避免了前沿生成模型可能产生的错误，支持隐私保护、可持续性和在带宽受限环境中的公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大语言模型具备逆向思维能力的方法，通过预先分析潜在危害及其后果来生成更安全的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，但缺乏对潜在风险的系统性思考。InvThink旨在通过逆向推理让模型在生成响应前主动考虑失败模式。

Method: 1) 列举潜在危害，2) 分析后果，3) 生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM家族中实现。

Result: 安全改进随模型规模扩展更强；减轻安全税，保持标准基准上的通用推理能力；在高风险领域（医疗、金融、法律等）有害响应减少15.7%。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了可扩展和泛化的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

TL;DR: AdvEvo-MARL是一个协同进化的多智能体强化学习框架，通过内部化安全性到任务智能体中，而不是依赖外部防护模块，来防御多智能体系统中的越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统防御方法存在不足：自我验证方法因单个智能体缺乏检测跨智能体不安全链的能力而表现不佳；外部防护模块会增加系统开销并创建单点故障。

Method: 提出AdvEvo-MARL框架，联合优化攻击者（合成进化越狱提示）和防御者（训练任务智能体既完成任务又抵抗攻击），引入公共基线进行优势估计，同一功能组内的智能体共享组级平均回报基线。

Result: 在代表性攻击场景中，AdvEvo-MARL持续将攻击成功率保持在20%以下，而基线方法最高达到38.33%，同时保持甚至提高了任务准确性（在推理任务上最高提升+3.67%）。

Conclusion: 安全性和实用性可以在不依赖额外防护智能体或增加系统开销的情况下共同改进。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

*Thinh Hung Truong,Jey Han Lau,Jianzhong Qi*

TL;DR: LLMs can read road network maps and perform navigation tasks through trajectory recovery, outperforming specialized models with strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在空间推理方面的能力，特别是能否理解道路网络地图并执行导航任务。

Method: 将轨迹恢复作为代理任务，使用GLOBALTRACE数据集（包含4000+真实轨迹），通过提示框架让LLMs在不访问外部导航工具的情况下生成有效路径。

Result: LLMs在轨迹恢复任务中优于现成基线和专业轨迹恢复模型，表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，但对不同区域和交通方式存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs能够通过灵活推理地图来增强导航体验，整合用户偏好，展示了在空间推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了计算机使用代理(CUAs)存在盲目目标导向(BGD)偏差，即不顾可行性、安全性、可靠性和上下文地追求目标，并开发了BLIND-ACT基准来评估这种风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在GUI上执行操作以实现用户目标，但存在盲目追求目标的系统性偏差，这可能带来安全风险。

Method: 开发BLIND-ACT基准，包含90个任务捕捉BGD的三种模式，基于OSWorld提供真实环境，使用LLM评估代理行为。

Result: 评估9个前沿模型发现平均BGD率高达80.8%，提示干预能降低但风险仍然存在。观察到执行优先偏见、思维行动脱节和请求优先等失败模式。

Conclusion: 识别BGD并引入BLIND-ACT为研究和减轻这种基本风险奠定了基础，确保CUA的安全部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要依赖对人类智能直觉设计的合成任务，这些方法在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估框架。

Method: 提出基于数据科学实践的替代设计哲学，专注于评估系统的稳健任务执行能力，而非依赖直觉设计的合成任务。

Result: 提供了这种评估方法在实际AGI评估中的具体示例和应用。

Conclusion: AGI评估应转向以能力为导向的评估框架，通过展示系统的可靠部署能力来证明AGI的实现。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好微调方法忽略了合成偏好标注中普遍存在的风格和长度偏差噪声，需要更高质量的训练数据来提升模型对齐效果。

Method: 基于LLM引导的响应编辑框架生成硬负响应，保持与接受响应在风格和长度上的相似性，构建了包含30K高质量样本的VaPR数据集。

Result: 在三个LVLM家族上实现显著性能提升：LLaVA平均提升6.5%，Qwen2VL提升4.0%，Qwen2.5VL提升1.5%，特别是在推理任务上表现突出，并减少了二元问题中的"是"回答倾向。

Conclusion: VaPR框架有效解决了合成偏好数据中的偏差问题，可扩展到开源LLM作为编辑器，为LVLM的对齐提供了高质量的训练数据解决方案。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

TL;DR: MetaboT是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体AI系统，能够将用户的自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询语言，用于操作代谢组学知识图谱，显著提高了查询准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代谢组学质谱分析产生大量数据，知识图谱可以结构化这些数据，但使用知识图谱需要深入了解其本体和查询语言语法，这构成了技术障碍。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，使用LangChain和LangGraph库集成LLM与外部工具，通过专门的智能体处理用户查询、验证问题、识别化学转换需求，并生成SPARQL查询。

Result: 在50个代谢组学相关问题的测试中，MetaboT达到83.67%的准确率，而仅使用GPT-4o的基线方法只有8.16%的准确率。

Conclusion: MetaboT作为对话式问答助手，通过自动化SPARQL查询生成和执行，消除了访问知识图谱的技术障碍，同时保持实验基础的查询生成，确保输出符合领域特定标准。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的推理过程受限于自回归的token级生成，缺乏全局规划，导致推理冗余、不连贯或不准确。现有方法如树算法和RL计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）使用先进LLM将CoT提炼为紧凑高层指导进行SFT；2）引入指导感知RL方法联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试（MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025、AMC）和不同基础模型（Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct、Qwen3-8B、Qwen3-14B、LLaMA3.2-3B）上均取得稳定显著改进。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO能有效提升LLM的推理能力，在不同模型和任务上均表现出良好的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新构建和操作化对抗性逆强化学习到大型语言模型推理中，直接从专家演示中学习密集的token级奖励模型，而不是通过监督微调模仿风格。

Method: 使用对抗性逆强化学习方法学习密集的token级推理奖励模型，该模型在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评者重新排序采样轨迹。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，使用Llama3和Qwen2.5骨干网络证明：密集推理奖励可用作学习信号来引发推理；通过奖励引导的重新排序提高了预测性能（特别是基于Llama的策略）。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时间选择和token级诊断统一到单个推理奖励中，这项工作表明可重用的过程级奖励具有增强语言模型中多步推理的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CARS的约束自适应拒绝采样方法，在保持语言模型分布不变的前提下，通过自适应剪枝技术提高约束生成的采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪约束解码会扭曲语言模型分布，而拒绝采样虽然保真但计算效率低下。在程序模糊测试等领域，既需要样本有效性又需要多样性。

Method: CARS从无约束语言模型采样开始，通过构建trie数据结构记录违反约束的延续序列，并从未来采样中减去这些序列的概率质量，实现自适应剪枝。

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域的实验中，CARS在采样效率（每个有效样本所需的语言模型前向传递次数）和样本多样性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CARS方法严格提升了拒绝采样的效率而不产生分布失真，确保了约束分布下的精确采样，同时提高了样本多样性。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决定在所有学科中持续占多数结果(>50%)，'拒绝'率动态适应领域特定规范，在健康科学中上升至45%；保持坚定的程序完整性，强制执行稳定的29%证据锚定合规率，在不同评审任务和科学领域中保持不变。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流信任提供关键基础设施，为科学界提供确保公平的透明工具，为出版策略师提供审计工作流程、管理完整性风险和实施基于证据治理的可扩展工具。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

TL;DR: ReTabAD是一个表格异常检测基准，通过恢复文本语义实现上下文感知的异常检测研究，提供20个带有结构化文本元数据的表格数据集和零样本LLM框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准缺乏文本语义上下文，无法充分利用领域知识进行检测，限制了研究灵活性。

Method: 提供20个带有文本元数据的表格数据集，实现包括经典、深度学习和LLM方法在内的先进异常检测算法，并提出零样本LLM框架。

Result: 实验表明语义上下文能提高检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理增强可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD为系统探索上下文感知异常检测建立了基准，展示了文本元数据在异常检测中的作用和实用性。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

*Xinyuan Song,Keyu Wang,PengXiang Li,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对LLM深度层作用的系统性研究发现，深度层的贡献高度依赖于评估设置：基于似然的评估中浅层足够，而生成任务需要中层和深层来支持推理和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为LLM深层对表示学习贡献有限且可移除，但这些结论基于狭窄评估，可能忽略了模型行为的重要方面。

Method: 系统研究深度层在不同维度（评估协议、任务类别、模型架构）的利用情况，分析不同层在知识、推理、生成等任务中的作用。

Result: 深层通常比浅层效果差，但其贡献因评估设置而异：基于似然的评估中大部分层可剪枝，而生成评估显示中层和深层对推理和长程连贯性不可或缺。

Conclusion: LLM深度利用具有高度异质性和上下文依赖性，需要在解释和压缩大模型时考虑任务、指标和模型感知的视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 虽然某些AI模型在ConceptARC基准测试中达到了人类水平的输出准确率，但通过细粒度规则分析发现，这些模型主要依赖表面模式而非真正的抽象推理能力。在文本模态中，模型的抽象推理能力被高估；在视觉模态中，虽然准确率下降但模型仍能生成有意义的抽象规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估AI模型是否真正具备抽象推理能力，而非仅仅通过表面模式匹配在基准测试中获得高分。OpenAI的o3-preview模型在ARC-AGI基准上超越了人类准确率，但研究者质疑这是否代表模型真正理解了任务设计者意图的抽象概念。

Method: 在ConceptARC基准上评估模型，通过多种设置：输入模态（文本vs视觉）、是否允许使用外部Python工具、推理模型的推理努力程度。除了测量输出准确率，还对模型生成的自然语言规则进行细粒度评估，分析模型是否使用ConceptARC设计的抽象概念来解决问题。

Result: 在文本模态中，某些模型达到人类输出准确率，但生成的规则主要基于表面"捷径"，很少捕捉到预期的抽象概念。在视觉模态中，模型输出准确率显著下降，但规则分析显示模型仍能生成相当比例捕捉预期抽象的规则，只是无法正确应用这些规则。

Conclusion: 仅基于准确率评估ARC类任务的抽象推理能力可能高估文本模态中的能力，而低估视觉模态中的能力。模型在抽象推理方面仍落后于人类，需要更全面的评估框架来准确衡量多模态模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

TL;DR: FlexDoc是一个可扩展的合成数据生成框架，通过随机模式和参数化采样生成多语言半结构化文档，显著降低文档理解模型的标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大量多样化标注数据，但实际收集面临隐私限制、法律约束和高昂标注成本（可达数百万美元）的挑战。

Method: 结合随机模式和参数化采样，通过概率建模布局模式、视觉结构和内容变异性，实现可控的大规模多样化文档变体生成。

Result: 在关键信息提取任务中，使用FlexDoc生成的数据将绝对F1分数提高了11%，同时相比传统硬模板方法减少90%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: FlexDoc已在生产环境中部署，加速了企业级文档理解模型的开发，同时显著降低了数据获取和标注成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估维度、响应格式和评分机制方面存在不足，无法有效评估从封闭语言模型向具有外部感知和信息整合能力的互联代理系统转变的新型AI系统。

Method: 构建包含214个专家策划查询的基准测试，分布在10个广泛主题领域，每个查询配有手动构建的参考包。开发多维评估框架，整合语义质量、主题聚焦和检索可信度的评分指标。

Result: 实验证实主流DRAs在复杂和开放式任务上优于网络搜索工具增强的推理模型，但仍存在显著的改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构优化和范式进步提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

TL;DR: UpSafe°C是一个通过安全感知升级来增强LLM安全性的统一框架，通过识别安全关键层并将其升级为稀疏MoE结构，结合两阶段SFT策略和安全温度机制，实现安全与效用的动态平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全技术（外部防护、推理时引导、训练后对齐）在平衡安全性、效用和可控性方面存在局限性，需要一种更动态、模块化的安全增强方法。

Method: 识别安全关键层并升级为稀疏MoE结构，路由器作为软防护栏选择性激活原始MLP和新增安全专家；采用两阶段SFT策略；引入安全温度机制实现推理时灵活控制。

Result: 在多个基准测试、基础模型和模型规模上，UpSafe°C实现了对有害和越狱输入的鲁棒安全改进，同时在通用任务上保持竞争力；安全温度机制实现了效用与安全性的帕累托最优边界。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM安全指出了新方向：从静态对齐转向动态、模块化和推理感知的控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）在提升大语言模型推理能力时反而会缩小推理边界的现象，并提出了针对低概率问题的数据筛选算法来改善Pass@k性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR被广泛用于提升大语言模型的推理能力，但近期证据表明它可能反而会缩小推理边界而非扩展它，本文旨在深入探究这一收缩问题的根本原因。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，揭示了RLVR中的负干扰现象和赢家通吃现象，并基于这些洞察提出了专注于低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Result: 研究发现RLVR会导致负干扰（学习解决某些训练问题会降低其他问题正确解决的可能性）和赢家通吃现象（过度强化高概率问题而抑制低概率问题），提出的数据筛选算法显著提升了Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RLVR的收缩问题源于标准强化学习目标中的固有策略采样，导致模型收敛于狭窄的解决策略，通过专注于低概率问题的数据筛选可以有效改善这一现象。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at
https://github.com/mail-research/SELF-llm-interference.

Motivation: 计算机使用代理在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高方差阻碍了在长期复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN方法通过生成多个执行轨迹，并使用描述代理执行过程的行为叙述来进行轨迹选择，实现了广泛探索和原则性选择。

Result: 在OSWorld上达到69.9%的新SOTA，接近人类水平的72%，在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 有效扩展计算机使用代理需要结构化的轨迹理解和选择，bBoN提供了一个实用的框架来实现这一目标。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Motivation: 当前大模型的推理轨迹往往无法一致地捕捉或重用程序，而是陷入冗长和退化的探索，需要更有效的推理方法

Method: 引入推理抽象概念，训练模型能够为问题提出多个抽象描述，然后使用强化学习激励在利用这些抽象信息的基础上构建解决方案

Result: RLAD方法实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力

Conclusion: 推理抽象能有效引导有意义的探索，在测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更有利于性能提升

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge提供了一种计算高效的生物信号跨模态知识迁移解决方案，显著降低了模型复杂度，同时保持了优越的性能。

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
