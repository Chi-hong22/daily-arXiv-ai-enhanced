Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法来分类全景X射线图像中的牙齿状况，发现CNN与随机森林的混合模型表现最佳，准确率达到85.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化牙齿状况分类系统，为牙科诊断提供计算机辅助支持，提高诊断效率和准确性

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像数据集，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN特征提取与传统分类器混合模型、微调预训练模型，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型准确率最高（85.4%），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）；预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%）

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的有效途径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐解决大模型零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，在保持结构的同时显著提升外观保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射不准确

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射、Key-Value重排增强特征对应、使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更准确的语义对齐方案

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存误差的两个主要来源（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用残差分析、动态调整积分区间和线性化误差建模等方法，在保持生成质量的同时实现2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，虽然特征缓存可以加速推理，但简单的缓存重用会导致明显的质量下降。需要系统分析缓存误差的来源并设计有效的误差修正方法。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分区间；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存引起的误差；4）联合校正两种误差类型实现高效采样。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现了高达2倍的推理加速，同时保持甚至提升了视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，实现2倍加速且VBench指标下降极小，有效保持了基线保真度。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统分析缓存误差机制并设计相应的校正策略，成功解决了扩散模型缓存加速中的质量下降问题，为扩散模型的高效推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询，有效提升视频大语言模型的时间语义理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和训练监督不充分，无法抓取细粒度的时间语义信息

Method: 提出TVS方法：(1)保留重要视频段落 (2)同步重构查询保持答案一致性 (3)维持答案不变性和一致性

Result: 在视频剪辑任务上F-1分数提升0.47，训练效果提升7.33%，推理效果提升34.6%

Conclusion: TVS方法能够有效优化视频-语言理解的计算负荷分配，显著提升模型的时间信息处理能力

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用骨骼姿态标注作为手术工具定位的标注方法，创建了ROBUST-MIPS数据集，并验证了姿态标注在手术工具定位任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的手术工具分割方法受限于标注数据的多样性。骨骼姿态标注在语义信息丰富度和标注效率之间取得了更好的平衡，能够加速标注数据的增长。

Method: 从现有ROBUST-MIS数据集创建了ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割标注。使用流行的姿态估计方法建立基准测试，并发布了自定义工具姿态标注软件。

Result: 实验观察到姿态标注方法在手术工具定位任务中能够产生高质量的结果，证明了这种标注方式的充分性。

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是手术工具定位任务中一种高效且有效的标注方法，新发布的数据集和工具将促进该标注方式的采用和相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，在锁定T2I模型中注入安全控制信号，有效减少不安全内容生成，同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，且需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更灵活有效的安全解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁形式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并为统一补丁。

Result: 在6个不同T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他7种最先进安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control提供了一种有效、灵活且兼容性强的安全解决方案，能够显著降低T2I模型的不安全内容生成风险，适用于类似去噪架构的各种T2I模型。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，专门处理stuff-type目标区域的存在预测和分割问题，在真实世界环境中表现出优异的零样本迁移性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要开发能够同时预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码的方法。

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法，在五个不同地理位置的四个真实汽车上进行的实验验证了其零样本迁移性能，表现出跨多样化真实世界环境的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV方法有效解决了stuff-type目标区域的识别挑战，在真实世界导航任务中表现出卓越的性能和泛化能力，为移动设备的自然语言导航提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思维的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启用思维过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会使用逐步思维过程，造成计算资源浪费，需要一种能够自适应决定是否思考的模型来提高效率。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，让模型同时具备思维和非思维能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)来提升模型判断是否激活思维过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行策略优化。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务上超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大的16B模型性能相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思维机制成功解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的RGB、热成像和深度数据融合框架，用于检测遮挡或伪装目标，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的多模态方法来解决隐藏或部分遮挡物体的检测挑战。

Method: 提出HiddenObject融合框架，使用Mamba-based融合机制整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，捕获跨模态的互补信号，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构可以显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现椎体级别的CT/X射线配准，解决了传统方法的空间信息丢失和域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT/X射线配准在图像引导导航中具有高精度和实时性要求，传统"渲染比较"方法存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，而现有双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声X射线处理困难。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含双平面X射线椎体辐射高斯重建模块，采用基于学习的辐射高斯重建方法和反事实注意力学习机制，专注于噪声X射线中的椎体区域，并使用患者特定的预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合3D重建和配准，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的挑战，为图像引导导航提供了高精度和实时性的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D是一个包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的大型多模态数据集，提供LoD 4级别的语义注释，支持三种数据模态：3D线框图、平面图和LiDAR式屋顶点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要创建大规模合成数据集来推动该领域发展。

Method: 创建包含超过620万个合成3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4语义增强3D线框图、对应平面图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义注释从平面图像中推导，包含房间、门窗信息。

Result: 成功构建了SYNBUILD-3D数据集，这是一个大规模、多样化、多模态的合成3D建筑数据集，为开发生成式AI算法提供了基础资源。数据集和代码样本已公开可用。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D的三模态特性使未来工作能够开发新颖的生成式AI算法，在预定义平面布局和屋顶几何条件下自动化创建LoD 4级别的3D建筑模型，同时保持语义-几何一致性。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的方法来同时估计单应性和径向畸变，解决了三种不同的畸变配置情况，并开发了快速、稳定、准确的最小求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉中，单应性估计是许多任务的关键步骤。真实图像通常存在镜头畸变，特别是径向畸变，需要同时估计单应性和畸变才能获得有用结果。过去的方法分别处理三种不同的畸变配置，缺乏统一的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法来解决三种径向畸变配置：(i)仅一幅图像有畸变，(ii)两幅图像有相同畸变，(iii)两幅图像有独立畸变。基于该方法构建了新的快速、稳定、准确的最小求解器。

Result: 在所有三种情况下，提出的求解器比现有最先进求解器更快，同时保持相似的精度。在包括鱼眼相机图像的成熟基准测试中进行了验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，开发的求解器在速度和精度方面都表现出色，适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决跨层概念不一致问题，提高概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAV在不同层独立计算时存在概念表示不一致的问题，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来确保概念语义的一致性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局整合的CAV，并提出TGCAV方法应用于GCAV表示。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，帮助理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，通过结合LLM和视觉基础模型，使模型能够从少量示例中直接泛化到未见过的物体重识别类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前物体重识别方法缺乏泛化能力、需要大量标注数据的问题，以及自监督学习难以捕捉身份敏感特征的局限性。

Method: 使用LLM从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，然后通过动态视觉提示指导视觉基础模型（如DINO）提取身份判别特征，实现LLM语义概念与VFM预训练先验的对齐。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP框架通过视觉上下文提示实现了对未见类别的零样本泛化，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求，为物体重识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行评估，结果显示T1加权MRI任务DSC为0.56，T2加权MR-Linac任务DSC降至0.33，表明不同MRI序列对分割性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖结构变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型作为Auto3DSeg架构的一部分，在5折交叉验证基础上使用STAPLE集成方法，专注于解剖相关感兴趣区域。任务1使用91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI，任务2使用50例T2加权MR-Linac病例。

Result: 任务1：DSC 0.56，5 mm DSC 0.73，HD95 41.1mm，MASD 26.0mm，RMSE 5164mm；任务2：DSC 0.33，5 mm DSC 0.50，HD95 20.1mm，MASD 7.2mm，RMSE 17203mm。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明小数据集下MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性，不同MRI序列引入的变异性显著影响性能。尽管性能一般，但展示了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过逆向推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型难以在不同成像序列间泛化，主要原因是图像对比度的显著差异。虽然成像协议不同，但所有图像都由相同的自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）控制。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）通过解决非线性逆问题从观测图像逆向推断底层自旋属性；2）使用扩散模型学习mSASHA数据集中的自旋属性先验分布；3）基于推断的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MRI图像中获得近似但有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成。实验表明，Reverse Imaging能够在差异极大的图像对比度和成像协议间实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强和域适应方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定形状信息提高视频姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器作为形状条件3D姿态先验，显著提升绝对姿态准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为通用性优化，但过度依赖2D约束会损害3D精度，无法同时考虑个性化体型和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户体型，然后基于该体型进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现形状条件3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Result: 方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还显著改善了绝对姿态精度，且仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块增强现有3D姿态估计器性能。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦体型校准和姿态拟合过程，有效解决了传统方法过度依赖2D约束的问题，为个性化3D人体恢复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，采用分层时序剪枝策略，在保持运动动态的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真3D人体姿态方面表现出色，但其迭代特性和多假设需求导致计算成本过高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层时序剪枝(HTP)策略：1) 时序相关性增强剪枝(TCEP)通过自适应时序图构建分析帧间运动相关性；2) 稀疏聚焦时序多头注意力(SFT MHSA)利用帧级稀疏性减少注意力计算；3) 掩码引导姿态令牌剪枝器(MGPTP)通过聚类进行细粒度语义剪枝。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，HTP将训练MACs减少38.5%，推理MACs减少56.8%，推理速度平均提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分层剪枝策略有效解决了扩散模型的计算效率问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习算法的发展

Method: 三阶段框架：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本，预训练模型后在真实小数据集上微调，将等错误率从15.62%降至2.50%

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升生物识别性能

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集的发布将促进更先进的计算机视觉和机器学习方法在妇科腹腔镜手术视频分析中的发展

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Conclusion: 方法在手术器械分割任务上表现良好，但器械识别需要更多研究来应对器械间高度相似的挑战。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Conclusion: 提出的生成式方法成功解决了单图像3D场景重建中的遮挡和未观测区域问题，通过潜在扩散模型实现了高质量的多模态场景生成。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

TL;DR: 提出一种用于生物切片全正处理图像（WSI）的标准化索引地图框架，通过三层结构（来源、组织类型、病理改变）提供细粒度的图像内容描述，解决大规模WSI集合中手动检查效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前WSI图像缺乏标准化的元数据标准，在构建AI算法训练集时需要手动检查图像内容，这对包含数百万对象的大规模集合来说效率极低。

Method: 提出一个通用框架来生成WSI的2D索引地图，并为特定应用领域提供配置机制。通过三层结构（来源、组织类型、病理改变）对WSI内容进行细粒度分类和标注。

Result: 在临床病理学领域进行了实践验证，使用共同语法和语义实现了不同目录之间的互操性，并在WSI目录、机器学习和图基于表示中展示了其优势。

Conclusion: 该标准化框架能够有效地解决大规模WSI集合的内容索引和管理问题，为AI算法开发提供了高效的数据选择和处理方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，传统增量学习方法需要完全标注的数据集，这在实践中不现实

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签与多种CIL方法集成，通过置信度选择机制进行无监督增量学习

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，在细粒度数据集验证实用性，计算复杂度适合资源受限环境，最终准确率比state-of-the-art class-iNCD方法高5%以上

Conclusion: ICPL方法能够有效解决无标注数据的增量学习问题，性能与有监督方法相当，在现实场景中具有很好的实用性

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

TL;DR: MedShift是一个基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges的统一类条件生成模型，用于合成和真实X射线图像之间的跨域转换，解决了医学影像中的域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成医学数据虽然可扩展，但与真实临床设置存在显著域差距，限制了其在真实世界中的泛化能力。需要解决合成和真实X射线图像在衰减行为、噪声特征和软组织表示等方面的差异。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges构建统一的类条件生成模型。学习共享的域无关潜在空间，支持训练期间见过的任意域对之间的无缝转换，无需域特定训练或配对数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，MedShift在较小模型尺寸下仍能提供强大性能，在推理时保持灵活性，可以调整以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学影像中的域适应提供了一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，在X-DigiSkull新数据集上展示了优异的跨域转换性能。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有全球产品主要关注二元树冠覆盖或冠层高度，无法在个体水平识别树木，需要开发大规模单棵树监测方法

Method: 使用深度学习处理3米分辨率PlanetScope影像，用可缩放高斯核模拟树冠，从机载激光雷达自动提取数十亿个点进行训练

Conclusion: 该方法为全球高分辨率树木监测提供了可扩展框架，并能适应未来提供改进影像的卫星任务

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Result: 在保持优异视觉质量的同时，显著减少了训练时间，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: M框架为动态场景的高斯溅射提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，在训练效率和渲染质量方面都有显著提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级图像描述模型，参数量仅为125M，比LLaMA-7B小56倍，性能却能与大型多模态通用模型相媲美。同时开发了Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架来解决视觉盲区问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备部署。需要开发轻量级但性能相当的图像描述模型。

Method: 基于125M参数语言模型构建专家模型，并开发Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架，通过DeepLens组件提取详细视觉表示来改善视觉定位。

Result: 模型在单句和详细描述任务上表现优异，性能接近大型通用模型，框架有效缓解了视觉盲区问题。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架显著提升了描述质量。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法要么只关注单一技术家族，要么在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽视了组合多种现有解决方案的潜力

Method: 提出Multi-Method Ensemble (MME)评分方法，统一了最先进的OOD检测器，结合特征截断和多种评分函数

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，包括近OOD和远OOD场景，MME显著优于最新方法。使用BiT模型在ImageNet-1K基准上达到平均FPR95为27.57%，比现有最佳基线提升6%

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实证证明，最先进的特征截断和评分函数可以有效地结合，聚合多个评分函数能增强对各种类型OOD样本的鲁棒性

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Motivation: 现有的基于数据变换的对抗攻击方法可能因过度增强背景或无关区域而引入干扰，导致误检，这些错误并非由对抗补丁本身引起。

Method: 局部增强方法，仅对目标区域应用增强，避免影响非目标区域，使损失函数更直接关注对抗补丁对检测模型的影响。

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率并增强了迁移性。

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，使对抗攻击更专注于目标区域，显著提升了攻击效果和迁移能力。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个专门针对长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，系统研究了语义聚合幻觉(SAH)，发现SAH随语义复杂性增加，并提出位置编码策略和DPO训练方法来缓解SAH，在基准测试上实现了27.7%的SAH减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。之前的幻觉基准主要关注短视频，且将幻觉归因于语言先验、缺失帧或视觉编码器引入的偏差，但这些原因过于简化。特别是在长视频中，语义聚合过程中的幻觉问题变得尤为关键。

Method: 1) 引入ELV-Halluc基准，专门用于长视频幻觉研究；2) 确认SAH的存在并分析其与语义复杂性的关系；3) 探讨位置编码策略对缓解SAH的贡献；4) 采用DPO策略增强模型区分事件内外语义的能力；5) 构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，显示SAH随语义复杂性增加而增加，模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH。通过位置编码和DPO策略，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上都取得了改进，特别是实现了27.7%的SAH比率降低。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地研究了长视频中的语义聚合幻觉问题，提出了有效的缓解方法，为视频多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了新的研究视角和解决方案，特别是在处理复杂长视频内容方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Motivation: 现有的基于patch的基础模型特征在显微图像分析中存在两个问题：1）难以捕捉微结构中的精细特征；2）无法处理材料科学和生物图像中的大尺寸图像

Method: 训练卷积神经网络来上采样低分辨率的基础模型特征，参考输入图像信息，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微图像的特征提取和分割

Result: 该方法能够有效分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割只需极少标签就能产生高质量分割结果，比传统卷积网络训练快得多

Conclusion: 基于深度特征上采样的方法为显微图像分析提供了高效、高质量的解决方案，显著减少了标注需求并提高了分割精度

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，通过分层跨粒度对比和匹配学习实现了优异的检索性能和零样本泛化能力

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Conclusion: 城市空间推理是VLM的新挑战，通过合成数据集构建可以实现通用模型向专业领域的有效迅速适配

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: TFM是一种统一的生成式轨迹方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越了自然成像的时空方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学成像中的时间动态理解对于疾病进展建模、治疗计划和解剖发展跟踪至关重要，但现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间上下文或专注于分类/回归任务，限制了细粒度空间预测能力。

Method: 提出Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，这是一种生成式轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器作为特例。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像领域的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健基准。

Conclusion: TFM成功解决了医学图像时间动态建模的根本性差距，提供了一个统一的框架来处理复杂的4D医学图像预测任务，在多个数据集上表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个多模态深度学习框架，整合术前CT和术后病理切片图像来预测肾透明细胞癌的复发风险，发现病理图像模型优于CT模型，中间融合策略效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leibovich评分在肾透明细胞癌复发风险分层中应用广泛但存在局限性，缺乏患者层面的分辨率和影像学信息，需要开发更精准的多模态预测方法。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，使用预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中间融合三种设置，比较了不同模型在真实世界ccRCC队列中的表现。

Result: 病理切片模型始终优于仅使用CT的模型，中间融合进一步提升了性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。放射学通过融合增加了价值，但病理学显示出更强的预后能力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于基础模型的多模态整合在个性化ccRCC风险预测中的可行性，未来需要探索更具表现力的融合策略、更大的多模态数据集和通用CT编码器。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度展开网络(DUN)，通过自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复值去噪器(PCD)来解决计算机生成全息术中的非线性不适定问题，实现了超过35dB的PSNR和更宽的工作距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的CGH方法存在三个主要问题：(i)端到端网络忽略物理关系，降低可解释性和灵活性；(ii)CNN方法感受野有限，难以捕捉长距离依赖；(iii)基于角谱方法(ASM)的模型局限于有限近场。

Method: 提出深度展开网络(DUN)，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)允许更宽的工作距离，相位域复值去噪器(PCD)使用复值可变形自注意力模块捕捉全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上实现了最先进的性能，PSNR超过35dB，相比ASM方法具有更宽的工作距离范围。

Conclusion: DUN方法通过结合物理模型和深度学习，在保持可解释性的同时提升了CGH的重建性能和灵活性，为解决非线性不适定问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决全身PET/CT中由于示踪剂异质性、生理性摄取和多中心变异性导致的病灶分割困难问题，开发能够保持人机交互的半自动化分割方法。

Method: 扩展autoPET III获胜的nnU-Net框架，将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道；系统研究空间提示表示方法；提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略；使用欧几里得距离变换编码。

Result: 基于EDT的集成模型在交叉验证中表现最佳，相比基线模型减少了假阳性和假阴性；在真实提示条件下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提示式模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的概率投影机制，通过置信度分数来改进从图像空间到BEV空间的道路元素映射，提高HD地图生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用标准映射技术存在泛化问题，容易产生幻觉道路元素，需要更精确的映射方法

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，通过概率投影机制和置信度分数来细化映射并过滤无关元素，改进时间处理

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于现有方法，特别是在nuScenes和长感知范围场景中改进显著

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制能有效提高HD地图构建的准确性和泛化能力

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，而现代单词级OCR将精度瓶颈转移到了单词分割。论文识别到这是一个自然的进步机会，通过跳过单词检测步骤来提升性能。

Method: 提出了一种行级OCR方法，直接将整行文本作为输入，跳过单词分割步骤，利用更大的句子上下文来进行序列到序列的直接输出。

Conclusion: 行级OCR代表了OCR技术的自然进化路径，能够更好地利用语言模型和避免分割错误，为未来大语言模型的集成打下基础。论文还公开了一个精心编诒的251张英语页面图像的行级注释数据集。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: FLORA是一个轻量级的合成数据生成管道，使用LoRA微调Flux 1.1扩散模型，大幅降低计算需求，仅需消费级GPU和500张合成图像就能在目标检测任务上超越基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在数据增强时需要企业级GPU和大量合成图像的高计算成本问题，使合成数据生成更加实用和可访问。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）进行微调，构建轻量级合成数据生成管道。

Result: 在7个不同目标检测数据集上，仅用500张合成图像就超越了ODGEN基线使用5000张图像的性能，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了质量和效率导向的方法比暴力生成更有效，仅用10%的数据和一小部分计算成本就能达到最先进性能，使高级合成数据创建更加实用。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有对抗样本检测方法需要重新训练、修改网络架构或影响干净输入性能，而对抗扰动会在CNN激活层产生可检测的熵特征

Method: 在VGG-16上并行监测激活熵值，发现对抗输入在早期卷积层导致激活熵值产生7%的偏移

Result: 对抗样本与干净样本的熵分布完全分离，检测准确率达到90%，假阳性和假阴性率均低于20%

Conclusion: CNN可靠性可以通过激活熵单独评估，实现实时检测对抗样本的自诊断视觉系统，且不影响原始模型性能

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

Motivation: 当前基础模型的领域泛化评估面临挑战，web级预训练数据可能已覆盖现有测试集，无法真正测试未见数据场景

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：使用独立的领域头和综合生成的多样化领域数据来识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域意识，同时通过与领域特征解耦来促进领域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA在具有挑战性的评估中显示出显著改进，尤其是在更外部分布的数据集上，超越现有方法

Conclusion: 增强领域意识是基础模型中实现有效领域不变分类的前提条件，而非强制抛弃领域相关表征

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

TL;DR: 本文研究了非典型视频数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单的学习方法也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别任务中带来一致性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中展现出色的泛化和发现能力，但现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据，视频领域的开放世界新颖发现研究不足。本文探索非典型视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型视频数据的新数据集，将其用于模型训练过程中的表征学习，重点研究OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别三个关键任务。

Result: 实验表明：1) 非典型数据能一致提升各任务性能；2) 增加非典型样本的类别多样性可进一步提升OOD检测性能；3) 在NCD任务中，使用较小但语义更多样的非典型数据集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好；4) 在ZSAR任务中，非典型视频的语义多样性有助于模型更好地泛化到未见过的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界视觉表征学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集和发现鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

### [53] [Unsupervised Video Continual Learning via Non-Parametric Deep Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21773)
*Nattapong Kurpukdee,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)方法，通过核密度估计和新奇检测来处理无标签、无任务边界的视频学习问题，在多个标准数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的空间-时间信息，但在无监督持续学习领域很少被深入研究。之前的研究主要集中在有监督持续学习，依赖标签和任务边界知识，而这在实际应用中成本高且不实用。

Method: 提出使用核密度估计(KDE)来建模深度嵌入视频特征的非参数概率表示，通过新奇检测标准动态扩展内存集群，并利用过往任务的过移学习作为初始状态进行知识转移。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频动作识别数据集上进行了深入评估，在不使用任何标签或类别边界的情况下，方法在连续学习多个任务时显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无监督视频持续学习领域提供了一个可行的解决方案，通过非参数方法和动态内存管理有效地处理了视频数据的复杂性和计算挑战，为该领域的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用多阶段级联预训练策略，通过数据增强和模型集成方法，在胰腺导管腺癌MRI分割任务中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌MRI自动分割面临肿瘤-组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据下高性能的专门化模型

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上微调。通过五折交叉验证评估数据增强方案，构建定制化异构集成模型

Result: Task 1获得0.661的Tumor Dice分数，Task 2获得0.523的Tumor Dice分数。Task 1达到最先进的MASD 5.46 mm和HD95 17.33 mm边界精度

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务中开发专门化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达92.8%，显著超越GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实临床场景中生成的治疗建议也获得较高评价，但仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5这一专门针对肿瘤学优化的大型语言模型在临床决策支持中的实际表现，特别是在放射肿瘤学这一专业领域的应用潜力。

Method: 使用两个互补基准进行评估：1）ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试的300道选择题；2）60个真实放射肿瘤学临床案例，由4名认证放射肿瘤学家评估生成治疗建议的正确性、全面性和幻觉情况。

Result: GPT-5在选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)。在临床案例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见但存在实质性错误，评分者间一致性较低。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现出色，明显优于前代模型，但在复杂临床场景中仍有改进空间，生成的治疗建议需要严格的专家监督才能临床使用。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

TL;DR: 提出了TMUAD框架，通过文本记忆库、对象级图像记忆库和补丁级记忆库的三重记忆机制，统一处理结构性和逻辑性异常检测，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间的逻辑关系，但正常数据有限且难以充分捕获复杂的逻辑异常模式。

Method: 构建三个互补的记忆库：1）类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2）对象级图像记忆库保持完整对象轮廓；3）补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测。通过多级检索和比较计算异常分数并融合。

Result: 在7个公开数据集（工业和医疗领域）上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过协作式记忆库统一结构性和逻辑性异常检测是有效的，TMUAD框架为解决复杂异常检测问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

TL;DR: VoCap是一个灵活的视频模型，能够处理视频和多种模态提示（文本、框或掩码），生成时空掩码和对应的物体中心描述，同时解决可提示视频物体分割、参考表达式分割和物体描述任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵。

Method: 通过在现有大规模分割数据集（SAV）上使用伪物体描述进行标注，利用大型视觉语言模型处理带真实掩码的视频来突出感兴趣物体，并收集手动标注进行无偏评估。

Result: 在参考表达式视频物体分割上达到最先进结果，在半监督视频物体分割上具有竞争力，并为视频物体描述建立了基准。

Conclusion: VoCap模型通过多数据集训练实现了优秀的性能，相关数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但忽略了视觉事件识别中固有的语义模糊性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述。

Method: 将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习(SPMLL)问题，提出Graph Enhanced Verb MLP模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在保持传统top-1和top-5准确率竞争力的同时，实现了超过3%的MAP改进。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了场景识别中的语义模糊性问题，为多标签评估建立了新基准。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调和预训练可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解。需要评估LLM是否能够通过真实的驾驶知识测试，识别各种边缘案例。

Method: 开发了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉版本(DriveQA-V)，涵盖交通法规和场景。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调和预训练研究。

Result: 现有模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点。微调后准确率提升，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面。预训练还能提升下游驾驶任务性能。

Conclusion: DriveQA为评估驾驶AI系统提供了全面基准，显示通过专门的训练可以显著提升模型对交通知识的理解和泛化能力，为开发更安全的自动驾驶系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Abstract: This study proposes a framework that employs personality prompting with Large
Language Models to generate verbal and nonverbal behaviors for virtual agents
based on personality traits. Focusing on extraversion, we evaluated the system
in two scenarios: negotiation and ice breaking, using both introverted and
extroverted agents. In Experiment 1, we conducted agent to agent simulations
and performed linguistic analysis and personality classification to assess
whether the LLM generated language reflected the intended traits and whether
the corresponding nonverbal behaviors varied by personality. In Experiment 2,
we carried out a user study to evaluate whether these personality aligned
behaviors were consistent with their intended traits and perceptible to human
observers. Our results show that LLMs can generate verbal and nonverbal
behaviors that align with personality traits, and that users are able to
recognize these traits through the agents' behaviors. This work underscores the
potential of LLMs in shaping personality aligned virtual agents.

Motivation: 研究巴西儿童如何使用对话助手进行学习和娱乐，以及如何通过结构化脚手架改善这些交互质量

Method: 研究1：进行7周在线研究，采用访谈、观察和认知工作分析来映射儿童信息处理流程。研究2：在1,200个模拟儿童-对话助手交换中测试GPT-4o-mini，比较结构化提示与无结构基线

Result: 识别了对话助手的三种功能：学校、探索、娱乐，并派生了模仿父母-子女支持的"方法组合"脚手架。结构化提示方法在可读性、问题数量/深度/多样性和语义连贯性方面都显示出更好的表现

Conclusion: 提出了设计建议：脚手架化对话树、专门的儿童设置文件以便个性化上下文，以及照顾者精选内容。这是首次在巴西儿童中应用CWA方法的研究，为有效的脚手架学习提供了结构化提示方法

Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use
conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and
how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a
seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,
teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map
children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,
functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform
conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,
Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.
In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,
comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an
unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question
count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.
Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded
conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and
caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application
with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,
and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,
scaffolded learning.

Motivation: 阅读障碍影响5-10%人口，但社会普遍低估问题严重性且缺乏对支持方法重要性的认识。通过激发共情是提升意识的有效途径

Method: 创建虚拟现实严肃游戏，针对教育工作者、学生和非阅读障碍群体，模拟阅读障碍者面临的日常挑战，让玩家亲身体验困难

Result: 101名参与者测试显示，使用该VR工具后参与者的共情水平平均提升20%，证明该方法对促进对语音阅读障碍的共情理解高度有效

Conclusion: VR严肃游戏是提升对阅读障碍理解和共情的有效工具，有助于推动社会对支持方法重要性的认识，为阅读障碍者创造更公平的机会

Abstract: Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder estimated to strike approximately 5
to 10 per cent of the population. In particular, phonological dyslexia causes
problems in connecting the sounds of words with their written forms.
Consequently, affected individuals may encounter issues such as slow reading
speed, inaccurate reading, and difficulty decoding unfamiliar words. To address
these complexities, the use of compensatory tools and strategies is essential
to ensure equitable opportunities for dyslexic students. However, the general
underestimation of the issue and lack of awareness regarding the significance
of support methodologies pose significant obstacles. One of the ways to enhance
consciousness towards a certain issue is by stimulating empathy with whom is
affected by it. In light of this, this study introduces a serious game in
virtual reality, targeted at educators, students, and, in general, at the
non-dyslexic community. The game seeks to enhance understanding of the
challenges that individuals with dyslexia experience daily, highlighting the
relevance of supportive measures. This approach encourages players to empathize
with the struggles of dyslexic individuals and to learn firsthand the
importance of supportive methodologies. The final version of the experience was
tested by 101 participants and evaluated through a specific collection of
questionnaires validated in the literature. The results show that using the
proposed virtual reality tool to promote empathy for individuals with
phonological dyslexia is highly effective, leading to an average 20 per cent
increase in participants' empathy after playing the game.

Abstract: Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food
digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood
in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease.
Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more
research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing
spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial
communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited
functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results.
To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively
explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers
spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance
user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing
population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux
distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to
evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to
improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome
data in their spatial context.

Method: 通过为期两年的印度南部非营利组织参与式设计项目进行案例研究，该组织支持遭受家庭暴力或面临心理健康危机的女性。研究重点关注知识管理和传递方面的组织差距。

Result: 设计过程中发现组织内部存在维护种姓等级制度的实践，设计师拒绝将这些压迫性实践纳入技术方案，导致与合作伙伴关系破裂。

Conclusion: 提出了社区参与式设计师在应对价值冲突时可采取的多元路径：包括在参与前后创造反思空间、通过角色重构或欣赏式探询进行战略重新定位，以及在必要时退出合作。

Abstract: Community-based design efforts rightly seek to reduce the power differences
between researchers and community participants by aligning with community
values and furthering their priorities. However, what should designers do when
key community members' practices seem to enact an oppressive and harmful
structure? We reflect on our two-year-long engagement with a non-profit
organization in southern India that supports women subjected to domestic abuse
or facing mental health crises. We highlight the organizational gaps in
knowledge management and transfer, which became an avenue for our design
intervention. During design, we encountered practices that upheld caste
hierarchies. These practices were expected to be incorporated into our
technology. Anticipating harms to indirect stakeholders, we resisted this
incorporation. It led to a breakdown in our relationship with the partner
organization. Reflecting on this experience, we outline pluralistic pathways
that community-based designers might inhabit when navigating value conflicts.
These include making space for reflection before and during engagements,
strategically repositioning through role reframing or appreciative inquiry, and
exiting the engagement if necessary.

*Yi-Hao Peng,Dingzeyu Li,Jeffrey P. Bigham,Amy Pavel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Morae是一个为盲人和低视力用户设计的UI代理，能够在任务执行过程中识别决策点并暂停，让用户参与选择，提高用户自主权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UI代理通常端到端执行任务，不涉及用户在关键选择中的参与，也不让他们了解重要上下文信息，从而降低了用户自主权。

Method: 使用大型多模态模型解释用户查询、UI代码和截图，在需要做出选择时提示用户澄清，采用混合主动方法。

Result: 在真实网页任务研究中，Morae帮助用户完成更多任务并选择更符合偏好的选项，优于包括OpenAI Operator在内的基线代理。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了混合主动方法的价值，用户既能受益于UI代理的自动化，又能表达自己的偏好。

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

TL;DR: 研究通过20位AI计算机感知工具开发者的深度访谈，识别出4个关键设计优先级：情境解释性、工作流整合、用户定制化和创新平衡，强调开发者作为技术架构师和伦理管家的双重角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI计算机感知技术通过移动传感器收集行为生理数据用于临床决策，但如何平衡临床效用与用户接受度/可信度是有效整合到临床工作流程的关键挑战。

Method: 对20位AI计算机感知工具开发者进行深度访谈，采用归纳式主题分析方法，识别关键设计优先级。

Result: 识别出4个核心设计优先级：1)考虑情境并确保对患者和临床医生的可解释性；2)与现有临床工作流程对齐；3)为相关利益相关者适当定制以提高可用性和接受度；4)在创新与既定范式间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 开发者需要作为伦理管家，通过记录定制选择、定义定制限制、透明传达输出信息和投资用户培训来实现平衡，这需要开发者、临床医生和伦理学家之间的跨学科合作。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception (CP) technologies use
mobile sensors to collect behavioral and physiological data for clinical
decision-making. These tools can reshape how clinical knowledge is generated
and interpreted. However, effective integration of these tools into clinical
workflows depends on how developers balance clinical utility with user
acceptability and trustworthiness. Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth
interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools. Interviews were transcribed
and inductive, thematic analysis was performed to identify 4 key design
priorities: 1) to account for context and ensure explainability for both
patients and clinicians; 2) align tools with existing clinical workflows; 3)
appropriately customize to relevant stakeholders for usability and
acceptability; and 4) push the boundaries of innovation while aligning with
established paradigms. Our findings highlight that developers view themselves
as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools
that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing
objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following
suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around
customization are made, defining limits for customization choices,
transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user
training. Achieving these goals will require interdisciplinary collaboration
between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了赞助搜索拍卖中的冷启动问题，通过Thompson Sampling算法结合二价拍卖来优化探索策略，提出了根据关键词特征定制化探索的方法，显著提升了平台收入和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新广告主在赞助搜索拍卖中的冷启动问题，平台需要平衡探索和利用，但现有研究对拍卖环境中的最优探索策略了解不足。

Method: 利用亚洲领先移动应用商店的数据，采用Thompson Sampling算法在二价拍卖框架中学习质量分数，为每个关键词分配单一赞助位置，并量化探索优化的收益。

Result: 实证研究表明拍卖-老虎机组合问题与经典老虎机问题存在显著差异，提出的定制化探索策略能够根据关键词特征调整探索水平，在收入和效率指标上都实现了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过定制化的探索策略，平台可以在赞助搜索拍卖中有效解决冷启动问题，同时在收入和效率两个维度上都获得实质性收益，为平台提供了可行的政策建议。

Abstract: Sponsored search positions are typically allocated through real-time
auctions, where the outcomes depend on advertisers' quality-adjusted bids - the
product of their bids and quality scores. Although quality scoring helps
promote ads with higher conversion outcomes, setting these scores for new
advertisers in any given market is challenging, leading to the cold-start
problem. To address this, platforms incorporate multi-armed bandit algorithms
in auctions to balance exploration and exploitation. However, little is known
about the optimal exploration strategies in such auction environments. We
utilize data from a leading Asian mobile app store that places sponsored ads
for keywords. The platform employs a Thompson Sampling algorithm within a
second-price auction to learn quality scores and allocate a single sponsored
position for each keyword. We empirically quantify the gains from optimizing
exploration under this combined auction-bandit model and show that this problem
differs substantially from the canonical bandit problem. Drawing on these
empirical insights, we propose a customized exploration strategy in which the
platform adjusts the exploration levels for each keyword according to its
characteristics. We derive the Pareto frontier for revenue and efficiency and
provide actionable policies, demonstrating substantial gains for the platform
on both metrics when using a tailored exploration approach.

Conclusion: 一次性信息设计方法能有效克服传统信息设计的局限性，显著提高玩家行动配置向目标点的收敛性能。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented
two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a
specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first
characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we
establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always
achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear
payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments
required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred
with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a
one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game,
transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we
theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of
players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high
probability, and support it with empirical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未注册表面网格（特别是原始3D扫描数据）由于缺乏点对点对应关系和存在噪声，给自动计算合理变形带来了重大挑战。

Method: 结合鲁棒的运动嵌入网络和学习的每顶点特征场，生成时空变形场来驱动网格变形。

Result: 在行走、跑步等任务上的广泛评估（包括定量基准和定性可视化）证明了该方法在具有挑战性的未注册网格上的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理未注册体网格的运动预测和迁移提供了一个有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the
data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for
motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

TL;DR: 通过两种规则化策略（有效秩规则化和神经SDF）改进3D高斯拖晓的网格重建质量，提升了视觉保真度和场景一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如SuGaR虽能有效渲染，但在视觉保真度和场景一致性上仍有改进空间，需要解决单个高斯元形状和整体表面一致性的问题

Method: 1. 有效秩规则化：避免极端各异性（针状形态），促进更平衡的盘状形态以支持稳定表面重建
2. 神经SDF规则化：集成神经签名距离函数，使用Eikonal损失维持距离属性，提供连续全局表面前知来引导高斯元对齐

Result: 最终模型能够从3DGS数据中生成更准确和一致的视觉效果

Conclusion: 通过补充性的规则化策略，在SuGaR基础上显著提升了3D高斯拖晓的网格重建质量，同时改善了单个元素的保真度和整体表面行为

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WaveLLDM是一种轻量级潜在扩散模型，通过神经音频编解码器和潜在扩散的结合，在压缩潜在空间中处理音频，降低计算复杂度同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量音频在多种应用中至关重要，但噪声、压缩和传输伪影导致的音频退化仍是主要挑战。传统扩散模型需要大量计算资源且难以处理较长的缺失片段。

Method: 提出WaveLLDM架构，将高效的神经音频编解码器与潜在扩散相结合，在压缩潜在空间中进行音频修复和去噪，而不是在时间或频谱域操作。

Result: 在Voicebank+DEMAND测试集上，WaveLLDM实现了低对数频谱距离分数（0.48-0.60）的准确频谱重建，但对未见数据的感知质量和语音清晰度仍低于最先进方法（WB-PESQ:1.62-1.71, STOI:0.76-0.78）。

Conclusion: 虽然存在架构调优不足、缺乏微调和训练时间不足等限制，但结合神经音频编解码器和潜在扩散模型的灵活架构为未来发展提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including
online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However,
degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a
major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio
restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and
struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM
(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an
efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and
denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral
domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing
computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical
evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves
accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores
(0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still
underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual
quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and
STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to
suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient
training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a
neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for
future development.

Result: 开发出了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够在很少标签数据的情况下实现准确的活动识别和日常常规追踪

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了远程监护中的数据标签问题，提供了一种隐私保护、可扩展且准确的日常生活监测方案

Abstract: One in four people dementia live alone, leading family members to take on
caregiving roles from a distance. Many researchers have developed remote
monitoring solutions to lessen caregiving needs; however, limitations remain
including privacy preserving solutions, activity recognition, and model
generalizability to new users and environments. Structural vibration sensor
systems are unobtrusive solutions that have been proven to accurately monitor
human information, such as identification and activity recognition, in
controlled settings by sensing surface vibrations generated by activities.
However, when deploying in an end user's home, current solutions require a
substantial amount of labeled data for accurate activity recognition. Our
scalable solution adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to
pretrain a model and allows fine tuning with very limited data in order to
create a robust framework for daily routine tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频分类模型采用计算机视觉中的方形分块方法，破坏了频谱图的连续频率模式，产生过多分块导致训练缓慢和计算量过大

Method: FFTP分块策略：全频段覆盖+局部时间上下文，保持谐波结构；SpecMask增强：固定掩码预算下的全频段和局部时频掩码组合

Result: 在AST和AuM模型上应用，AudioSet-18k mAP提升最高+6.76，SpeechCommandsV2准确率提升最高+8.46，计算量减少最高83.26%

Conclusion: FFTP和SpecMask方法有效解决了频谱图时间频率不对称性问题，在提升音频分类性能的同时显著提高了计算效率

Abstract: Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification
by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such
as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square
patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and
produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing
computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching
strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by
spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving
harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We
also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines
full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget,
enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When
applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by
up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2,
while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and
efficiency gains.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了双分辨率注意力统计池化(DRASP)框架，通过结合粗粒度的全局统计摘要和细粒度的注意力分析，改进了音频MOS预测中的特征池化机制，在多个数据集和模型上显著优于传统池化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的池化方法通常在单一粒度上操作，要么关注全局视角，要么关注帧级分析，可能忽略了互补的感知信息，需要一种能够同时捕捉全局结构上下文和显著局部细节的池化机制。

Method: 提出双分辨率注意力统计池化(DRASP)框架，整合粗粒度的全局统计摘要和细粒度的注意力分析，对感知显著片段进行细致分析，形成更全面和鲁棒的特征表示。

Result: 在多个数据集(MusicEval和AES-Natural)、不同MOS预测模型(包括CLAP-based模型和AudioBox-Aesthetics)以及不同音频生成系统上，DRASP均优于各种基线方法，相比广泛使用的平均池化方法，系统级Spearman等级相关系数(SRCC)相对提升了10.39%。

Conclusion: DRASP框架通过双视图架构有效整合了全局和局部信息，在音频MOS预测任务中表现出优异的性能和强大的泛化能力，为音频质量评估提供了更有效的特征池化解决方案。

Abstract: A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction,
facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a
concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality.
Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity,
concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed
frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics
Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global
statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually
significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to
formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the
overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization
ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline
methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction
backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different
audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39% in
system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the
widely-used average pooling approach.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的缺失值揕补方法有效地解决了分布式光纤感知在拖江情况下的数据缺失问题，显著提高了该技术在广泛实际应用中的适用性和可靠性。

Abstract: This paper presents a traffic state estimation (TSE) method in congestion for
distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS). DFOS detects vehicle driving vibrations
along the optical fiber and obtains their trajectories in the spatiotemporal
plane. From these trajectories, DFOS provides mean velocities for real-time
spatially continuous traffic monitoring without dead zones. However, when
vehicle vibration intensities are insufficiently low due to slow speed,
trajectories cannot be obtained, leading to missing values in mean velocity
data. It restricts DFOS applicability in severe congestion. Therefore, this
paper proposes a missing value imputation method based on data assimilation.
Our proposed method is validated on two expressways in Japan with the reference
data. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the imputed mean
velocities to the reference increases only by 1.5 km/h as compared with the MAE
of non-missing values. This study enhances the wide-range applicability of DFOS
in practical cases.

Motivation: 几乎周期分段线性系统在过程调节中关键的干扰抑制问题尚缺少有效的保证方法，需要开发H∞性能分析和控制器综合方法。

Method: 基于APPLS系统特性开发H∞性能分析方法，并提出实用的H∞控制器综合算法，在卷对卷(R2R)干式转移制造系统中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的方法能够实现更保守和性能更优的H∞控制器，与不考虑系统切换结构的基准H∞控制器相比显著改善。

Conclusion: 本研究为APPLS系统提供了有效的H∞性能分析和控制器综合方法，在实际制造系统中证明了其优势，为进阶制造系统的干扰抑制提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: An almost periodic piecewise linear system (APPLS) is a type of piecewise
linear system where the system cyclically switches between different modes,
each with an uncertain but bounded dwell-time. Process regulation, especially
disturbance rejection, is critical to the performance of these advanced
systems. However, a method to guarantee disturbance rejection has not been
developed. The objective of this study is to develop an $H_\infty$ performance
analysis method for APPLSs, building on which an algorithm to synthesize
practical $H_\infty$ controllers is proposed. As an application, the developed
methods are demonstrated with an advanced manufacturing system -- roll-to-roll
(R2R) dry transfer of two-dimensional materials and printed flexible
electronics. Experimental results show that the proposed method enables a less
conservative and much better performing $H_\infty$ controller compared with a
baseline $H_\infty$ controller that does not account for the uncertain system
switching structure.

as well as their conflict-free fusion scheduling. Firstly, a high precision
deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV formation path-following model is
developed, and the reward function with adaptive weights is designed from the
perspective of distance and velocity errors. Then, we use integrated sensing
and communication (ISAC) signals to detect the obstacle and derive the
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for obstacle sensing by information-level fusion,
based on which we propose the variable formation enhanced obstacle position
estimation (VFEO) algorithm. In addition, an online obstacle avoidance scheme
without pretraining is designed to solve the sparse reward. Finally, with the
aid of null space based (NSB) behavioral method, we present a hierarchical
subtasks fusion strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of the subtask algorithms and the hierarchical fusion strategy.

*Poulomee Ghosh,Shubhendu Bhasin*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型参考自适应控制（MRAC）的优化自由方法，用于处理具有状态和输入约束的不确定线性时不变系统，在存在不匹配有界扰动的情况下保证约束满足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的约束控制方法如MPC和CBF需要每个时间步求解优化问题，计算负担重。本文旨在开发一种无需在线优化的自适应控制方法，同时处理状态和输入约束以及不匹配扰动。

Method: 结合饱和自适应控制器和基于障碍Lyapunov函数（BLF）的设计，确保系统状态和输入始终保持在预设边界内。该方法不需要在线求解优化问题。

Result: 提出了首个同时考虑状态和输入约束的不确定系统控制方法，并提供了充分可行性条件来检查可接受控制策略的存在性。仿真结果表明该方法有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为具有约束和扰动的不确定系统提供了一种计算效率高的自适应控制解决方案，避免了传统优化方法的计算负担。

Abstract: We propose a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) for uncertain linear
time-invariant (LTI) plants with user-defined state and input constraints in
the presence of unmatched bounded disturbances. Unlike popular
optimization-based approaches for constrained control, such as model predictive
control (MPC) and control barrier function (CBF) that solve a constrained
optimization problem at each step using the system model, our approach is
optimization-free and adaptive; it combines a saturated adaptive controller
with a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF)-based design to ensure that the plant
state and input always stay within pre-specified bounds despite the presence of
unmatched disturbances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result
that considers both state and input constraints for control of uncertain
systems with disturbances and provides sufficient feasibility conditions to
check for the existence of an admissible control policy. Simulation results,
including a comparison with a robust MRAC, demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自适应控制方法难以同时处理时变状态和输入约束，通常需要依赖在线优化，计算复杂度高且缺乏可行性验证。

Method: 采用时变障碍Lyapunov函数(TVBLF)强制状态约束，使用时变饱和函数处理输入限制，并推导出可验证的离线可行性条件。

Result: 仿真结果表明该约束MRAC方案有效，能够实现期望的瞬态和稳态性能。

Conclusion: 这是首个无需在线优化即可同时处理时变状态和输入约束的自适应控制方法，具有可验证的可行性条件和良好的控制性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) framework for
uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to user-defined,
time-varying state and input constraints. The proposed design seamlessly
integrates a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) to enforce state
constraints with a time-varying saturation function to handle input limits.
These time-varying constraints can be designed as performance functions to
shape transient and steady-state behaviors for both state and input. A key
contribution is the derivation of a verifiable, offline feasibility condition
to check the existence of a valid control policy for a given set of
constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adaptive control
methodology to simultaneously handle both time-varying state and input
constraints without resorting to online optimization. Simulation results
validate the efficacy of the proposed constrained MRAC scheme.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 基于改进电化学单粒模型的适应性死区双滑模观测器，实现了高精度、快速收敛的锂电池SOC估计，在动态条件和老化情况下都体现优秀性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电化学模型虽然能提供高保真度的SOC估计，但存在参数变化、非线性和计算复杂性等挑战，需要一种方法来解决这些问题以提高估计精度和计算效率。

Method: 提出一种基于改进电化学单粒模型的适应性死区双滑模观测器。算法集成了状态观测器用于SOC估计和参数观测器用于在线参数适应，并引入了基于Lyapunov的适应性死区来确保稳定性。

Result: 在稳态电流和UDDS动态条件下验证，适应性死区双滑模观测器较传统双滑模观测器和基于等效电路模型的EKF方法具有更高精度。SOC估计误差在正确初始化下保持在0.2%以内，在30%初始SOC误差下位于1%，且速度快速收敛。计算效率分析显示其通过限制不必要的参数更新减少了执行时间。

Conclusion: 该方法为SOC估计提供了一种可靠、准确且计算效率高的解决方案，适合实时电池管理应用。在电池老化情况下依然能维持稳定的SOC估计性能，显示了其强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is critical for ensuring the
safety, reliability, and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries in electric
vehicles and energy storage systems. Electrochemical models provide high
fidelity for SOC estimation but introduce challenges due to parameter
variations, nonlinearities, and computational complexity. To address these
issues, this paper proposes an adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode
observer(SMO) based on an improved electrochemical single-particle model. The
algorithm integrates a state observer for SOC estimation and a parameter
observer for online parameter adaptation. A Lyapunov-derived adaptive dead-zone
is introduced to ensure stability, activating parameter updates only when the
terminal voltage error lies within a rigorously defined bound. The proposed
method was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions.
Results demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior
accuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based
EKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct
initialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid
convergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive
dead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the
conventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting
its suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover,
robustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where
the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite
parameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a
reliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了多种持续学习(CL)和迁移学习(TL)策略，以及从头开始训练的模型，用于建筑热动力学模型的更新。研究提出了季节性记忆学习(SML)策略，在包含概念浪移的场景下显著提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前迁移学习是在有限数据下建模建筑热动力学的最有效方法，但随着时间推移收集到更多运营数据时，如何更新模型以提高预测准确性并应对建筑动态变化(如改造或占用情况变化)的挑战仍不明确。

Method: 研究比较了多种CL和TL策略以及从头训练的模型，使用5-7年的模拟数据(代表中欧单房家居民房)进行评估，包括包含改造和占用变化导致的概念浪移场景。研究提出了季节性记忆学习(SML)策略。

Result: SML策略在计算芯耗低的情况下，较现有CL和TL方法提供了更大的准确性提升。在无概念浪移的情况下超过初始精细调整基准28.1%，在有概念浪移的情况下超迈34.9%。

Conclusion: 季节性记忆学习(SML)是一种高效的持续学习策略，能够在建筑运营过程中持续改善热动力学模型的预测性能，特别是在遇到概念浪移时保持优异的表现。

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling
building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a
pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it
remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational
measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more
complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit
or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning
(CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can
also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step
and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to
incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and
address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building
thermal dynamics is still missing.
  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a
model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building
operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data
representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios
with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL
strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements
than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort.
SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept
drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构感知的维度缩减策略，为DC最优潮流问题中的机会约束优化提供了更高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Chance-constrained optimization has emerged as a promising framework for
managing uncertainties in power systems. This work advances its application to
the DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) model, developing a novel approach to
uncertainty modeling and estimation. Current methods typically tackle these
problems by first modeling random nodal injections using high-dimensional
statistical distributions that scale with the number of buses, followed by
deriving deterministic reformulations of the probabilistic constraints. We
propose an alternative methodology that exploits the constraint structure to
inform the uncertainties to be estimated, enabling significant dimensionality
reduction. Rather than learning joint distributions of net-load forecast errors
across units, we instead directly model the one-dimensional aggregate system
forecast error and two-dimensional line errors weighted by power transfer
distribution factors. We evaluate our approach under both Gaussian and
non-Gaussian distributions on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating
significant improvements in statistical accuracy and optimization performance
compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates a control approach that renders the driveshaft
inertia completely available on the grid side and enhances the fault
ride-through behavior of medium-voltage (MV) drive systems. Two main
contributions are presented. First, we show how the rotational inertia of the
driveline shaft can be synchronously coupled to the grid through a modification
of the speed control reference signal and through an adapted DC-link control
strategy. For the latter, we pursue two alternatives: one based on conventional
cascaded control and another based on synchronous machine (SM) model matching.
Second, we demonstrate that both the standard phase-locked loop (PLL) and the
matching control approach can be interpreted, via the ray-circle
complementarity, as feedback optimization schemes with distinct steady-state
maps. This perspective allows us to revisit matching control, reveal its
embedded PLL, highlight its current-limiting and tracking capabilities, and
provide an extensive simulation study.

TL;DR: DynaMark是一个基于强化学习的动态水印框架，通过马尔可夫决策过程自适应调整高斯水印协方差，有效防御工业4.0机床控制器的重放攻击，在保持控制性能的同时显著降低水印能量消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业4.0中高度网络化的机床控制器容易受到重放攻击，现有动态水印方案假设线性高斯动态并使用恒定统计量，无法适应机床控制器时变且部分专有的行为特性。

Method: 提出DynaMark强化学习框架，将动态水印建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在线学习自适应策略，动态调整零均值高斯水印的协方差，无需系统知识。开发贝叶斯置信更新机制实现实时检测置信度。

Result: 在西门子Sinumerik 828D控制器数字孪生上，相比恒定方差基线，水印能量降低70%同时保持标称轨迹，平均检测延迟相当于一个采样间隔。物理步进电机测试台验证了这些发现。

Conclusion: DynaMark框架有效解决了工业控制系统重放攻击检测问题，在保持控制性能的同时显著优化水印能量效率，超越了现有基准方法。

Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime
targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate
actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes
assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making
them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We
close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models
dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive
policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian
watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing
system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control
performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We
develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence
in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions,
underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D
controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by
70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance
baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one
sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,
rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding
existing benchmarks.

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

Conclusion: 提出的级联观测器架构能够有效实现单目视觉惯性里程计，在持续激励平移运动条件下实现稳定的速度和重力方向估计。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines
optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular
visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame
velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction
information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data.
This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer,
which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The
estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an
optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on
$\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer
architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract
the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent
algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit
sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through
simulation results.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons show promise to assist human movement, but their
utility is limited by controllers designed for discrete, predefined actions in
controlled environments, restricting their real-world applicability. We present
an uncertainty-aware control framework that enables ankle exoskeletons to
operate safely across diverse scenarios by automatically disengaging when
encountering unfamiliar movements. Our approach uses an uncertainty estimator
to classify movements as similar (in-distribution) or different
(out-of-distribution) relative to actions in the training set. We evaluated
three architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial
networks) on an offline dataset and tested the strongest performing
architecture (ensemble of gait phase estimators) online. The online test
demonstrated the ability of our uncertainty estimator to turn assistance on and
off as the user transitioned between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
tasks (F1: 89.2). This new framework provides a path for exoskeletons to safely
and autonomously support human movement in unstructured, everyday environments.

Motivation: 机器人学和导航中的许多估计问题涉及依赖于先前状态的测量（如里程计）。传统方法随机克隆需要状态向量增广来处理相关性，但存在计算和内存开销问题。

Method: 采用广义卡尔曼滤波器公式，推导出能够处理相关延迟状态测量的滤波器，无需状态增广即可捕获与先前状态估计的相关性。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波器变体本质上能够处理相关延迟状态测量，存在更高效的替代公式可以实现相同结果，澄清了常见的误解。

Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that
depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the
relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these
delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior
state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which
augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the
delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter
yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring
state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation
provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for
higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are
inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements,
demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more
efficiently.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action
masked Deep Q-Networks with safe ZYZ regrasp strategies to an underactuated
gripper-equipped 6-DOF collaborative robot for autonomous Soma cube assembly
learning. Our approach represents the first systematic integration of
constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning
on a Doosan M0609 collaborative robot. We address critical challenges in
robotic manipulation: combinatorial action space explosion, unsafe motion
planning, and systematic assembly strategy learning. Our system integrates a
legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes
Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing
computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining
solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages
ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with
manipulation constraints. Curriculum learning across three progressive
difficulty levels (2-piece, 3-piece, 7-piece) achieves remarkable training
efficiency: 100\% success rate for Level 1 within 500 episodes, 92.9\% for
Level 2, and 39.9\% for Level 3 over 105,300 total training episodes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构传感器（具有不同感知能力的机器人）在多目标跟踪中的分配挑战，优化跟踪质量并最小化目标状态估计的不确定性

Method: 将机器人分类为充分感知（具备距离和方位传感器）和有限感知（仅具备距离或方位传感器）两类，利用拟阵理论设计贪心分配算法，动态分配机器人到目标以最大化跟踪质量

Result: 算法保证任意跟踪质量函数的1/3常数因子近似比和子模函数的1/2近似比，多项式时间复杂度，仿真显示能准确长期跟踪目标，性能接近最优分配

Conclusion: 提出的贪心分配算法在异构传感器多目标跟踪中具有鲁棒性和实际应用价值，性能接近最优且计算效率高

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of assigning heterogeneous sensors (i.e.,
robots with varying sensing capabilities) for multi-target tracking. We
classify robots into two categories: (1) sufficient sensing robots, equipped
with range and bearing sensors, capable of independently tracking targets, and
(2) limited sensing robots, which are equipped with only range or bearing
sensors and need to at least form a pair to collaboratively track a target. Our
objective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target
state estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging
matroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically
allocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm
guarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking
quality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining
polynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended
periods. Furthermore, numerical results confirm that the algorithm's
performance is close to that of the optimal assignment, highlighting its
robustness and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的车辆协调框架，通过分布轨迹控制、并行优化算法和交互注意力机制，在动态不确定环境中同时保证安全性和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态不确定环境中协同车辆协调时安全保证和实时性能之间的根本矛盾，特别是在多车交互场景下。

Method: 1) 直接控制车辆轨迹分布的鲁棒协同规划方法；2) 基于ADMM的分布式轨迹协商算法；3) 选择性关注关键交互参与者的交互注意力机制。

Result: 在各种场景下碰撞率降低40.79%，计算需求减少14.1%，在真实动态障碍物环境中验证了鲁棒协调能力。

Conclusion: 该框架在安全性、实时性能和可扩展性方面显著优于现有方法，能够有效处理复杂环境中的车辆协调问题。

Abstract: Achieving both safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative
vehicle coordination remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in dynamic
and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel coordination framework
that resolves this challenge through three key innovations: 1) direct control
of vehicles' trajectory distributions during coordination, formulated as a
robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints,
ensuring a specified level of safety regarding the uncertainty of the
interactive trajectory, 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory
negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization
problem while allowing configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution
quality and computational resources, and 3) an interactive attention mechanism
that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to further
enhance computational efficiency. Both simulation results and practical
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant advantages in
safety (reducing collision rates by up to 40.79\% in various scenarios) and
real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
strong scalability with increasing vehicle numbers. The proposed interactive
attention mechanism further reduces the computational demand by 14.1\%. The
framework's effectiveness is further validated through real-world experiments
with unexpected dynamic obstacles, demonstrating robust coordination in complex
environments. The experiment demo could be found at

Motivation: 为了解决自动驾驶车辆在复杂场景中的运动规划和决策问题，避免次优解并确保车辆稳定性，需要开发能够探索多样化轨迹的多模态控制算法

Method: 使用多模态模型预测路径积分控制算法，采用Sobol序列在先前输入周围采样，结合碰撞避免的解析解，使用非线性单轨车辆模型和Fiala轮胎模型作为预测模型，并强制执行摩擦圆内的轮胎力约束

Result: 在高保真仿真环境中，该方法成功避免了障碍物，在高低摩擦路面的双车道变换机动和移动障碍物的遮挡场景中保持车辆稳定，性能优于标准模型预测路径积分方法

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态控制算法能够有效处理自动驾驶车辆的复杂运动规划任务，通过探索多样化轨迹和确保车辆稳定性，在多种挑战性场景中表现出优越性能

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making
for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral
control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior
input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By
leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse
trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before
them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track
vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force
constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability
during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal
acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to
control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the
vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and
low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles,
outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人额定负载基于最坏情况配置，导致整个工作空间内负载能力被严重低估，无法充分利用机器人固有能力。

Method: 使用去噪扩散模型生成轨迹，将负载约束显式纳入规划过程，能够在恒定时间内生成可直接执行的动态可行关节空间轨迹。

Result: 在7自由度Franka Emika Panda机器人上的实验验证显示，即使负载超过额定容量3倍，仍有67.6%的工作空间可访问。

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展了机器人的操作范围，强调了在运动规划算法中更细致考虑负载动力学的重要性。

Abstract: Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from
worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the
entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's
inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely
handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their
workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque
limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a
novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that
explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike
traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error,
optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners
that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically
feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly
executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation
on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the
workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal
capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a
more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboInspector是一个分析LLM在机器人操作中策略代码生成不可靠性的框架，通过任务复杂性和指令粒度两个维度识别不可靠行为，并提出基于失败反馈的优化方法，将可靠性提升35%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在机器人操作中表现出强大的代码生成能力，但由于真实世界任务的多样性和用户指令的复杂性，策略代码生成的可靠性仍然是一个重大挑战。不同用户对同一任务可能给出不同的指令，这会导致策略代码生成的不稳定性。

Method: 设计了RoboInspector流水线，从操作任务复杂性和指令粒度两个角度分析和表征策略代码的不可靠性。在两大主流框架中进行了168种任务-指令-LLM组合的综合实验，识别出四种主要不可靠行为。并引入了基于失败策略代码反馈的优化方法。

Result: 识别出导致操作失败的四种主要不可靠行为，并详细表征了这些行为及其根本原因。通过基于反馈的优化方法，在仿真和真实环境中将策略代码生成的可靠性提升了高达35%。

Conclusion: RoboInspector为理解LLM在机器人操作中的不可靠性提供了系统分析框架，所提出的优化方法显著提高了策略代码生成的可靠性，为实际应用开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

Result: 提供了评估方法学和评价指标，能够有效识别人类合作性，并展示了如何通过几何推理实现适时沟通。

Conclusion: 通过几何分析和适时沟通可以有效解决社交导航中的人类行为不可预测问题，提升人机交互的协调性。

Abstract: Socially aware robot navigation is a planning paradigm where the robot
navigates in human environments and tries to adhere to social constraints while
interacting with the humans in the scene. These navigation strategies were
further improved using human prediction models, where the robot takes the
potential future trajectory of humans while computing its own. Though these
strategies significantly improve the robot's behavior, it faces difficulties
from time to time when the human behaves in an unexpected manner. This happens
as the robot fails to understand human intentions and cooperativeness, and the
human does not have a clear idea of what the robot is planning to do. In this
paper, we aim to address this gap through effective communication at an
appropriate time based on a geometric analysis of the context and human
cooperativeness in head-on crossing scenarios. We provide an assessment
methodology and propose some evaluation metrics that could distinguish a
cooperative human from a non-cooperative one. Further, we also show how
geometric reasoning can be used to generate appropriate verbal responses or
robot actions.

Abstract: Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors
with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on
short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve
long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution
shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns
continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill
demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph,
discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains
low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level
oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal
observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables
capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal
relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to
discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six
domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers
of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two
environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five
skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and
interpretable decision making.

Conclusion: MIT*通过创新的信息集构建、自适应采样和碰撞检测策略，显著提高了路径规划的成本效率和计算时间，同时在受限场景中保持高成功率

Abstract: Path planning in robotics often involves solving continuously valued,
high-dimensional problems. Popular informed approaches include graph-based
searches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which
utilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization
incrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets
of the problem domain based on the current best solution cost. However, when no
solution is found, these planners re-sample and explore the entire
configuration space, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive.
This article introduces Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*), a novel planner that
constructs estimated informed sets based on prior admissible solution costs
before finding the initial solution, thereby accelerating the initial
convergence rate. Moreover, MIT* employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically
adjusts the sampling strategy based on the exploration process. Furthermore,
MIT* utilizes length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy
reverse search. These features enhance path cost efficiency and computation
times while ensuring high success rates in confined scenarios. Through a series
of simulations and real-world experiments, it is confirmed that MIT*
outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4
to R^16 and has been successfully applied to real-world robot manipulation
tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

Abstract: Traversing narrow gates presents a significant challenge and has become a
standard benchmark for evaluating agile and precise quadrotor flight.
Traditional modularized autonomous flight stacks require extensive design and
parameter tuning, while end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) methods often
suffer from low sample efficiency and limited interpretability. In this work,
we present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive
control (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN)
trained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function
weights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current
drone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy
gradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate
traversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the
attitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating
effective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate
that our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow
gates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude
improvement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches.

Abstract: Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments,
making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of
model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in
practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances.
There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be
executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive
control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a
robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free
motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making
our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a
simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered
environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark
methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model
uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.

Conclusion: 这种方法显示出良好的前景，证明了强化学习可以有效地利用CEI模型来学习安全的人机交互策略，值得进一步探索和研究。

Abstract: Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an
awkward interaction known as the "sidewalk salsa": they both (repeatedly)
deviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use
case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in
the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation
based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how
pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into
the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and
acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,
a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction
(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,
it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and
decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used
framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept
for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model
to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL
agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a
risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model
learned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and
thereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the
modelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and
encourage further exploration.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多粒度EEG情绪分类框架，使用LSTM-GRU模型在GAMEEMO数据集上实现了优异的情绪识别性能，在二分类、多分类和多标签任务中均取得最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG情绪识别研究多集中于二分类或特定被试分类，限制了在真实情感计算系统中的泛化能力和部署应用。

Method: 采用结构化预处理策略（时间窗分割、混合统计和频域特征提取、z-score标准化），构建多粒度情绪标签（二分类价态、多分类情感状态、多标签细粒度表示），并评估多种机器学习模型。

Result: LSTM-GRU模型表现最佳，在二分类价态任务中F1-score达0.932，在多分类和多标签情绪分类中分别达到94.5%和90.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该统一框架为EEG情绪识别提供了有效的多粒度解决方案，LSTM-GRU架构在处理时序EEG信号方面展现出优越性能，有助于推动情感计算系统的实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无评论家强化学习方法（特别是组策略）严重依赖策略内的多重采样和比较来估计优势值，这容易导致策略陷入局部最优并增加计算成本

Method: 使用参考模型提前进行rollout计算奖励分数作为参考锚点，通过数据预采样评估样本难度并选择高增益数据，有效纠正组内比较带来的累积偏差

Conclusion: PVPO通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样机制，显著减少了rollout依赖并提高了训练效率，为无评论家强化学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

TL;DR: AdaGram是一种高效的全矩阵自适应梯度优化器，通过快速对称分解和低秩近似来降低计算和内存开销，在标准机器学习任务上实现了比对角自适应优化器更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应梯度方法（如Adagrad）使用对角预处理矩阵，无法捕捉参数相关性。全矩阵自适应方法虽然能建模这些相关性，但计算和内存成本过高，限制了在大规模模型中的应用。

Method: 提出AdaGram优化器，采用快速对称分解计算预处理更新方向，并使用矩阵积分器方法保持预处理器的低秩结构，从而降低内存和计算开销。

Result: 在标准机器学习任务上的数值实验表明，AdaGram在使用秩五及更低秩近似时，收敛速度比对角自适应优化器更快或相当。

Conclusion: AdaGram作为一种可扩展的自适应优化解决方案，在大模型中具有应用潜力，能够在保持效率的同时实现更好的收敛性能。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

TL;DR: 本文提出PILOT框架，将LLM路由问题建模为上下文多臂老虎机问题，通过共享嵌入空间和在线学习实现自适应模型选择，同时考虑用户预算约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法假设已知最优查询-模型配对，但实际应用中缺乏完整映射且查询动态变化，需要自适应决策方法。

Method: 构建查询和LLM的共享嵌入空间，基于离线人类偏好数据初始化，通过LinUCB扩展算法在线优化，并引入多选择背包问题处理成本约束。

Result: 提出了PILOT框架，能够在不需要对所有LLM进行完整推理的情况下，通过bandit反馈实现自适应路由决策。

Conclusion: 将LLM路由建模为上下文bandit问题，结合离线偏好和在线学习，有效解决了实际应用中的动态查询和成本约束挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Motivation: 现有的合成数据隐私审计框架依赖经验法则和不合理假设，在描述和检测通过合成数据发布造成的训练数据隐私泄漏方面能力有限。表格生成模型往往会在训练分布的某些区域显著过拟合，这为成员推断攻击提供了新的攻击角度。

Method: 提出Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA)方法，这是一种计算高效的"无盒"成员推断攻击。方法不需要模型知识或访问权限，通过评估测试观测对假模型局部概率比估计的影响来形成攻击。

Result: 在涉及多种数据集、模型架构和攻击参数的全面性基准测试中，Gen-LRA在多个性能指标上一贵领先于其他生成模型的成员推断攻击方法。

Conclusion: Gen-LRA作为一种有效的隐私审计工具，显著提高了对合成数据发布隐私风险的识别能力，强调了生成模型过拟合在实际应用中带来的重大隐私风险。

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 深度残差回声状态网络通过层次化残差结构有效提升了长期时序建模能力，为未训练循环网络提供了新的架构设计思路

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

Conclusion: 为解码过程提供了统一的变分视角，揭示了温度、采样技术等实践参数的理论本质，并为路径依赖的分数调整和幻觉行为提供了受控分析框架

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现LLM强化学习中出现了一系列反直觉现象，但这些现象的有效条件和失败场景尚不明确，需要系统研究来理解这些现象背后的机制。

Method: 通过系统全面的实验验证，在不同模型架构和任务领域中检验一系列反直觉主张，重点关注预训练模型与任务的对齐程度（以pass@k准确率衡量）。

Result: 研究发现标准RL训练在各种设置下都保持稳健，而许多反直觉结果只在模型与任务已经表现出强对齐时才出现。在更具挑战性的情况下，这些技术无法驱动实质性学习。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐程度是区分RL观察结果的关键因素，标准RL方法在困难场景中仍然有效，而反直觉技术仅在对齐良好时适用。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Result: 在具有挑战性的模拟环境中评估，算法优于传统RL方法

Conclusion: 该算法能够同时从整体平均和时间平均中受益，有效提升个体轨迹的长期性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

*Mohammad Amin Nabian,Sanjay Choudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于混合专家(MoE)的元学习框架，动态整合三种先进CFD代理模型的预测，在汽车空气动力学预测中显著降低误差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真CFD仿真计算成本高，现有ML代理模型架构多样但无单一最优方案，需要利用架构多样性提升预测性能

Method: 使用门控网络动态组合DoMINO、X-MeshGraphNet和FigConvNet三种异构专家模型，通过熵正则化防止模型坍塌，在DrivAerML数据集上训练验证

Result: MoE模型在所有评估物理量上均显著降低L-2预测误差，优于集成平均和最准确的单个专家模型

Conclusion: MoE框架通过协同整合专业架构的互补优势，为创建更鲁棒准确的复合代理模型提供了有效策略

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) 是一种新的机制可解释性方法，使用层间相关性传播(LRP)系数替代梯度，在保持计算效率的同时比标准归因修补更准确地近似激活修补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活修补是机制可解释性中定位模型组件的重要方法，但计算成本高；归因修补虽然更快但存在噪声和可靠性问题，特别是在深度非线性网络中。

Method: 提出Relevance Patching (RelP)，用LRP的传播系数替代归因修补中的局部梯度，仅需两次前向传播和一次反向传播，保持计算效率的同时提高忠实度。

Result: 在多个模型和任务上验证，RelP比标准归因修补更准确地近似激活修补，在GPT-2 Large的IOI任务中，MLP输出的Pearson相关性从0.006提升到0.956。

Conclusion: RelP在计算效率和准确性方面都优于现有方法，为大规模机制可解释性分析提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

TL;DR: FedOwen是一个高效的联邦学习框架，使用Owen采样来近似Shapley值，在相同评估预算下比现有方法误差更小，并通过自适应客户端选择策略实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中准确估计客户端贡献对于公平奖励和选择有用客户端至关重要，但精确计算Shapley值在客户端数量大时计算复杂度指数增长，不可行。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，使用Owen采样近似Shapley值，采用自适应客户端选择策略平衡利用高价值客户端和探索未充分采样的客户端。

Result: 在相同评估成本下，FedOwen在非IID基准测试中比最先进基线方法获得高达23%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: FedOwen通过高效的Shapley值近似和智能客户端选择，显著提高了联邦学习的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

### [123] [Guess-and-Learn (G&L): Measuring the Cumulative Error Cost of Cold-Start Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21270)
*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G&L v1.0提出了一个评估机器学习模型冷启动适应性的框架，通过测量模型在顺序标注未标记数据集时累积的错误来评估适应成本，而不仅仅是最终准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器学习评估过于关注最终准确率，忽视了模型从零开始学习过程中的适应成本（累积错误）。G&L旨在填补这一空白，量化模型在早期学习阶段的错误成本。

Method: 设计了四个实验轨道（Scratch/Pretrained × Online/Batch），通过让学习器顺序选择实例、预测标签、接收真实标签并更新参数的方式，测量错误轨迹。在MNIST和AG News数据集上测试了多种模型。

Result: 发现小模型在早期阶段能以更少的初始错误适应，预训练效果因领域而异。所有当前模型的表现都远高于oracle参考带，显示出明显的适应性差距。

Conclusion: G&L提供了一个可重复的框架来评估模型从第一个样本开始的可靠性，补充了传统基准测试，有助于开发不仅极限准确而且从一开始就可靠的学习器。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

TL;DR: CALM是一个用于非平稳时间序列流实时异常检测的端到端框架，通过持续微调和LLM辅助判断来应对概念漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练的异常检测模型在面对数据统计特性随时间变化的概念漂移时性能显著下降，需要能够实时适应数据变化的解决方案

Method: 基于Apache Beam分布式处理框架，使用TimesFm基础模型进行预测式异常检测，采用闭环持续微调机制和LLM-as-a-Judge组件进行语义判断

Result: 在TSB-UAD基准测试中，持续微调模型相比静态预训练基础模型在大多数数据集上提高了ROC AUC分数

Conclusion: CALM框架通过自适应和LLM引导的方法，在动态流环境中有效维持高性能异常检测

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌电信号固有的非平稳性使得域偏移检测具有挑战性，需要开发有效的实时检测方法来维持稳定的肌电解码模型。

Method: 使用KPCA（余弦核）预处理DB6数据集，定义基于不同受试者和记录会话的域，评估CUSUM、Page-Hinckley和ADWIN等漂移检测方法。

Result: 当前技术在肌电信号实时域偏移检测中表现不佳，性能有限，无法达到高准确度。

Conclusion: 流式处理方法在维持稳定肌电解码模型方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究提升鲁棒性和真实场景下的准确性。

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyGO是一个受生物睡眠周期启发的终身学习框架，通过生成模型存储任务分布而非原始数据，在睡眠阶段使用生成数据巩固知识，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有持续学习方法面临的数据隐私、存储限制和任务差异导致的性能下降问题，避免存储原始数据的需求。

Method: 采用"唤醒-睡眠"双阶段：唤醒阶段快速学习新任务并训练紧凑生成模型；睡眠阶段使用所有生成模型生成伪数据，通过知识蒸馏将新旧知识整合到核心特征提取器中。

Result: 在计算机视觉(Split-MNIST)和自然语言处理(Split-AG News)基准测试中显著缓解灾难性遗忘，保持跨任务的高平均准确率。

Conclusion: MyGO框架有效解决了持续学习中的关键挑战，具有隐私保护、存储高效和领域通用性等优势。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

TL;DR: VILA是一个新的机器学习遗忘框架，通过改进FILA方法中Fisher信息的假设处理，提高了敏感参数识别的准确性，同时大幅降低计算成本，实现了100倍的参数效率和40倍的训练速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理敏感信息时存在泄露风险，传统重训练方法计算成本过高，而现有的FILA方法虽然参数高效但仍需访问全部参数且Fisher信息估计不准确。

Method: 提出VILA框架，显式考虑FILA忽略的Fisher信息基本假设，提高遗忘集参数识别准确性；通过避免访问整个模型参数来显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE基准测试中达到最先进性能，相比FILA实现100倍参数效率和40倍训练速度提升。

Conclusion: VILA通过改进参数重要性估计和降低计算需求，为机器遗忘提供了一种更高效准确的解决方案，在保护敏感信息的同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kyj93790/VILA.

*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析Q-learning算法收敛性的理论框架，针对使用代理状态（如RNN状态）而非信念状态，并采用策略正则化的Q-learning变体，证明了其在温和技术条件下的收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Q-learning理论分析通常假设使用信念状态或信息状态，而实践中常用的算法往往使用代理状态（如RNN隐藏状态）并采用策略正则化来促进探索和稳定性，这需要新的理论框架来理解其收敛行为。

Method: 提出了正则化代理状态Q-learning（RASQL）框架，分析了使用代理状态和策略正则化的Q-learning算法，建立了收敛性理论并扩展到周期性策略变体，通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 证明了RASQL在温和技术条件下收敛到适当定义的正则化MDP的固定点，该固定点取决于行为策略诱导的平稳分布，数值实验显示经验收敛行为与理论极限一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解实践中常用的Q-learning算法的收敛性提供了理论基础，特别是针对使用代理状态和策略正则化的算法变体，填补了理论分析与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE是一种改进的稀疏自编码器方法，通过采样策略在批次级别和令牌级别特征选择之间提供可调节的平衡，解决了BatchTopK的激活彩票问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TopK SAE对每个令牌使用固定的K个最活跃特征，效率低下。BatchTopK虽然提高了平均重建效果，但存在"激活彩票"问题，即罕见的高幅值特征会挤掉信息丰富但幅值较低的特征。

Method: 提出Sampled-SAE方法：通过L2范数或熵对批次激活矩阵的列（特征）进行评分，形成大小为Kl的候选池，然后在受限的特征池中对批次中的令牌应用Top-K选择。参数l控制选择范围，l=1时仅从K个全局重要特征中选择，l增大时接近标准BatchTopK。

Result: 在Pythia-160M模型上的实验表明，没有单一的l值能在所有指标上达到最优，最佳选择取决于共享结构、重建保真度和下游性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE将BatchTopK重新构建为一个可调节的、分布感知的方法家族，提供了在全局一致性和细粒度重建之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时序数据具有复杂的长期时间依赖性和随时间变化的数据分布漂移，同时包含复杂的特征序列间相互关系，传统生成模型难以有效平衡这些挑战。

Method: 采用分阶段序列生成和阶段间信息传递来保持长期序列依赖并建模数据分布漂移；在每个阶段内使用渐进序列分解进行通道独立建模，阶段间使用多通道融合建模。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验验证了Stage-Diff在长时序生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff通过结合通道独立建模的鲁棒性和多通道建模的信息融合优势，成功解决了长时序生成中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Motivation: 现有时间序列合成方法基于随机序列进行时间建模，难以确保生成时间序列的时间依赖性，且直接对随机序列建模难以准确捕捉原始时间序列特征信息。

Method: DLGAN将时间序列生成分解为序列特征提取和序列重建两阶段：首先构建完整的时间序列自编码器进行监督学习，确保重建过程能恢复序列时间依赖性；其次使用GAN生成与真实序列特征向量对齐的合成特征向量。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型在各种评估指标上均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: DLGAN是一个简单但有效的生成模型，通过双阶段分解方法成功解决了时间序列合成中的时间依赖性和特征准确性问题。

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Motivation: 探究神经网络是通过平滑渐进还是复杂计算过程来构建表示，特别是在棋类AI中的表现

Method: 通过扩展logit lens分析Leela Chess Zero策略网络，研究各层的棋力表现和解题能力

Result: 发现棋力和解题能力呈现强单调趋势，但策略分布经常遵循非平滑轨迹，与语言模型中观察到的平滑分布收敛形成对比

Conclusion: 神经网络表示构建过程可能比预想的更复杂，涉及早期发现但随后放弃正确解等非平滑计算过程

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 该方法可作为概念验证，有望发展为近实时监控工具，用于识别移动通信网络和交通网络的潜在弱点

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Motivation: 随着任务特定模型变体的激增，如何在不重新训练的情况下将这些专门化模块合并为统一模型成为关键挑战。现有合并技术往往独立处理每层，忽略了深度网络固有的层间依赖关系，导致分布不匹配问题。

Method: 提出Chain of Merges (CoM)方法，这是一种层间合并过程，以自回归方式更新激活统计量，显式地考虑跨层交互作用。通过一系列条件最优更新来生成连贯的合并模型。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoM实现了最先进的性能表现，有效缓解了由协变量偏移引起的性能退化。

Conclusion: CoM方法通过考虑层间依赖关系和解决内部协变量偏移问题，为预训练模型的合并提供了一种有效的解决方案，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 连续生物制造过程需要早期异常检测，因为即使微小偏差也会影响产量和稳定性，导致生产中断和经济损失。这些过程具有复杂非线性动态和变量间复杂关系，需要先进的异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 混合量子/经典方法在解决复杂连续生物制造过程中的实际问题方面具有巨大潜力，为工业应用提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

Motivation: 随着图数据规模扩大，双曲空间等黎曼流形数据空间受到关注，但传统NML方法主要针对欧几里得空间且依赖坐标系选择，难以扩展到黎曼流形。

Method: 定义了坐标变换不变的Rm-NML，扩展了现有NML计算技术到黎曼流形，并在黎曼对称空间上推导了计算简化方法，以双曲空间上的正态分布为例进行了具体计算。

Result: 成功构建了黎曼流形上的NML框架，该方法在欧几里得空间自然参数化下与传统NML一致，并实现了坐标变换不变性。

Conclusion: Rm-NML为黎曼流形数据空间的模型选择和遗憾最小化提供了理论基础和计算方法，特别适用于具有层次结构的图数据分析。

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

Result: 实验证明错误校准的网络可能优于校准网络，失败预测能更好地反映样本排序变化并与效率改进强相关

Conclusion: 失败预测比传统校准方法更适合作为早期退出模型设计和评估的基础，能更可靠地指导模型优化

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Conclusion: 需要有效的表格数据表示方法和公平性感知模型来提高LLM在金融决策中的可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Conclusion: 研究结果为现有求解器设计原则提供了理论解释，并指出了未来工作的有前景方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Conclusion: 虽然确立了技术可行性，但数据最小化在实践中仍然具有挑战性，其对技术和用户环境的依赖性使得难以实施通用的数据'必要性'标准。

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15

distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

Motivation: 海洋盐度对环流、气候和海洋生态系统至关重要，但现有测量方法存在稀疏、不规则和噪声问题，传统线性方法和机器学习模型在严重稀疏条件下效果有限。

Method: 提出了OceAn Salinity Imputation System (OASIS)，一种新颖的扩散对抗框架，能够更好地处理稀疏数据并整合物理协变量。

Conclusion: OASIS框架为海洋盐度数据填补提供了新的解决方案，有望改善海洋盐度测量的准确性和完整性。

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote
sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are
limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

Method: 分析过参数化两层PINNs在一般激活函数类别下的随机梯度下降/流训练过程，关键是通过确保Gram矩阵的正定性来处理随机优化引入的动态随机性

Result: 建立了随机梯度下降/流在高概率意义下的线性收敛性，扩展了现有仅分析梯度下降的结果

Conclusion: 该分析揭示了优化过程的动态特性，为通过随机算法训练的神经网络提供了收敛性保证，解决了随机优化方法在PINNs中的理论挑战

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

TL;DR: 基于情感和时间特征的机器学习模型预测社交媒体参与度，点赞预测效果极佳(R²=0.98)，但评论预测较差(R²=0.41)，表明评论受更多未捕获因素影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用情感和时间特征来预测社交媒体上的参与度（点赞和评论），探索情感元数据对用户参与行为的影响。

Method: 使用包含600首歌曲的情感标注数据集（效价、唤醒度等），采用HistGradientBoostingRegressor多目标回归模型，对经过对数变换的参与度比率进行训练。

Result: 模型在点赞预测上表现优异(R²=0.98)，但在评论预测上效果较差(R²=0.41)，表明情感和时间特征结合现有观看次数能有效预测未来参与度。

Conclusion: 点赞主要受情感和曝光信号驱动，而评论则依赖于当前特征集中未包含的额外因素，需要进一步研究评论预测的改进方法。

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)样本，现有方法在处理不同分布偏移程度时存在局限性

Method: 使用SVD分解分类头权重矩阵，将模型激活分解为决定性成分（对分类输出贡献最大）和不显著成分（贡献最小）。远OOD时利用不显著成分，近OOD时利用决定性成分，结合两者构建ActSub方法

Result: 在各种标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 通过分析分类头权重的奇异值分解，可以更有效地识别不同分布偏移程度的OOD样本，ActSub方法在远OOD和近OOD场景下都表现出色

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Motivation: 估计地方事件对社区心理健康的影响对公共卫生政策至关重要，传统预测方法无法充分捕捉事件对社区福祉的因果影响

Method: 将LRDD从计量经济学扩展到统计学习框架，整合历史评分、动态协变量和外生变量来预测未来的断点（时间特定变化）和斜率（线性轨迹）变化

Result: 预测任务具有挑战性但随着模型复杂度增加而变得可行，最佳结果来自整合外生和动态协变量（断点预测r=+0.46，斜率预测r=+0.65）

Conclusion: 断点预测为估计未来或假设事件对特定社区的异质性影响提供了新的可能性，相比传统静态社区表示方法有显著改进

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LCLS-II自由电子激光器产生高达1MHz的X射线脉冲，探测器数据吞吐量超过1TB/s，传统数据传输和存储成本过高，需要实时机器学习数据压缩方案，但常规实现延迟过高无法满足高速实验需求。

Method: 开发SLAC神经网络库(SNL)框架，支持在FPGA上部署实时ML推理模型，并能动态更新模型权重而无需FPGA重新综合。还开发了Auto-SNL Python扩展，可将Python神经网络模型自动转换为SNL兼容的高级综合代码。

Result: 与当前最先进工具hls4ml的基准测试比较显示，SNL在大多数测试的神经网络架构中实现了竞争性或更优的延迟性能，在某些情况下还节省了FPGA资源。

Conclusion: SNL展示了其多功能性，为高能物理、医学成像、机器人等领域的研究人员和学者开辟了新的机会，解决了高速实验环境中的实时数据处理挑战。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

Motivation: 现有的多标签排序框架只利用标签二分为正负集合的信息，没有充分利用正标签之间的排序信息，无法捕捉类别相关性的差异。

Method: 提出UniMLR方法，通过正标签的排序来建模隐式类别相关性概率分布；引入8个合成数据集(Ranked MNISTs)来解决数据稀缺和标注偏差问题。

Result: 统计证明该方法能准确学习正标签排序表示，与真实排序一致且与底层显著性值成比例；在真实和合成数据集上的实验验证了框架价值。

Conclusion: UniMLR通过利用正标签排序信息，为多标签排序提供了新的有效范式，能够更好地建模类别相关性并统一排序分类任务。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效处理心率预测中的数据异质性问题，学习到的表示在下游应用中具有实用价值

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

Motivation: 现实医疗环境中，患者的多模态数据（如电子健康记录、临床笔记、医学影像）往往存在差异或不完整，现有方法需要完整模态数据或依赖手动选择策略，限制了在真实临床环境中的应用。

Method: 提出MoE-Health框架，采用专门的专家网络和动态门控机制，根据可用数据模态动态选择和组合相关专家，实现灵活适应不同数据可用性场景。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的三个关键临床预测任务（院内死亡率预测、长期住院预测、再入院预测）中，MoE-Health相比现有多模态融合方法表现出更优性能，并在不同模态可用性模式下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合多模态信息，在处理异构和不完整医疗数据方面提供改进的预测性能和鲁棒性，特别适合部署在数据可用性异质的多样化医疗环境中。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

TL;DR: QR-LoRA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过QR分解提取预训练权重的正交基，仅训练标量系数，大幅减少可训练参数数量，在GLUE任务上性能优于全微调和标准LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型规模增长需要参数高效微调技术。标准LoRA直接学习更新矩阵，而SVD变体初始化成本高且奇异向量难以解释。

Method: 使用QR分解与列主元从预训练权重矩阵提取正交基，将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数。

Result: 在GLUE任务上，QR-LoRA性能匹配或超过全微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA，仅需601个参数（比全微调减少1000倍，比典型LoRA减少77倍）。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA通过正交基表达和系数训练，实现了极致的参数效率，同时保持了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

Motivation: 随着GDPR、HIPAA等隐私法规和AI责任框架的实施，真实数据的使用面临更多限制。合成数据生成成为解决方案，但需要同时满足隐私保护和公平性要求，特别是在医疗等敏感领域的表格数据应用中。

Method: 使用transformer-based VAE和潜在扩散模型生成异构表格数据。隐私保护：训练时采用Rényi差分隐私约束；公平性：输入空间使用RDP兼容的平衡采样，潜在空间使用CKA对齐不同保护组的神经元激活模式以实现统计独立性。

Conclusion: FLIP提供了一个有效的框架，在隐私保护的前提下生成公平的合成表格数据，具有广泛的应用前景，特别是在需要同时满足隐私和公平性要求的敏感数据场景中。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

### [162] [Fuzzy, Symbolic, and Contextual: Enhancing LLM Instruction via Cognitive Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21204)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了架构归纳偏置如何影响大语言模型在教学对话中的认知行为，通过引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式来促进结构化推理，实验表明完整系统优于基线变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型架构中的归纳偏置如何影响其在教学对话中的认知行为，特别是如何通过架构设计来促进自适应、结构化的苏格拉底式辅导推理。

Method: 引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的受控消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，并采用基于LLM的评估框架进行可扩展的系统比较。

Result: 完整系统在所有评估维度上一致优于基线变体，移除记忆或符号结构会显著降低关键认知行为（抽象、自适应探测和概念连续性）的表现。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明架构设计对模型认知行为具有重要影响。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

TL;DR: 使用多治理系统模拟临床诊断团队，通过层次辨论提高SOAP备忘录中疾病识别的准确性和稳健性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本的准确解释对患者护理至关重要，但单一模型缺乏高风险临床任务所需的稳健性

Method: 设计协作式多治理系统，由管理治理组织动态指派专家治理进行层次迭代辨论，分析SOAP备忘录中的S和O部分来识别临床问题

Result: 在420份MIMIC-III备忘录上评估，动态多治理配置在识别心力衰竭、急性肾伤伤和感染性伤病方面显示出持续改善的性能

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为开发更准确、稳健和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Method: 构建50篇论文和70个专家问题的阿尔茨海默病数据库，建立GraphRAG知识库，使用GPT-4o作为LLM，比较GraphRAG与标准GPT-4o的响应质量

Result: 论文评估了两种流行GraphRAG系统的质量和可追溯性，并提供了易于使用的界面供研究人员测试标准RAG和GraphRAG性能

Conclusion: GraphRAG在需要密集知识的生物医学领域具有应用潜力，研究为阿尔茨海默病研究提供了实用的评估工具和数据库

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单一本体系统或多个孤立本体系统的知识整合，缺乏跨本体连接的统一学习结构，导致概念表示学习局限于本体内部关系。

Method: 1) 使用LLM提供图检索增强的初始化嵌入；2) 通过双轴知识传播联合学习：垂直传播（本体内部层次）和水平传播（跨本体同层次）；3) 作为插件编码器与现有EHR预测模型兼容。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验验证了LINKO优于最先进基线方法的性能，在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO框架成功整合了多个医学本体系统的知识，通过跨本体连接增强了医学概念表示学习，为EHR预测模型提供了有效的插件式解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理任务表现出色但在简单交互任务中表现不佳的问题，弥合陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的差距。

Method: 将基于强化学习的决策制定重新表述为语言建模任务：LLMs生成语言指导的策略，通过基于环境反馈的在线强化学习进行迭代优化。

Result: TiG成功弥合了陈述性和程序性知识之间的差距，以显著更低的数据和计算需求实现了与传统RL方法相竞争的性能，并提供逐步的自然语言解释。

Conclusion: TiG框架有效解决了LLMs在交互环境中的决策制定问题，在保持透明度和可解释性的同时，大幅降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM是一个新的音频-语言模型基准测试，集成了10个评估维度，包括音频感知、知识、推理、情感检测、偏见、公平性、多语言性、鲁棒性、毒性和安全性，并提供了标准化的提示和评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测试一两个能力，且忽略了公平性和安全性等重要方面，不同评估之间难以进行模型比较。

Method: 开发了AHELM基准测试，整合了多个数据集（包括两个新的合成音频-文本数据集PARADE和CoRe-Bench），标准化了提示、推理参数和评估指标，测试了14个开放权重和闭源API模型以及3个基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个维度中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性（p=0.01）。基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具有语音转文本功能的系统总体排名第五。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了一个全面的音频-语言模型评估框架，揭示了当前模型的优势和局限性，特别是公平性问题，并展示了简单基线系统的竞争力。该基准将持续更新以纳入新数据集和模型。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Motivation: 现有遗忘操作主要基于经典逻辑（变量消除和AGM收缩），但缺乏对认知状态的深入分析。本文旨在从认知角度研究遗忘操作，探索在更丰富语义结构中的遗忘含义。

Method: 采用认知状态视角，提出五种通用认知遗忘类型，并在Spohn排序函数中实例化七种具体操作。借鉴逻辑编程和AGM理论的公理，建立评估遗忘操作的公理体系。

Conclusion: 本文为认知状态中的遗忘操作提供了系统的理论框架，将传统遗忘操作提升到认知层面，为知识管理中的选择性遗忘提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从状态-动作轨迹中学习STRIPS+模型的新方法SYNTH，用于解决滑动拼图等领域的模型学习问题，其中状态和动作信息都不完整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型学习方法大多假设动作是完整的STRIPS动作或所有谓词都可观察，但实际应用中状态信息往往不完整（如缺少空白位置谓词），动作参数也不完整。需要更现实的学习设置。

Method: 引入STRIPS+变体，允许动作参数在前提条件中隐式存在并支持有限形式的存在量化。SYNTH算法为每个动作构建分层序列的前提条件表达式（查询），用于识别状态中的唯一对象并接地隐式参数。

Result: 建立了SYNTH算法的正确性和完备性，并在从现有STRIPS领域衍生的STRIPS+模型生成的状态-动作轨迹上测试了其可扩展性。

Conclusion: SYNTH算法能够有效处理状态和动作信息不完整的现实学习场景，为从部分观察数据中学习动作模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个新的多模态搜索基准测试，包含311个需要深度视觉推理的任务，旨在解决现有基准测试中浅层工作流的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态浏览基准测试可以通过浅层、固定的工作流程解决，依赖于高召回图像搜索和附近文本，掩盖了真正的多模态挑战，如细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用。

Method: 采用空间-时间外推方法构建问题，要求从空间线索（微文本、部件外观、布局、标志）和时间痕迹（广播叠加、季节上下文）外推到图像外的事实。提供了一个模型无关的代理框架，包含浏览工具。

Result: 最强代理（o3）在没有搜索的情况下达到15.1%准确率，在框架下通过搜索达到36.0%。最强的开源模型（Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct）在没有搜索时为0.0%，经过20轮搜索后达到6.9%。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了当前MLLM在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面的失败，为多模态网络代理的发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智慧测量依赖自我报告，缺乏谦虚和不确定性的反映。需要一种考虑多维度和信心度的计算框架来改善心理学测量，并支持人道主义AI系统。

Method: 开发了一种模糊推理系统，使用Z数表示智慧得分（限制）和信心度得分（确定性）。通过100名参与者的语言响应进行分析，将其映射到智慧的5个理论组成部分，然后使用21条规则和高斯核密度估计进行结合。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为具有不确定性感知的多维构造，不仅推进了心理学测量，还为AI系统提供了可解释的、信心敏感的推理能力，在严格计算与类人判断之间找到了安全的中间地带。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

*Nicola Gigante,Francesco Leofante,Andrea Micheli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于反事实场景的新颖解释范式，用于自动规划领域，通过最小化修改规划问题来识别满足特定性质的可行计划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的反事实解释仅关注最小化修改现有计划来改变输出，但无法捕捉问题的高层特性。需要一种能够识别问题层面修改的解释方法

Method: 提出基于反事实场景的解释范式，给定规划问题P和LTLf公式ψ，识别对P的最小修改使得存在满足ψ的计划。提出了两种基于显式量化满足ψ计划的定性实例化方法

Result: 分析了生成反事实场景的计算复杂度，证明其通常与计算P的计划成本相当，展示了方法的实际可行性

Conclusion: 该框架为构建实用算法提供了基础，反事实场景生成在计算上是可行的，能够有效解释规划问题的高层特性

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

*Eduardo Illueca-Fernandez,Kaile Chen,Fernando Seoane,Farhad Abtahi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI是一个GenAI框架，通过整合多个大语言模型(LLM)来自动解释过程挖掘结果并生成报告，简化了医疗保健领域过程挖掘的应用，使技术分析结果更容易被临床医生、数据科学家和研究人员理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在医疗保健工作流分析中具有强大潜力，但面临技术复杂性、缺乏标准化方法和实践培训资源有限等障碍，需要开发更易用的解决方案。

Method: 开发HealthProcessAI框架，作为现有Python(PM4PY)和R(bupaR)过程挖掘库的封装，集成多个LLM进行自动化过程图解释和报告生成，使用脓毒症进展数据作为概念验证案例，并通过OpenRouter平台比较5个最先进LLM模型的输出。

Result: 框架成功处理了四个概念验证场景的脓毒症数据，展示了强大的技术性能和自动化LLM分析生成报告的能力。LLM评估显示Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro在自动化评估中获得最高一致性分数(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动的解释，代表了将复杂过程挖掘结果转化为医疗保健应用可操作见解的方法学创新，解决了过程挖掘输出普遍不熟悉的问题。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

*Issa Hanou,Sebastijan Dumančić,Mathijs de Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过学习基于状态函数的广义野标图框架，能够在规划问题中发现跨域通用的中间目标，支持循环重复子计划，通过广义野标图构建消除性质作为新问题解决中的消除性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野标提取算法在某些规划问题中效果不佳，需要一种能够自动模拟域内野标的方法，这些野标应该能够描述中间目标并涉及重复性子计划。

Method: 从解决的问题实例中学习基于状态函数的广义野标，这些函数不依赖于具体对象，可应用于所有相似对象。构建有向广义野标图，包含循环可能性。将这个图用亊消除性质作为解决新问题实例的消除性质。

Result: 学习自少数小型实例的广义野标图在同一域的更大实例中也有效。如果识别出表示重复的循环，消除性质性能比基准有显著提升。

Conclusion: 广义野标能够捐捕可解释的域信息，对自动规划器有用，这些信息可以从同一域的少数计划中发现。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Method: 基于联合均衡搜索框架，设计了迭代确定性POMDP规划（IDPP）算法，优化处理大规模Det-Dec-POMDPs

Result: IDPP算法能够高效处理当前Dec-POMDP求解器无法处理的大规模确定性多机器人规划问题

Conclusion: 该研究为确定性多机器人规划领域提供了一种实用的解决方案，IDPP算法在效率和可扩展性方面表现优异

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合复杂运筹学输出与业务利益相关者理解之间的差距，通过自然语言摘要、情境可视化和定制化KPI来提升决策支持效果

Method: 采用混合整数规划模型处理多周期多物品的库存再分配问题，技术架构包含AI代理、RESTful API和动态用户界面，支持实时交互和模拟分析

Result: 案例研究表明系统能够预防缺货、降低成本并维持服务水平，显著改善规划结果

Conclusion: 未来将整合私有LLM、迁移学习、强化学习和贝叶斯神经网络，以增强可解释性、适应性和实时决策能力

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

*Ramkumar Natarajan,Muhammad Suhail Saleem,William Xiao,Sandip Aine,Howie Choset,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了A-MHA*算法，将多启发式A*（MHA*）扩展为随时算法，能够快速找到可行次优解并持续改进，直到时间耗尽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳的启发式函数来加速搜索，但它是单次算法，无法随时间改进解的质量，需要仔细设置膨胀因子。

Method: 受随时修复A*（ARA*）启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发了A-MHA*算法。

Result: 在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域的实验表明，A-MHA*相比MHA*和其他随时算法具有更好的性能。

Conclusion: A-MHA*保留了MHA*的次优性和完备性保证，同时实现了随时搜索能力，能够快速获得可行解并持续优化。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY框架通过保留多个AI模型的多样性输出来利用偏见，而非消除偏见，将AI不完美性转化为医疗推理资源


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学AI将偏见视为需要消除的缺陷，但人类推理本身就包含偏见，这些偏见可能具有价值。MEDLEY旨在利用模型多样性来增强医疗决策

Method: 开发MEDLEY概念框架，协调30多个大型语言模型，保留共识和少数观点，将幻觉视为待验证的假设，使诊断不确定性和偏见透明化

Result: 概念验证演示器成功展示了如何保持模型多样性，使诊断不确定性和潜在偏见对临床监督透明

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过重新定义AI不完美性为资源，为开发可信赖的医疗AI系统开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

TL;DR: PosterForest是一个无需训练的科学海报生成框架，通过层次化中间表示和多智能体协作策略，实现了文本和视觉元素的语义整合与层次结构保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽视了科学文档的层次结构以及文本和视觉元素的语义整合，导致生成的海报在逻辑一致性和视觉连贯性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出Poster Tree层次化中间表示，采用多智能体协作策略（内容摘要和布局规划智能体），通过迭代协调和相互反馈实现联合优化。

Result: 在多个学术领域的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估上均优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计，在信息保留、结构清晰度和用户偏好方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架有效解决了科学海报生成中的结构层次和语义整合问题，为自动化科学海报生成提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于旅行商问题的变分量子算法，通过紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求，采用优化-冻结-重用策略，在训练实例上优化电路结构后冻结并重用于新实例，仅需快速重新优化电路参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统变分量子算法中每次遇到新问题实例都需要进行昂贵结构搜索的问题，降低NISQ设备上的实现成本和时间。

Method: 使用紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求；采用优化-冻结-重用策略：先在训练实例上用模拟退火优化电路拓扑，然后冻结结构，在新实例上仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的40个随机对称实例上，4城市达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示方法的可扩展性限制。

Conclusion: 该方法对中等规模问题展现出强大的泛化能力，冻结Ansatz能显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但存在可扩展性限制，有望扩展到车辆路径和作业调度等更复杂问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在给定摘要因果图背景知识下，保证时间变量间微观层面边可定向性的条件，为复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是当完整的因果结构未知时。专家通常能够提供摘要因果图来捕捉主要因果关系，但如何利用这种高层抽象来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在假设存在忠实且因果充分的分布条件下，给定摘要因果图背景知识时，保证微观层面时间变量间边可定向性的条件。这些条件即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也适用。

Result: 建立了微观层面边定向的理论保证，证明了在摘要因果图的指导下，即使宏观层面存在复杂结构（如循环或双向边），微观层面的因果关系仍然可以被正确识别。

Conclusion: 研究结果为利用摘要因果图指导复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供了实用指导，强调了将专家知识融入观测时间序列数据因果推理的价值，提高了从观测数据中推断因果关系的可靠性。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过树搜索和双层采样过程解决非凸目标、不可微分约束和多奖励结构的规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准梯度引导在现实世界非凸、不可微分和多奖励场景中效果有限，现有监督规划方法需要任务特定训练，限制了测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: 将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，使用双层采样：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹进行探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹。

Result: 在迷宫金币收集、机器人手臂块操作和AntMaze多目标探索三个任务上，TDP始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过探索多样化轨迹区域并利用扩展解空间中的梯度信息，仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号，有效解决了梯度引导的局限性。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:
