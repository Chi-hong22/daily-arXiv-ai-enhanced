TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐式感知冲击的框架，用于机器人在捕捉飞行物体时减少冲击力和反弹，分为预捕捉和后捕捉两个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人捕捉飞行物体时因高冲击力导致的任务失败和硬件损坏问题，特别是在物体质量与机器人负载比例较高时。

Method: 预捕捉阶段使用实时最优运动规划器生成轨迹以减少冲击力；后捕捉阶段基于人类示范生成轨迹以平滑耗散物体能量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效减少冲击力，避免关节扭矩过大，并展示了在多轴捕捉中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了机器人捕捉飞行物体的性能，尤其在减少冲击力和反弹方面表现优异。

Abstract: Robotic catching of flying objects typically generates high impact forces
that might lead to task failure and potential hardware damages. This is
accentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the
strong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address
this problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that
accomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the
first phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize
catching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated
smoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a
real-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the
end-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the
object to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the
robot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on
human demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with
unknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used
to enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a
stack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a
secondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one
dimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics
proposed. We show how the same task, without velocity matching, would be
infeasible due to excessive joint torques resulting from the impact. The
addition of reflected mass minimization is then investigated, and the catching
height is increased to evaluate the method's robustness. Finally, the setup is
extended to catching along multiple Cartesian axes, to prove its generalization
in space.

Abstract: We consider an online variant of the fuel-constrained UAV routing problem
with a ground-based mobile refueling station (FCURP-MRS), where targets incur
unknown fuel costs. We develop a two-phase solution: an offline heuristic-based
planner computes initial UAV and UGV paths, and a novel online planning
algorithm that dynamically adjusts rendezvous points based on real-time fuel
consumption during target processing. Preliminary Gazebo simulations
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in maintaining UAV-UGV path
validity, ensuring mission completion. Link to video:

### [3] [Model-Based Real-Time Pose and Sag Estimation of Overhead Power Lines Using LiDAR for Drone Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20812)
*Alexandre Girard,Steven A. Parkison,Philippe Hamelin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LiDAR的无人机电力线检测方法，通过最小化测量误差与整体几何模型的差异，解决了导体点稀疏、检测不一致和干扰物区分的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验表明，该方法在部分观测、噪声和异常点情况下仍能准确跟踪，求解器每帧收敛时间低于50毫秒，且对异常点的容忍度是有效测量点的两倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境下实现了高效准确的电力线检测，为无人机电力线巡检提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized,
significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone
relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several
challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the
number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently
detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from
other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an
estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a
single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than
tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data
from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves
accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the
presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis
shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier
points as valid conductors measurements.

Abstract: A cooperative circumnavigation framework is proposed for multi-quadrotor
systems to enclose and track a moving target without reliance on external
localization systems. The distinct relationships between quadrotor-quadrotor
and quadrotor-target interactions are evaluated using a heterogeneous
perception strategy and corresponding state estimation algorithms. A modified
Kalman filter is developed to fuse visual-inertial odometry with range
measurements to enhance the accuracy of inter-quadrotor relative localization.
An event-triggered distributed Kalman filter is designed to achieve robust
target state estimation under visual occlusion by incorporating neighbor
measurements and estimated inter-quadrotor relative positions. Using the
estimation results, a cooperative circumnavigation controller is constructed,
leveraging an oscillator-based autonomous formation flight strategy. We conduct
extensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the efficiency of the
proposed circumnavigation framework in occluded environments. Furthermore, a
quadrotor failure experiment highlights the inherent fault tolerance property
of the proposed framework, underscoring its potential for deployment in
search-and-rescue operations.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by
integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging
strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models
exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However,
applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps
without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the
critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream
applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA
model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's
ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the
process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews
post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor
learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A
structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1)
enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3)
deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key
challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing
a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a
comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human
motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

Result: 通过合成热数据增强多模态数据集，支持场景分割、目标检测和深度估计等任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为热相机的快速普及提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them.
However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime
or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can
provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due
to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that
are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this
paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and
automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal
datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene
segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone
of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal
imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic
thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We
explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images
to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of
real-world objects.

Result: 在VirtualHome WAH-NL和真实机器人实验中，成功率分别达到34%和25%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STEP框架有效提升了长时程任务规划的成功率，为机器人部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for
deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large
Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low
success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied
tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of
closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination
model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that
spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model
leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable
subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model
provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to
terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly
converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the
VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves
long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and
25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

Conclusion: V2X-REALM推动了端到端协同自动驾驶的可扩展性，为复杂驾驶条件下的鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and
visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for
autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in
cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and
reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose
V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive
multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail
scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven
long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation
models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across
vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity
efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that
modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or
corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning
objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario
feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM
significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning,
safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,
advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 该工作开创了知识驱动的数据高效学习方法，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm in robot manipulation,
yet its generalization capability remains constrained by object-specific
dependencies in limited expert demonstrations. To address this challenge, we
propose knowledge-driven imitation learning, a framework that leverages
external structural semantic knowledge to abstract object representations
within the same category. We introduce a novel semantic keypoint graph as a
knowledge template and develop a coarse-to-fine template-matching algorithm
that optimizes both structural consistency and semantic similarity. Evaluated
on three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, our method achieves superior
performance, surpassing image-based diffusion policies with only one-quarter of
the expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments further demonstrate its
robustness across novel objects, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. This
work pioneers a knowledge-driven approach to data-efficient robotic learning in
real-world settings. Code and more materials are available on

Method: 采用ADRC技术设计控制器，并通过包含真实波浪和洋流干扰的仿真及荷兰Scheveningen港和海上实地测试进行验证。

Result: ADRC显著降低了轨迹跟踪误差，但增加了控制能耗；海上试验中能耗进一步增加。

Conclusion: ADRC在轨迹跟踪性能上优于PID，但需权衡控制能耗的增加。

Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to
uncertain environmental disturbances like waves and currents. This paper
proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection
Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating
realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the
controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests
in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results
demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested
conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort
and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a
further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the
baseline.

Result: 实验表明CURL-SLAM在3D地图质量和轨迹精度上达到先进水平，并在CPU上实现实时性能（10 Hz）。

Conclusion: CURL-SLAM为LiDAR SLAM提供了高效、紧凑且一致的解决方案，并计划开源实现。

Abstract: This paper studies 3D LiDAR mapping with a focus on developing an updatable
and localizable map representation that enables continuity, compactness and
consistency in 3D maps. Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require
extensive storage to preserve structural details in large-scale environments.
In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the
Continuous and Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) introduced in [1].
Our proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps
capable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's
spherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency
after loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR
odometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique
optimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle
Adjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction.
Experimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D
mapping quality and competitive LiDAR trajectory accuracy, delivering
sensor-rate real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU. We will release the
CURL-SLAM implementation to the community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态风险感知模型预测路径积分控制（DRA-MPPI），用于实时处理非高斯随机预测的轨迹不确定性，提升移动机器人在动态环境中的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以处理任意形状预测和实时约束下的轨迹不确定性，导致机器人可能陷入“冻结”问题。

Method: 利用MPPI的无梯度特性，通过蒙特卡洛方法高效近似多动态障碍物的联合碰撞概率（CP），并集成到导航成本函数中。

Result: 实验表明，DRA-MPPI在安全性和性能上优于现有方法（如S-MPC、Frenet规划器和原始MPPI）。

Conclusion: DRA-MPPI有效解决了轨迹不确定性带来的挑战，提升了机器人在动态环境中的导航能力。

Abstract: Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to
account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This
remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily
shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI),
a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with
potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's
gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the
joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several
hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This
enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the
integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function.
Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing
safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles
demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet
planner, and vanilla MPPI.

Conclusion: ACTLLM通过语言和视觉的协同优化，显著提升了动态环境中的机器人操作能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces ACTLLM (Action Consistency Tuned Large Language Model),
a novel approach for robot manipulation in dynamic environments. Traditional
vision-based systems often struggle to learn visual representations that excel
in both task execution and spatial reasoning, thereby limiting their
adaptability in dynamic environments. ACTLLM addresses these challenges by
harnessing language to craft structured scene descriptors, providing a uniform
interface for both spatial understanding and task performance through flexible
language instructions. Moreover, we introduce a novel action consistency
constraint that aligns visual perception with corresponding actions, thereby
enhancing the learning of actionable visual representations. Additionally, we
have reformulated the Markov decision process for manipulation tasks into a
multi-turn visual dialogue framework. This approach enables the modeling of
long-term task execution with enhanced contextual relevance derived from the
history of task execution. During our evaluation, ACTLLM excels in diverse
scenarios, proving its effectiveness on challenging vision-based robot
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: This research addresses critical autonomous vehicle control challenges
arising from road roughness variation, which induces course deviations and
potential loss of road contact during steering operations. We present a novel
real-time road roughness estimation system employing Bayesian calibration
methodology that processes axle accelerations to predict terrain roughness with
quantifiable confidence measures. The technical framework integrates a Gaussian
process surrogate model with a simulated half-vehicle model, systematically
processing vehicle velocity and road surface roughness parameters to generate
corresponding axle acceleration responses. The Bayesian calibration routine
performs inverse estimation of road roughness from observed accelerations and
velocities, yielding posterior distributions that quantify prediction
uncertainty for adaptive risk management. Training data generation utilizes
Latin Hypercube sampling across comprehensive velocity and roughness parameter
spaces, while the calibrated model integrates seamlessly with a Simplex
controller architecture to dynamically adjust velocity limits based on
real-time roughness predictions. Experimental validation on stochastically
generated surfaces featuring varying roughness regions demonstrates robust
real-time characterization capabilities, with the integrated Simplex control
strategy effectively enhancing autonomous vehicle operational safety through
proactive surface condition response. This innovative Bayesian framework
establishes a comprehensive foundation for mitigating roughness-related
operational risks while simultaneously improving efficiency and safety margins
in autonomous vehicle systems.

Result: WorldVLA优于独立动作和世界模型，但自回归动作生成性能下降。注意力掩码策略显著提升了动作块生成任务的表现。

Conclusion: WorldVLA展示了世界模型与动作模型的相互增强效果，注意力掩码策略有效解决了自回归动作生成的误差传播问题。

Abstract: We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action
and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The
world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image
understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the
environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates
the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual
understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We
demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,
highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action
model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model
deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization
capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from
earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an
attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the
generation of the current action, which shows significant performance
improvement in the action chunk generation task.

*Qin Ren,Yifan Wang,Ruogu Fang,Haibin Ling,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv是一种基于最优传输（OT）的多实例学习（MIL）框架，用于从全切片图像（WSIs）中预测生存率，通过全局和局部约束显式建模病理异质性，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法未能显式捕捉WSIs中的病理异质性，包括全局的长尾形态分布和局部的瓦片级预测不确定性。

Method: OTSurv将生存预测建模为具有全局长尾约束和局部不确定性约束的OT问题，并通过不平衡OT公式高效求解。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，OTSurv的平均C-index绝对提升了3.6%，并在对数秩检验中达到统计显著性。

Conclusion: OTSurv是一种高效、可解释的生存预测工具，适用于数字病理学。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

*Haodong Li,Chen Wang,Jiahui Lei,Kostas Daniilidis,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoDiff结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散，通过两阶段方法提升视频深度估计的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度估计不应简单扩展图像深度估计，静态和动态区域的时序一致性需求不同。

Method: StereoDiff两阶段方法：静态区域用立体匹配，动态区域用视频深度扩散。

Result: 在零样本和真实世界动态视频深度基准测试中表现最优。

Conclusion: StereoDiff通过互补方法显著提升了视频深度估计的性能。

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

TL;DR: ConViTac提出了一种视觉-触觉表示学习网络，通过对比表示增强特征融合的对齐性，显著提升了材料分类和抓取预测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉和触觉是机器人感知和操作任务中的两种基本感官模态，但现有方法在模态融合时特征整合效果不佳。

Method: 提出ConViTac网络，采用对比嵌入条件（CEC）机制，通过自监督对比学习预训练的编码器将视觉和触觉输入投影到统一的潜在嵌入中，并通过跨模态注意力进行特征融合。

Result: 实验表明，ConViTac在材料分类和抓取预测任务中的准确率提升了12.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ConViTac通过对比表示和跨模态注意力机制，显著提升了视觉-触觉特征融合的效果和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文比较了多种医学图像分割模型（如SAM、SAM 2、MedSAM、SAM-Med-3D和nnU-Net）在BraTS 2023数据集上的零样本推理性能，发现SAM和SAM 2在精确边界框提示下表现优异，但nnU-Net仍是主导模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对不同提示质量下医学图像分割模型的统一评估与比较，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用多种模型进行零样本推理，并在儿科数据集上微调，评估不同提示（点和边界框）的性能。

Result: SAM和SAM 2在精确边界框提示下Dice分数最高（0.894和0.893），但nnU-Net整体表现更优。微调后点提示性能显著提升，但仍不及边界框或nnU-Net。

Conclusion: nnU-Net仍是医学图像分割的黄金标准，但SAM系列模型在特定条件下表现优异，未来研究可进一步优化提示策略。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在嘈杂环境中，手势是非人机交互的重要方式，传统深度学习依赖任务特定架构，而VFM和VLM的泛化能力可能简化系统。

Method: 比较V-JEPA、Gemini Flash 2.0和HD-GCN在动态全身手势识别中的表现，使用NUGGET数据集评估。

Result: HD-GCN表现最佳，V-JEPA接近且简化了系统，Gemini在零样本设置下表现不佳。

Conclusion: V-JEPA有望作为共享多任务模型简化系统，但需进一步研究适合手势的输入表示。

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化框架，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）从扩散模型生成的多幅超分辨率图像中选择最可信的样本，并通过混合指标（TWS）量化其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超分辨率（SR）问题中单一回归模型在保真度和感知质量之间的权衡问题，以及扩散模型生成多样样本后选择可信样本的挑战。

Method: 利用VLMs（如BLIP-2、GPT-4o）进行语义推理评估，结合CLIP嵌入、SSIM边缘图和多级小波分解，提出TWS指标量化可靠性。

Result: TWS与人类偏好高度相关，VLM引导的选择能持续获得高TWS值，优于传统指标（如PSNR、LPIPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成式SR提供了可扩展、通用的可信度评估方案，设定了新的可信度基准。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督领域泛化中标签稀缺导致领域泛化方法性能不足的问题。

Method: 引入FixCLR，结合伪标签类别信息和排斥项，显式正则化领域不变表示。

Result: FixCLR显著提升性能，尤其在与其他半监督方法结合时表现更优。

Conclusion: FixCLR是有效的半监督领域泛化方法，适用于多领域数据集。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以全面捕捉视频中的所有声音事件，且缺乏灵活性。本文旨在通过分步生成和条件引导，实现更高质量的音频合成。

Method: 采用分步视频到音频生成方法，每步基于目标文本提示和已生成音频轨道进行条件合成，利用预训练模型避免专用数据集需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能为单个视频生成多个语义不同的音频轨道，合成音频质量优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 分步生成和条件引导的方法有效提升了视频到音频合成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习（CL）在自监督预训练（SSP）中表现优异，但在像素级表示中存在过分散问题，破坏了像素级特征相关性。

Method: 提出向量对比学习（vector CL），将CL重新定义为向量回归问题，通过COVER框架实现向量自学习、优化流一致性和粒度适应。

Result: 在8个任务、2个维度和4种模态的实验中，COVER显著提升了像素级SSP性能。

Conclusion: COVER框架有效解决了像素级表示中的过分散问题，为医学视觉基础模型提供了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

Motivation: 在真实场景中，模糊面部表情的准确识别至关重要，但现有方法对此处理不足。

Method: MIDAS通过结合视频帧及其对应的软标签（多情绪类别的概率）来增强训练数据，扩展了mixup方法到视频数据。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k-Plus数据集上的实验表明，MIDAS训练的模型性能优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS是一种简单高效的数据增强方法，显著提升了DFER任务中模糊表情的识别能力。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

TL;DR: ThirdEye是一种显式利用单目视觉线索的深度估计方法，通过预训练网络提供线索，并结合记忆模块和自适应变换器生成高分辨率视差图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目深度估计方法隐式学习忽略了人类视觉系统依赖的显式线索（如遮挡边界、阴影和透视），ThirdEye旨在通过显式提供这些线索改进深度估计。

Method: ThirdEye通过预训练且冻结的专家网络提供视觉线索，结合三阶段皮层层次结构和记忆模块加权融合线索，最终由自适应变换器生成视差图。

Result: ThirdEye继承了外部监督的优势，仅需少量微调，但具体定量结果将在未来版本中公布。

Conclusion: ThirdEye通过显式利用视觉线索和记忆模块，提供了一种更高效的深度估计方法，未来将公布更多实验结果。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

*Advait Gupta,Rishie Raj,Dang Nguyen,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FaSTA$^*$的高效神经符号代理，结合LLMs的快速高层规划和A$^*$搜索的精确工具使用，用于多轮图像编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮图像编辑任务中高成本和低效率的问题，通过结合快速规划和精确搜索实现高效工具路径规划。

Method: 结合LLMs的高层规划和A$^*$搜索的局部精确搜索，通过归纳推理提取常用子程序并复用，减少探索成本。

Result: FaSTA$^*$在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，同时保持与最先进基线相当的成功率。

Conclusion: FaSTA$^*$通过自适应快慢规划，显著提升了多轮图像编辑任务的效率和成本效益。

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

*Ju-Hyeon Nam,Dong-Hyun Moon,Sang-Chul Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2SFormer是一种基于Transformer编码器的新框架，通过统一多频率和多尺度注意力，结合全局先验图，显著提升了图像伪造定位的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在像素级伪造定位中存在计算开销大和表示能力有限的问题，尤其是对细微或复杂篡改的处理不足。

Method: 提出M2SFormer框架，统一多频率和多尺度注意力，利用全局先验图指导注意力模块，保留细微篡改细节。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，M2SFormer优于现有最先进模型，展现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M2SFormer通过创新设计解决了伪造定位中的关键挑战，为图像编辑检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

*Hao Zhang,Haolan Xu,Chun Feng,Varun Jampani,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysRig提出了一种基于物理的皮肤绑定框架，解决了传统线性混合皮肤绑定（LBS）的体积损失和变形不自然问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LBS方法存在体积损失和无法模拟弹性材料的缺陷，PhysRig旨在通过物理模拟解决这些问题。

Method: 将刚性骨架嵌入体积表示（如四面体网格），利用连续介质力学和粒子离散化确保可微性，并引入材料原型减少学习空间。

Result: PhysRig在合成数据集上优于传统LBS方法，生成更真实且物理合理的结果。

Conclusion: PhysRig在皮肤绑定和姿态迁移任务中表现出色，为关节物体建模提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera
network suitable for this purpose. We also present a benchmark when applying
three commonly used approaches and a general-purpose baseline when trained and
tested on three publicly available datasets, in addition to our own, when
compared against a recently ratified ASTM standard.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HST-CSLR的方法，通过结合大语言模型的文本知识和视觉表示学习，提升连续手语识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模数据集和精确标注，连续手语识别（CSLR）面临训练数据不足的问题。现有方法未能充分利用文本知识。

Method: 提出层次化子动作树（HST），结合大语言模型的文本知识，逐步对齐视觉和文本模态，并通过对比对齐增强减少模态差异。

Result: 在四个数据集（PHOENIX-2014、PHOENIX-2014T、CSL-Daily和Sign Language Gesture）上验证了HST-CSLR的有效性。

Conclusion: HST-CSLR通过更有效地利用文本知识，提升了连续手语识别的性能。

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

distinctive features: (i) Full-modal collaboration: We design evaluation tasks
that highlight the strong coupling between audio and video, requiring models to
effectively leverage the collaborative perception of all modalities; (ii)
Diversity of videos: OmniEval includes 810 audio-visual synchronized videos,
285 Chinese videos and 525 English videos; (iii) Diversity and granularity of
tasks: OmniEval contains 2617 question-answer pairs, comprising 1412 open-ended
questions and 1205 multiple-choice questions. These questions are divided into
3 major task types and 12 sub-task types to achieve comprehensive evaluation.
Among them, we introduce a more granular video localization task named
Grounding. Then we conduct experiments on OmniEval with several omni-modality

Conclusion: PathChat+和SlideSeek为病理学提供了更强大的多模态理解和自主诊断能力，推动了数字病理学的发展。

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,
humanly-interpretable summary reports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在Video DiTs上计算开销大，需资源密集型操作，DFVEdit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV)和结合Implicit Cross Attention (ICA)与Embedding Reinforcement (ER)，直接在潜在空间操作。

Result: DFVEdit在推理速度上提升20倍，内存减少85%，并在结构保真度、时空一致性和编辑质量上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: DFVEdit为Video DiTs提供了一种高效、高质量的编辑方案，适用于多种流行模型。

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Cradle2Cane的两阶段人脸老化框架，通过自适应噪声注入和身份感知嵌入解决了年龄准确性和身份保留的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸老化方法难以在年龄准确性和身份一致性之间取得平衡，尤其是在处理大年龄跨度或极端头部姿态时。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散模型框架：第一阶段通过自适应噪声注入（AdaNI）实现年龄准确性；第二阶段通过身份感知嵌入（IDEmb）增强身份保留。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ测试数据集上，Cradle2Cane在年龄准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane通过两阶段设计有效解决了Age-ID权衡问题，为人脸老化任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

Conclusion: GoIRL框架在轨迹预测任务中表现出色，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机成像中的光度失真会降低图像质量，进而影响3D场景表示。传统方法未考虑这些失真，导致表示质量下降。

Method: 引入内外光度模型，提出完整光度模型和相机表示，通过联合优化相机参数和深度正则化，分离场景无关信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在成像退化条件下（如渐晕和污垢）仍能生成高质量的3D场景表示。

Conclusion: 联合光度优化和深度正则化的方法有效提升了3D场景表示的质量，尤其在成像退化情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D
semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF)
leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art
OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m
region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The
established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: 稀疏信号在姿态引导的图像生成中具有潜力，SP-Ctrl为这一方向提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

Motivation: 全景图像处理面临失真、遮挡和标注不足的挑战，传统方法依赖源数据，限制了实用性。

Method: UNLOCK包含两个模块：Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning和Amodal-Driven Context Learning，无需源数据或目标标签即可适应。

Result: 在实验中，UNLOCK性能接近依赖源数据的方法，取得了10.9 mAAP和11.6 mAP的先进分数，mAPQ提升了+4.3。

Conclusion: UNLOCK为全景图像分割提供了一种更实用的解决方案，性能优异且开源。

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像分割在癌症诊断和预后分析中至关重要，但现有方法因数据标注不足和类别定义限制而难以满足临床需求。

Method: 提出PathSegmentor模型和PathSeg数据集，支持通过自然语言提示进行语义分割，无需繁琐的空间输入。

Result: PathSegmentor在Dice分数上显著优于现有模型，表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力，同时提升了诊断模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: PathSegmentor推动了精准肿瘤学中可解释AI的发展，为临床决策提供了基于证据的支持。

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在点级任务（如分割）中表现不佳，主要因缺乏直接的3D-文本对齐能力，无法将局部3D特征与文本上下文关联。

Method: TSDASeg采用两阶段模型，结合直接跨模态对齐模块和记忆模块。记忆模块通过专用存储库动态更新场景特征。

Result: 在多个3D分割数据集上实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: TSDASeg通过跨模态对齐和动态记忆机制，显著提升了交互式点云分割的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D立方体标注方法依赖昂贵设备，限制了大规模数据收集的可及性。

Method: 通过用户点击车辆特征点，结合几何约束优化（PnP和最小二乘子问题）和概率尺寸先验，解决尺度和维度模糊问题。

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes3D数据集上验证，标注质量高且成本低。

Conclusion: ToosiCubix为高质量3D标注提供了经济且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Result: 在C3VD静态数据集和StereoMIS动态数据集上的实验表明，该方法在新视图合成和姿态估计方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在内窥镜场景中表现优异，适用于静态和动态手术场景，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Result: 模型在动态模糊场景下表现稳健，为模糊单目视频输入设定了新的新视角合成基准。

Conclusion: DBMovi-GS方法有效解决了动态模糊场景下的新视角合成问题，提升了视觉保真度。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Conclusion: SAIC在临床应用中具有广泛的适用性和实用性。

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

Conclusion: SAM4D在多模态时序分割和数据标注方面表现出色，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

Motivation: 研究场景文本移除（STR）的潜在滥用风险，提出逆向分析方法以检测和定位移除的文本区域，防止滥用并改进STR技术。

Method: 通过逆向STR（ISTR）进行二分类（检测是否经过STR处理）和定位移除文本区域，并尝试训练文本识别器恢复移除内容。

Result: 实验表明ISTR在检测和定位任务中具有高准确性，但恢复移除文本内容较为困难。

Conclusion: ISTR可有效检测STR滥用并改进技术，但文本恢复仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

Result: 模型能够从第一人称视角预测环境变化，展示了具身预测和控制能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为从人类视角建模复杂环境和具身行为提供了初步尝试。

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of

Conclusion: VisionGuard有效提升头盔违规检测性能，有望推动交通安全和法规执行。

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

Motivation: 当前使用的2D标本放射成像（SR）方法在评估术中标本边缘状态时准确性有限，导致近四分之一的患者需要额外手术。

Method: 结合FFCL预训练策略和SAM模型，通过标注SR图像中的恶性、非恶性组织和病理确认的边缘区域，预训练ResNet-18进行分类，并利用SAM进行精细边缘分割。

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM显著提高了术中边缘评估的速度和准确性，有望降低再切除率并改善乳腺癌治疗效果。

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法通常将老化建模为单一确定性路径，缺乏多样性和可控性。

Method: 采用无训练扩散方法，结合注意力混合和模拟老化正则化策略，平衡身份保留、年龄准确性和条件控制。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法在身份保留、老化真实性和条件对齐方面表现优异，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 将老化转化为多维、可控且可解释的过程，为数字叙事、健康教育和个性化可视化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Conclusion: 该方法在移动视角合成系统中表现优异，支持更大场景的3D重建。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分数的指令生成（SIG）管道，用于视频质量评估（VQA），通过自动化生成指令数据，解决了传统方法依赖人工标注和专有系统的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA方法仅生成数值分数，无法描述视频的复杂质量维度，限制了其应用。通过利用语言输出，视频大型多模态模型（LMMs）有望解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SIG管道，自动为未标记视频评分并将分数映射到文本定义的级别，结合层次化思维链（CoT）建模具体维度与整体质量的关系。

Result: 生成的Score2Instruct（S2I）数据集包含32万多样化的指令-响应对，实验表明该方法显著提升了视频LMMs的质量评分和解释能力。

Conclusion: SIG方法通过自动化数据生成和渐进式调优策略，有效提升了视频LMMs的质量评估能力，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Conclusion: 该模型展示了量子图像生成的潜力，随着量子硬件的发展，未来前景广阔。

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态提示对齐框架MPA-FER，通过细粒度语义指导提升视觉语言模型在面部表情识别中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的面部表情识别方法难以捕捉细粒度的文本-视觉关系，导致对细微表情差异的区分能力不足。

Method: 结合多粒度硬提示生成策略（利用ChatGPT生成详细描述）和原型引导的视觉特征对齐，同时引入跨模态全局-局部对齐模块。

Result: 在三个FER基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保留了预训练模型的优势并降低计算成本。

Conclusion: MPA-FER框架通过细粒度语义指导和跨模态对齐，显著提升了面部表情识别的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Result: 在三个数据集上验证，参数和计算成本分别降低90%和85%，检测精度提升1%-3%。

Conclusion: LASFNet在效率和精度上取得良好平衡，代码将开源。

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be
open-sourced at https://github.com/leileilei2000/LASFNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D网格结构的图像token化方法计算需求高，1D潜在空间虽减少了token数量，但仍有改进空间。本文旨在通过1D二进制潜在表示进一步压缩图像表示。

Method: 采用1D二进制向量序列表示图像，替代传统one-hot编码，结合简单模型架构，显著减少token数量。

Result: 在1024x1024分辨率图像上仅需128个离散token，比标准VQ-VAEs减少32倍，训练和推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 1D二进制潜在表示方法高效且可扩展，无需私有数据或后训练优化，性能与现代图像生成模型相当。

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业RGB-D相机对非朗伯物体生成的深度图存在噪声和不完整问题，传统方法因数据多样性不足难以泛化。

Method: 提出DidSee框架：1）采用零终端信噪比噪声调度；2）设计单步训练方法减少误差累积；3）引入语义增强器联合完成深度补全与语义分割。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，并提升下游任务（如姿态估计和机器人抓取）的效果。

Conclusion: DidSee通过改进扩散模型和语义增强，显著提升了非朗伯物体深度补全的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

Conclusion: 扩散模型在域泛化与适应检测任务中具有优越性，为跨域视觉感知任务提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决文本引导扩散模型在图像编辑中可编辑性与忠实度之间的固有权衡问题。

Method: 引入忠实度引导以增强输入图像信息的保留，并采用调度策略解决可编辑性与忠实度的不对齐问题。

Result: 实验表明FGS在保持可编辑性的同时显著提升了忠实度，且兼容多种编辑方法。

Conclusion: FGS为图像编辑提供了一种高效平衡可编辑性与忠实度的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

Conclusion: 自监督ViT的双特征攻击方法dSVA在对抗样本的泛化性上表现优异，为对抗攻击研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

Conclusion: RoI-Matching任务和RoI-Matcher框架为文档分析提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

Conclusion: 形状先验与语言理解的结合对开放世界3D对象检索至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Method: 提出PoseMaster框架，利用3D骨骼作为姿势条件，并在训练中随机清空姿势和图像条件以提高控制效果和泛化性。

Result: 实验表明，PoseMaster在A-pose角色生成上优于现有技术，并能精确控制任意姿势。

Conclusion: PoseMaster通过统一框架和高质量数据集，显著提升了3D角色生成的效率和准确性。

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

Motivation: 立体匹配在自动驾驶系统中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法难以同时实现高精度和实时性能。大规模成本体积计算量大，而小规模成本体积信息不足。

Conclusion: ESM通过局部上下文连接和大感受野，以低计算成本实现了高精度实时立体匹配。

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OracleFusion的两阶段语义排版框架，用于解读甲骨文未解字符，结合多模态大语言模型和结构约束，显著提升了语义解读和视觉效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文作为早期古代语言，许多字符尚未解读，其复杂结构和抽象意象带来挑战。本文旨在通过技术手段辅助专家解读。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 利用增强空间感知推理的多模态大语言模型分析字形结构；2) 引入甲骨结构向量融合技术生成语义丰富的矢量字体。

Result: 实验表明，OracleFusion在语义、视觉吸引力和字形保持方面优于现有基线模型，提升了可读性和美学质量。

Conclusion: OracleFusion为甲骨文解读提供了专家级见解，是推动甲骨文研究的有力工具。

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

TL;DR: FlickCD提出了一种轻量级遥感变化检测模型，通过增强差异模块和多尺度局部-全局融合块，显著降低计算和存储开销，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习模型在遥感变化检测中计算复杂且资源消耗大，但精度提升有限。本研究旨在开发高效轻量级模型，满足卫星上处理的需求。

Method: FlickCD引入增强差异模块（EDM）突出关键特征差异，抑制无关变化；采用局部-全局融合块（SWSA和EGSA）捕捉多尺度语义信息。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，FlickCD计算和存储开销降低超过一个数量级，性能达到或接近SOTA水平（F1损失<1%）。

Conclusion: FlickCD在性能和资源消耗之间取得了优异平衡，适合卫星上处理，为遥感变化检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出新数据集MultiClip-Bench和新模型IPFormer-VideoLLM，以解决VideoLLMs在多镜头场景中的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VideoLLMs在多镜头场景（如不同视角或场景切换）中表现不佳，存在实例身份遗忘和关键帧忽略问题。

Method: 引入MultiClip-Bench数据集，并提出IPFormer-VideoLLM模型，通过实例提示注入和注意力机制聚合跨场景信息。

Result: 实验表明，新数据集和模型显著提升了多场景视频理解能力，并在多个视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究为多镜头视频理解提供了有效的数据集和模型解决方案。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

Motivation: 在动态3D环境中，实时更新场景表示对机器人、混合现实和具身AI至关重要，但传统方法计算开销大。

Method: CL-Splats通过变化检测模块分割场景中的动态和静态部分，进行局部优化，避免全局重新计算，并支持场景状态存储与恢复。

Result: 实验表明，CL-Splats在高效更新的同时，重建质量优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CL-Splats为实时3D场景重建任务提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测因缺陷类型多样、形状不规则、细粒度要求和复杂纹理而具有挑战性，现有AI检测方法存在冗余特征、细节敏感度不足和多尺度鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 采用BiFPN架构增强多级特征聚合，引入Detail-directional Fusion Module（DDFM）捕捉细粒度结构变化，并提出两种注意力融合策略（AC和CAF）优化上下文表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，YOLO-FDA在精度和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA通过细节增强和注意力融合，显著提升了工业表面缺陷检测的性能。

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

Result: 在包含107个类别的稀疏标注HSI数据集上达到SOTA性能，同时有效检测OOD像素。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在分割性能和OOD检测上均表现优异，适用于临床定义的语义层次结构。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合几何和感知先验，实现了高质量且一致的3D物体生成，为单视图重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

Result: 在三个公开Sim2Real基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAM框架有效缩小了Sim2Real领域差距，提升了点云分类的泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

Method: 提出Video-X^2L，包含双级KV压缩（生成低压缩和高压缩KV）和选择性KV重加载（解码阶段动态选择KV）。

Result: 在多个LVU基准测试中表现优异，显著节省计算成本。

Conclusion: Video-X^2L无需额外训练，兼容现有MLLMs，高效且实用。

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法未充分利用多步文本指令中的时序信息，且无法处理代词指代问题，导致在SG3D任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出GroundFlow模块，选择性提取短期和长期步骤信息，结合上下文进行时序推理。

Result: 在SG3D基准测试中，GroundFlow显著提升基线方法准确率（+7.5%和+10.2%），并超越预训练的3D大语言模型。

Conclusion: GroundFlow为现有3DVG模型引入时序推理能力，在SG3D任务中实现最优性能。

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

Conclusion: MedPrompt结合了LLM的解释性和模块化CNN的效率，实现了可扩展的提示驱动医学图像分析。

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的生成内容充斥互联网，这些内容可能被重新用作训练数据，导致模型性能逐渐退化（模型崩溃）。水印技术是一种潜在的解决方案。

Method: 提出BitMark，通过在Infinity图像生成过程中在比特级别嵌入水印，跨多个尺度（分辨率）操作，保持视觉保真度和生成速度，同时对多种去除技术具有鲁棒性。

Result: BitMark不仅能在生成图像中嵌入水印，还能在后续模型训练中传递水印（放射性），即使是对扩散或自回归模型进行微调，水印仍可检测。

Conclusion: BitMark为预防图像生成模型的崩溃提供了一种可靠的方法，通过检测生成内容来避免性能退化。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉数据中虚假相关性对分布外性能的负面影响。

Method: 结合互信息最小化、虚假特征正则化和不变特征的对比学习。

Result: 在11个数据集上表现优于CoOp-OOD，基础类准确率提升15.27，新类准确率提升44.31。

Conclusion: DiMPLe在多模态学习中实现了更好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DuIOD的双增量目标检测方法，结合了类增量和域增量学习，解决了现有方法在真实场景中的局限性。通过DuET框架和方向一致性损失，实现了稳定的增量学习，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有类增量目标检测（CIOD）和域增量目标检测（DIOD）方法分别只能解决类增量或域增量问题，无法同时应对真实场景中的双重挑战。

Method: 提出DuIOD框架，采用基于任务算术的模型合并方法（DuET），并引入方向一致性损失以减少符号冲突。

Result: 在Pascal Series和Diverse Weather Series数据集上，DuET分别实现了+13.12%和+11.39%的RAI提升，同时保持了较高的平均保留指数（Avg RI）。

Conclusion: DuIOD和DuET框架有效解决了类增量和域增量学习的双重挑战，为实时目标检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: 解决现有视频虚拟试穿方法在时空一致性和细节保留上的不足。

Method: 将视频虚拟试穿建模为条件视频修复任务，采用3D时空注意力扩散变换器，结合多阶段训练和掩码策略。

Conclusion: ViTI通过视频修复框架显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的质量。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Motivation: 现有手术视频生成方法多为无条件生成，缺乏对手术动作和阶段的语义一致性，HieraSurg旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HieraSurg采用两阶段扩散模型：第一阶段预测粗粒度语义变化，第二阶段结合细粒度视觉特征生成视频。

Conclusion: HieraSurg在多层次手术信息整合上表现出色，具有实际手术应用的潜力。

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

Method: 结合数据混合（保留先前数据分布）和模型混合知识蒸馏（同时从过去和当前模型蒸馏知识），在数据和模型层面正则化MAE。

Result: 实验结果显示，CoSMAE比现有持续学习方法在MAE上提升了4.94%。

Conclusion: CoSMAE通过数据与模型层面的混合策略，有效减少了灾难性遗忘，提升了持续学习的性能。

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the
fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in
representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not
fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative
factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels.
Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging
synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable
to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of
disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive
empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new
interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors
encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of
disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is
possible and effective.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the

Conclusion: 该方法通过状态空间模型有效捕捉局部和全局动态，为长时手术视频分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

TL;DR: ShotBench是一个专为电影语言理解设计的基准测试，包含3.5k专家标注的QA对，评估了24个领先的视觉语言模型，发现其平均准确率不足60%。为解决这一问题，团队构建了ShotQA数据集（70k QA对）并开发了ShotVL模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在理解电影语言的细微差别方面表现不足，限制了AI辅助视频生成的精确性。

Method: 构建ShotBench基准测试和ShotQA数据集，通过监督微调和Group Relative Policy Optimization开发ShotVL模型。

Result: ShotVL在ShotBench上显著优于现有开源和专有模型，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: 团队开源了模型、数据和代码，以推动AI驱动的电影理解和生成领域的快速发展。

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

Result: 比较了多种场景图生成模型的性能，并展示了新关系类型在下游任务中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: CoPa-SG和新关系类型显著提升了场景图的理解和推理能力。

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 图像与点云特征通道注意力的差异可能导致匹配结果下降，场景中的相似结构可能导致冗余对应关系。

Method: 使用CAA增强模态内特征并抑制跨模态敏感性，GOS通过全局优化替代局部选择。

Result: 在RGB-D Scenes V2和7-Scenes数据集上实现了最先进的配准性能。

Conclusion: 提出的CAA和GOS模块显著提升了图像到点云的配准精度。

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastRef是一种高效的原型精炼框架，用于解决少样本工业异常检测（FS-IAD）中原型代表性不足的问题。通过特征转移和异常抑制两阶段迭代优化原型，显著提升了检测性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在少样本环境下主要依赖有限正常样本生成原型，但未充分利用查询图像统计信息，导致原型代表性不足。FastRef旨在通过系统整合查询图像特征优化原型。

Method: FastRef采用两阶段迭代过程：1）通过可优化变换矩阵将查询特征转移至原型；2）通过原型对齐抑制异常。特征转移通过线性重构实现，异常抑制则利用最优传输（OT）技术。

Result: 在MVTec、ViSA、MPDD和RealIAD四个基准数据集上的实验表明，FastRef在1/2/4-shot设置下均表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: FastRef通过特征转移和异常抑制显著提升了少样本工业异常检测的性能，为数据稀缺环境下的自动化检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

Motivation: 现有两阶段方法（先重建边缘点云再拟合参数曲线）存在优化间隙导致的误差累积问题，需要一种直接优化的方法。

Method: 提出了一种双向耦合机制，将参数曲线与边缘导向的高斯组件结合，形成可微渲染的曲线感知表示（CurveGaussian），并引入动态自适应拓扑优化框架。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接优化参数曲线，显著提升了重建质量和效率，为3D曲线重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Method: 开发了基于视觉的跟踪系统估计TMC，结合仿真工具SUMO评估信号配置性能，提出动态、静态和混合三种信号设计方法。

Result: 实验表明90和120秒的信号周期效果最佳，混合方法在高峰和非高峰时段表现更好，且区域交通分布影响信号设计选择。

Conclusion: 混合信号方法能有效适应多样化的交通模式，尤其在区域交通分布不均时表现优异。

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Result: XVerse实现了高保真、可编辑的多主题图像合成，并显著提升了对个体主题特征和语义属性的控制能力。

Conclusion: XVerse显著提升了复杂场景生成和个性化控制的能力，为多主题图像合成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

Result: 在MS-COCO和Flickr30k上实现了最先进的性能，无需依赖外部数据。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了集合表示的局限性，提升了跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Conclusion: HyperSORT提供了一种结构化映射方法，能够有效识别和处理医学影像数据集中的偏差，提升分割任务的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

*Kaiyu Song,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于低频信号改进的无分类器引导方法（LF-CFG），通过自适应阈值减少冗余信息，缓解过饱和和不真实伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高引导尺度在条件扩散模型中会导致过饱和和不真实伪影，低频信号中的冗余信息积累是主要原因。

Method: 引入自适应阈值测量冗余信息位置，并通过分析低频信息变化率确定合理阈值，采用降权策略减少冗余信息影响。

Result: 实验表明，LF-CFG在多种扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion-XL等）中有效缓解了过饱和和不真实伪影。

Conclusion: LF-CFG通过低频信号改进，显著提升了条件扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

Result: 在层次物种分类和检索任务中表现优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: RCME框架能有效建模层次结构，提升视觉-语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

Motivation: 解决源数据不可用时，教师模型因伪标签噪声导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出TITAN方法，将目标图像分为易和难子集，并引入查询令牌对抗模块以减少域间特征差异。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了TITAN的优越性，mAP提升显著，最高达22.7%。

Conclusion: TITAN通过优化伪标签生成和域间特征对齐，显著提升了无源域自适应目标检测的性能。

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出动态对数校准（DLC）方法，通过动态调整生成文本与视觉证据的对齐，减少大视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练无关的解码策略存在静态约束、效率低下和细节退化等问题，无法有效解决LVLM中的幻觉问题。

Method: DLC在解码阶段利用CLIP评估图像与生成文本的语义对齐，动态调整候选词的对数概率，并通过自适应权重机制平衡视觉引导与文本质量。

Result: 实验表明，DLC显著减少幻觉，优于现有方法，同时保持高效推理。

Conclusion: DLC是一种高效且有效的解码时解决方案，可提升LVLM的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

Method: 采用两阶段Prior-Adaptation训练策略，学习高斯头部先验并适应个体特征，包括音频-表情和表情-视觉先验，以及颜色MLP和身体修复器。

Result: GGTalker在渲染质量、3D一致性、唇同步准确性和训练效率上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GGTalker通过通用先验和个体适应的结合，显著提升了语音驱动3D说话头的生成质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: G²D有效解决模态不平衡问题，提升多模态学习性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

Conclusion: WAFT展示了高分辨率扭曲的潜力，为光流方法提供了新的设计方向。

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective
method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with
high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This
design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is
necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible

Result: 在四个下游任务中表现优异，ModelNet40准确率达95.1%，ScanObjectNN达92.75%。

Conclusion: StruMamba3D通过改进SSM处理，显著提升了点云表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

Result: 在视觉保真度、可编辑性和组合泛化性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成图像的编辑提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

TL;DR: VideoTex利用视频生成模型解决3D纹理合成中的空间和时间不一致问题，通过几何感知条件和结构UV扩散策略，生成更平滑、更一致的纹理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有纹理合成方法因缺乏全局上下文和几何理解导致不一致，而视频生成模型在时间一致性上表现出色。

Method: 结合几何感知条件和结构UV扩散策略，利用3D网格结构生成纹理。

Result: VideoTex在纹理保真度、接缝混合和稳定性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VideoTex为动态实时应用提供了高质量的时空一致纹理合成方案。

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

*Jiayi Zheng,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FairyGen是一个自动系统，能从单张儿童绘画生成故事驱动的卡通视频，保留其独特艺术风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注角色一致性和基础动作，缺乏对风格化背景生成和电影化镜头设计的支持。

Method: 使用MLLM生成结构化故事板，风格传播适配器确保视觉一致性，镜头设计模块增强多样性，3D代理角色生成物理合理动作，两阶段运动定制适配器分离身份与动作。

Result: 系统能生成风格一致、叙事结构清晰、动作自然的动画。

Conclusion: FairyGen在个性化故事动画方面具有潜力，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

*Pin Ren,Yan Gao,Zhichun Li,Yan Chen,Benjamin Watson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: IDGraphs是一种用于入侵检测的交互式可视化系统，通过流级跟踪和Histographs技术快速检测和分析网络攻击和异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前入侵检测系统在交互式检查、蠕虫传播模式分析和相关攻击发现方面支持有限，而高速路由器流量增长使这些问题更加突出。

Method: IDGraphs利用流级跟踪数据，时间轴为横轴，失败连接数为纵轴，并通过Histographs技术汇总大量跟踪数据，用户可交互查询和分析。

Result: 在包含1.79亿流级记录的真实数据集上，IDGraphs成功检测到端口扫描、蠕虫爆发、TCP SYN洪泛等攻击和异常。

Conclusion: IDGraphs通过可视化交互和高效数据分析，显著提升了入侵检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and
identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network
operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to
detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However,
existing IDS systems offer only limited support for 1) interactively examining
detected intrusions and anomalies, 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns, 3)
and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute
as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow.
  IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that
addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a
flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number
of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of
tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the Histographs [RW05]
technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may
then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting
subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view
highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are
difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis.
  We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M
flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system
successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including
port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed
attacks.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文扩展了Syrgkanis和Tardos的平滑性框架，用于自动竞价，提出了一种平衡异构代理类型平滑参数的技术，并展示了其在多种模型中的适用性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动竞价系统中异构代理行为的液体福利价格无政府状态（POA）问题，特别是针对混合自动竞价者（价值最大化者和效用最大化者）在ROI约束下的表现。

Method: 扩展平滑性框架，提出平衡平滑参数的技术，并通过数学程序求解最佳POA界限。方法适用于单物品和同时第一价格拍卖（FPA），并可扩展到更复杂的模型。

Result: 证明了单物品FPA的平滑性，并通过定理推导出同时FPA的POA界限。例如，混合自动竞价的POA为2.18。此外，扩展了模型适用范围，包括保留价和分数次可加估值等。

Conclusion: 提出的框架不仅简化了POA界限的证明，还具有扩展性和通用性，适用于更广泛的自动竞价模型和均衡分析。

Abstract: Online advertising systems have recently transitioned to autobidding,
enabling advertisers to delegate bidding decisions to automated agents. Each
advertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective
subject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their
relevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare
price of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which
simultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of
heterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA
bounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for
mixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for
additive valuations.
  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to
autobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters
across heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving
a POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)
Simplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous
FPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and
utility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)
Extendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve
prices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous
payment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first
(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of
the art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated
equilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing
algorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from
such agents have properties that keep their POA low.

*Uriel Feige*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of fair allocation of $m$ indivisible items to $n$
agents with monotone subadditive valuations. For integer $d \ge 2$, a
$d$-multi-allocation is an allocation in which each item is allocated to at
most $d$ different agents. We show that $d$-multi-allocations can be
transformed into allocations, while not losing much more than a factor of $d$
in the value that each agent receives. One consequence of this result is that
for allocation instances with equal entitlements and subadditive valuations, if
$\rho$-MMS $d$-multi-allocations exist, then so do $\frac{\rho}{4d}$-MMS
allocations. Combined with recent results of Seddighin and Seddighin [EC 2025],
this implies the existence of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log\log n})$-MMS allocations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补人们对帮助聊天机器人动机的研究空白，探索拟人化对亲社会行为的影响。

Method: 基于CASA框架，通过在线实验（N=244）测量参与者在协作任务中对聊天机器人的亲社会行为和意图。

Result: 聊天机器人的人类身份和情感表达增强了参与者的亲社会行为和意图，同理心在其中起中介作用。

Conclusion: 拟人化设计能有效促进人类对聊天机器人的亲社会行为，这对理解和推广此类行为具有重要意义。

Abstract: Chatbots are increasingly integrated into people's lives and are widely used
to help people. Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse
direction-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better
chatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,
little research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.
To address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)
framework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like
identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human
empathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and
intentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial
behaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which
chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the
reasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and
intentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and
emotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and
intention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative
analysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial
behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. We
discuss the implications of these results for understanding and promoting human
prosocial behaviors toward chatbots.

*Meira Gilbert,Miranda Wei,Lindah Kotut*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文分析了TikTok上“TikTok, Do Your Thing”趋势，探讨用户通过众包信息识别陌生人的行为及其社会影响。研究发现支持者多于反对者，反映了社区观念和算法参与的演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解用户对这一涉及公共领域监视和识别行为的趋势的反应，以及其对社交监视常态化的影响。

Method: 方法是对60个TikTok视频和1,901条用户评论进行定性分析。

Result: 结果显示19人被成功识别，支持评论（883条）远超反对评论（310条），反映了社区观念的变化。

Conclusion: 结论指出这一趋势是社交监视的演变，需关注其对隐私和性别双重标准的影响。

Abstract: ''TikTok, Do Your Thing'' is a viral trend where users attempt to identify
strangers they see in public via information crowd-sourcing. The trend started
as early as 2021 and users typically engage with it for romantic purposes
(similar to a ''Missed Connections'' personal advertisement). This practice
includes acts of surveillance and identification in the public sphere, although
by peers rather than governments or corporations. To understand users'
reactions to this trend we conducted a qualitative analysis of 60 TikTok videos
and 1,901 user comments. Of the 60 videos reviewed, we find 19 individuals were
successfully identified. We also find that while there were comments expressing
disapproval (n=310), more than double the number expressed support (n=883).
Supportive comments demonstrated genuine interest and empathy, reflecting
evolving conceptions of community and algorithmic engagement. On the other
hand, disapproving comments highlighted concerns about inappropriate
relationships, stalking, consent, and gendered double standards. We discuss
these insights in relation to the normalization of interpersonal surveillance,
online stalking, and as an evolution of social surveillance to offer a new
perspective on user perceptions surrounding interpersonal surveillance and
identification in the public sphere.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索触觉反馈在虚拟现实密集人群模拟中对用户行走行为的影响，以提升紧急疏散训练等应用的效果。

Method: 通过用户研究，分析触觉反馈对行走轨迹、骨盆角度和行走速度等指标的影响。

Result: 触觉反馈改变了用户的避碰动作，增加了行走轨迹长度和骨盆角度变化，并增强了用户对侧方和后方NPC的感知。

Conclusion: 触觉反馈提高了用户在虚拟现实环境中的碰撞敏感性和行为反应，有助于更真实的模拟体验。

Abstract: Human crowd simulation in virtual reality (VR) is a powerful tool with
potential applications including emergency evacuation training and assessment
of building layout. While haptic feedback in VR enhances immersive experience,
its effect on walking behavior in dense and dynamic pedestrian flows is
unknown. Through a user study, we investigated how haptic feedback changes user
walking motion in crowded pedestrian flows in VR. The results indicate that
haptic feedback changed users' collision avoidance movements, as measured by
increased walking trajectory length and change in pelvis angle. The
displacements of users' lateral position and pelvis angle were also increased
in the instantaneous response to a collision with a non-player character (NPC),
even when the NPC was inside the field of view. Haptic feedback also enhanced
users' awareness and visual exploration when an NPC approached from the side
and back. Furthermore, variation in walking speed was increased by the haptic
feedback. These results suggested that the haptic feedback enhanced users'
sensitivity to a collision in VR environment.

Motivation: 当前的字幕设计未能满足复杂可访问性需求，尤其是失语症患者面临理解障碍，需要更个性化的解决方案。

Method: 研究探讨如何开发适合失语症患者的未来媒体解决方案，强调包容性设计工具和方法。

Result: 提出通过适当的原型工具和方法，实现失语症患者在系统设计中的平等参与。

Conclusion: 呼吁采取行动，推动更包容的字幕设计和媒体研究，以改善失语症患者的观看体验。

Abstract: The consumption of subtitles via TVs, laptops and smartphones has the
potential to marginalize people based on their complex accessibility needs. The
current one-size-fits-all approach to this accessibility aid is no longer fit
for purpose and work is required to look at how it can be adapted to be
personalised for individual users based on individual context, content, and
consumption habits. People with Aphasia, for example, encounter significant
challenges in understanding subtitle texts.
  We see our work as a call to action for more inclusive practices, focusing on
how the thoughts and opinions of people with aphasia can be included in media
research. Our work investigates how to develop future media solutions for
people with aphasia to create a more inclusive media viewing environment. We
believe the key to this is appropriate prototyping tools and methods to allow
equitable inclusion in the system design process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在自然图像理解上表现良好，但在可视化理解上存在不足，无法解析数据到视觉的映射规则和提取结构化信息。

Method: 结合图表图像及其向量化表示、编码方案和数据特征，提出了一种新的向量格式，用于紧凑且准确地重建可视化内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，数据提取准确性和图表重建质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化理解提供了有效的解决方案，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them
requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data
relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural
image understanding, struggle with visualization due to their inability to
decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To
address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal
visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach
combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations,
encoding schemes, and data features. The proposed vector format enables compact
and accurate reconstruction of visualization content. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both data extraction accuracy and chart
reconstruction quality.

Result: 无插图的高细节显示与有插图的显示在搜索时间和准确性上无显著差异，仅无插图的低细节显示结果显著不同。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究任务复杂性、插图大小和细节级别的影响。

Abstract: A paradigm for the design of systems that manage level of detail in virtual
environments is proposed. As an example of the prototyping step in this
paradigm, a user study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of high
detail insets used with head-mounted displays. Ten subjects were given a simple
search task that required the location and identification of a single target
object. All subjects used seven different displays (the independent variable),
varying in inset size and peripheral detail, to perform this task. Frame rate,
target location, subject input method, and order of display use were all
controlled. Primary dependent measures were search time on trials with correct
identification, and the percentage of all trials correctly identified. ANOVAs
of the results showed that insetless, high detail displays did not lead to
significantly different search times or accuracies than displays with insets.
In fact, only the insetless, low detail display returned significantly
different results. Further research is being performed to examine the effect of
varying task complexity, inset size, and level of detail.

Result: 高透明度机器人让用户更倾向于将信息差异归因于外部因素，而用户普遍表现出对机器人的过度信任。

Conclusion: 研究强调了机器人透明度和访问控制的重要性，以及在医疗等敏感领域中用户过度依赖机器人的潜在风险。

Abstract: Advancements in robotic capabilities for providing physical assistance,
psychological support, and daily health management are making the deployment of
intelligent healthcare robots in home environments increasingly feasible in the
near future. However, challenges arise when the information provided by these
robots contradicts users' memory, raising concerns about user trust and
decision-making. This paper presents a study that examines how varying a
robot's level of transparency and sociability influences user interpretation,
decision-making and perceived trust when faced with conflicting information
from a robot. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects online study, 176 participants
watched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant and
suggesting a fictional user to take medication at a different time from that
remembered by the user. Results indicate that robot transparency influenced
users' interpretation of information discrepancies: with a low transparency
robot, the most frequent assumption was that the user had not correctly
remembered the time, while with the high transparency robot, participants were
more likely to attribute the discrepancy to external factors, such as a partner
or another household member modifying the robot's information. Additionally,
participants exhibited a tendency toward overtrust, often prioritizing the
robot's recommendations over the user's memory, even when suspecting system
malfunctions or third-party interference. These findings highlight the impact
of transparency mechanisms in robotic systems, the complexity and importance
associated with system access control for multi-user robots deployed in home
environments, and the potential risks of users' over reliance on robots in
sensitive domains such as healthcare.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated the utility of reductions in the level of
detail (LOD) in the periphery of head-tracked, large field of view displays.
This paper provides a psychophysically based model, centered around an eye/head
movement tradeoff, that explains the effectiveness of peripheral degradation
and suggests how peripherally degraded displays should be designed. An
experiment evaluating the effect on search performance of the shape and area of
the high detail central area (inset) in peripherally degraded displays was
performed, results indicated that inset shape is not a significant factor in
performance. Inset area, however, was significant: performance with displays
subtending at least 30 degrees of horizontal and vertical angle was not
significantly different from performance with an undegraded display. These
results agreed with the proposed model.

Abstract: The co creativity community is making significant progress in developing more
sophisticated and tailored systems to support and enhance human creativity.
Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient
foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a
systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers
cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and
writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in
the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions
relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task,
proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model
type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to
greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative
outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive,
can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations,
highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and
of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust.
Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for
early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to
user adaptation to AI systems.

Conclusion: 该设备在轻量化、触觉反馈和日常佩戴性之间取得了平衡，为触觉界面设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study presents a lightweight, wearable fingertip haptic device that
provides physics-based haptic feedback for dexterous manipulation in virtual
environments without hindering real-world interactions. The device, designed
with thin strings and actuators attached to the fingernails, ensures minimal
weight (1.55 g per finger) and preserves finger flexibility. Integrating the
software with a physics engine renders multiple types of haptic feedback (grip
force, collision, and sliding vibration feedback). We evaluated the device's
performance in pressure perception, slip feedback, typical dexterous
manipulation tasks, and daily operations, and we gathered user experience
through subjective assessments. Our results show that participants could
perceive and respond to pressure and vibration feedback. Through dexterous
manipulation experiments, we further demonstrated that these minimal haptic
cues significantly improved virtual task efficiency, showcasing how lightweight
haptic feedback can enhance manipulation performance without complex
mechanisms. The device's ability to preserve tactile sensations and minimize
hindrance to real-world operations is a key advantage over glove-type haptic
devices. This research offers a potential solution for designing haptic
interfaces that balance lightweight construction, haptic feedback for dexterous
manipulation, and daily wearability.

*Sajid Hussain,Muhammad Sohail,Nauman Ali Khan,Naima Iltaf,Ihtesham ul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFL是一种基于数据集大小特性的自适应联邦学习框架，通过实验揭示了数据集大小、模态类型对联邦学习效果的影响，并展示了其高效性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法主要关注模型异质性和聚合技术，忽视了数据集大小特性对训练动态的根本影响。

Method: 提出SAFL框架，基于数据集大小特性组织联邦学习，并在13个多模态数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 发现1000-1500样本为最优范围，结构化数据表现优于非结构化数据，大样本性能下降；SAFL平均准确率达87.68%，通信效率高。

Conclusion: SAFL填补了数据特性驱动联邦学习策略的空白，为实际部署提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模组学数据的增加需要能够处理复杂基因表达数据集并提供可解释结果的框架。

Result: 在膀胱癌和乳糜泻的案例研究中，E-ABIN成功识别了生物学相关的异常并揭示了疾病机制。

Conclusion: E-ABIN是一个用户友好且强大的工具，适用于生物网络中的异常检测和分析。

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解大脑和机器如何通过递归的结构-特异性对齐来最小化不确定性，揭示推理过程中的熵不对称性。

Method: 方法包括建立分层计算框架，从基础的方向熵最小化到四个层次的运作原则（核心推理约束、资源分配原则、时间引导动态和空间层次组合），并通过形式等价定理和模拟验证。

Result: 结果表明CCUP对齐推理具有效率优势，为大脑和机器的推理提供了统一的理论基础。

Conclusion: 结论是大脑不仅是推理机器，还是通过路径依赖和内容引导模拟实现结构-特异性对齐的循环一致熵梯度解析器。

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于树的方法（DTS和DTS*），通过重用过去计算来优化扩散模型的推理时间对齐，显著减少计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高噪声水平下估计不准确且未重用历史信息，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 将推理时间对齐建模为搜索问题，通过树结构传播终端奖励并迭代优化值估计。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上，DTS以10倍更少的计算匹配最佳基线；在文本生成和语言任务中，DTS*以5倍更少的计算匹配最佳样本。

Conclusion: DTS和DTS*通过重用信息提供了一种可扩展的推理时间对齐方法，将额外计算转化为更好的样本。

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明了FLIPD方法在现实假设下的正确性，并扩展了其在均匀卷积下的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（DMs）能够学习低维支撑的分布，但FLIPD方法的理论基础在非仿射子流形下尚未完善。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明了FLIPD在现实假设下的正确性，并探讨了均匀卷积下的类似结果。

Result: FLIPD在现实条件下仍能准确估计局部内在维度（LID），且在均匀卷积下也有类似表现。

Conclusion: 研究填补了FLIPD的理论空白，并扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification
for tackling complex scientific problems.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

Motivation: 研究LLM在微调后如何存储和提取新学习的关系信息，填补现有定位方法的不足。

Result: 发现信息通过提取和回忆两种路径传递，部分情况下需要两种路径共同作用。

Conclusion: 关系信息的提取和回忆路径在不同层和组件中发挥作用，揭示了LLM内部信息处理机制。

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

Motivation: 为了解决训练大型语言模型的高计算成本问题，研究低精度算术格式（如MX格式）在模型训练中的可行性和挑战。

Method: 通过训练近千个语言模型，并在不同权重-激活精度组合下进行实验，分析MX格式训练中的不稳定现象。通过控制实验和小型代理模型验证现象原因。

Result: 发现MX格式在较大计算规模下会导致损失的不稳定性，并提出通过修改精度方案或采用混合配置来稳定训练。

Conclusion: 某些混合精度配置可以恢复与全精度训练相当的性能，为低精度训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

Result: 潜在空间中的联合训练不仅减小了重构误差，还提高了扩散模型的性能，实现了计算加速。

Conclusion: 潜在条件扩散模型在数值模拟中既能保持预测精度，又能显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Conclusion: SPD为线性参数分解方法的规模化应用提供了新可能，推动了机制可解释性研究的发展。

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control
problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss
functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs
of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For
standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state
through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate
that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为AGTCNet的新型图-时序卷积网络，用于解决脑机接口（BCI）中多通道脑电图（EEG）信号的复杂时空依赖性问题，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够克服个体间和时间变化性的BCI系统，以帮助运动障碍患者更好地与环境互动。

Method: 利用EEG电极的拓扑结构作为归纳偏置，结合图卷积注意力网络（GCAT）学习时空EEG表征。

Result: AGTCNet在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，模型体积减少49.87%，推理时间缩短64.65%，分类准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: AGTCNet是一种高效且实用的BCI模型，为脑机接口的实际部署提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Motivation: 传统集成学习方法（如bagging、boosting和DES）计算成本高且对异构数据适应性不足，Hellsemble旨在解决这些问题。

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在对抗样本检测中表现出色，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

Result: 实验结果表明，SpLPG在多个真实数据集上能减少约80%的通信开销，同时基本保持链接预测的准确性。

Conclusion: SpLPG通过图稀疏化有效解决了分布式GNN在链接预测中的性能问题，显著降低了通信成本。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the

Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple
competing objectives in dynamic environments.

Result: LoRA微调中，模型规模和数据重复等因素对记忆的影响与预训练和全微调不同，且记忆风险更低。

Conclusion: LoRA微调是一种高效且低风险的微调方法，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has

Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit
rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the
need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and
MI300X architectures. In addition to the pipeline, we develop an online
inference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate
LLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.

Method: 通过重新分配预测概率质量，设计了一种对MIA-NN攻击鲁棒的方法，并引入基于总变差（TV）距离的新指标量化残留泄漏。

Result: 实验表明，RWFT在现有评估指标和新提出的TV指标上均优于现有方法，分别提升了2.79%和111.45%。

Conclusion: RWFT是一种高效且安全的遗忘方法，能够在不完全重新训练的情况下实现与完全重新训练相当的效果。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Result: 算法保证有效覆盖率并实现次线性遗憾，实验验证其构造更小预测集且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 动态模型选择和反馈优化显著提升多模型在线共形预测的效率和性能。

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

Conclusion: 学习条件需要超越目标策略的稳态分布的覆盖假设，区分了单策略复杂性度量与先前研究的情况，并开发了与主要结果接近的下界。

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

Conclusion: DL-LIME是一种有效的可解释AI方法，能够提升模型性能并提供决策洞察。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

Conclusion: 通过引入可学习的稀疏线性变换，新方法在保持高可解释性的同时提升了模型表达能力，适用于特征质量不高的场景。

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

Result: MSA在多个基准测试和评估指标中优于现有机器学习遗忘算法。

Conclusion: MSA为大型语言模型提供了一种灵活且高效的数据删除方法。

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算方法在捕捉几何特征和泛化新抗原界面方面存在不足，AbMEGD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: AbMEGD结合多尺度等变图扩散技术，利用几何深度学习整合原子级几何特征和残基级嵌入。

Result: 实验显示AbMEGD在氨基酸恢复率、改进百分比和CDR-H3区域的RMSD上优于DiffAb模型。

Conclusion: AbMEGD在结构完整性和功能优化上设定了新标准，为抗体设计提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

TL;DR: 提出SharpZO方法，通过两阶段优化提升零阶优化的视觉语言模型微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于反向传播的微调方法在内存受限设备上的不适用问题。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：全局探索平滑损失函数的ES阶段和局部稀疏零阶优化。

Result: SharpZO显著提升准确率和收敛速度，平均增益达7%。

Conclusion: SharpZO为内存受限设备提供高效微调方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型在离线强化学习中因迭代采样导致的高推理成本和训练不稳定性问题。

Result: 在离线强化学习和行为克隆基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了速度和适应性。

Conclusion: SSCP是一种高效、表达力强的框架，适用于深度强化学习和序列决策任务。

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

Method: 提出新颖的知识蒸馏技术，利用组合归一化流的独特性质，在中间层进行知识传递，从而提升小型学生模型的性能。

Result: 实验表明，通过蒸馏技术，学生模型可以显著缩小规模，同时在性能上大幅超越未蒸馏的模型，且模型越小，吞吐量提升越明显。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在组合归一化流中具有潜力，能够有效提升小型模型的性能，同时减少计算资源需求。

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

Result: 在11个下游任务中取得最优性能，验证了多模态数据整合的有效性。

Conclusion: TRIDENT证明了结合SMILES、文本和分类注释对分子属性预测的价值，为多模态分子表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

TL;DR: MoRA提出了一种基于Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning的方法，通过细粒度激活和稀疏选择rank-1专家，解决了持续学习中存在的干扰、冗余和路由模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习（CL）在大规模预训练模型中面临灾难性遗忘和任务干扰的挑战，现有方法（如LoRA-based MoE）存在干扰、冗余和路由模糊的问题。

Method: MoRA将每个rank-r更新分解为r个rank-1专家，每个专家独立推断其相关性，并通过稀疏选择和rank修剪实现自适应激活。

Result: 在CLIP和LLMs的持续学习任务中，MoRA显著提高了学习效果，减少了遗忘，并改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoRA通过细粒度专家选择和自适应激活，有效解决了持续学习中的干扰和冗余问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

Motivation: 现实世界的数据通常是动态的，而现有联邦学习方法多基于静态数据集，无法适应概念漂移导致的性能下降。

Method: 将概念漂移建模为马尔可夫链，引入“稳态泛化误差”评估模型对未来数据的适应能力，并提出基于KL散度和互信息的正则化算法。

Result: 实验证明，所提算法在周期性、渐变性、随机性三种漂移模式下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该算法能有效适应概念漂移，提升联邦学习的长期性能。

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

Result: 在多个基准数据集和架构上，RL-Selector优于现有方法，提升训练效率和泛化性能。

Conclusion: RL-Selector通过动态数据选择有效减少冗余，显著提升训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

Conclusion: 通过对抗性框架和遗憾感知机制，本文方法显著提升了技能发现的效率和多样性，尤其在高维环境中表现突出。

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中数据分布随时间变化（概念漂移），现有方法主要关注真实漂移，而忽略虚拟或标签漂移，导致灾难性遗忘。需要区分漂移来源并采取不同策略。

Method: 提出FedDAA框架，包含三个模块：聚类数量确定、真实漂移检测和概念漂移适应，以动态适应多源漂移并保留有用历史信息。

Result: 在Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，FedDAA比现有方法准确率提升7.84%至8.52%。

Conclusion: FedDAA通过区分漂移来源并动态适应，有效解决了联邦学习中的多源概念漂移问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Result: 实验表明，仅需少量合成数据微调即可显著提升LLMs的工具使用能力和整体性能。

Conclusion: 知识图谱生成的指令数据能有效提升LLMs的工具使用能力，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

Result: 发布了四个异构数据集和基准测试工具，支持全局和客户端级别的公平性评估。

Conclusion: FeDa4Fair为联邦学习的公平性研究提供了可复现的基准测试环境。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

Result: H-CMR在保持高性能的同时，支持通过概念和模型干预增强人机交互。

Conclusion: H-CMR在可解释性和性能上取得平衡，适用于需要背景知识的场景。

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

Conclusion: 方法未达到预期效果，但代码已开源供进一步研究。

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

Conclusion: 该方法为单细胞扰动数据分析提供了新思路，结合GRN和掩码机制显著提升了模型的实用性和解释性。

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Result: 在复杂导航环境中，该方法比传统鲁棒强化学习方法表现更优，路径更短且冲突更少。

Conclusion: 抗脆弱强化学习框架能有效应对动态对抗攻击，提升无人机导航的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

Conclusion: 抗脆弱强化学习在动态威胁环境中具有理论和实践可行性，能够提升决策的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽降低了复杂度，但忽略了查询范数并抑制负值，导致熵差距和交互缺失。

Method: 解耦查询和键矩阵为范数和方向两部分，设计范数感知的核函数和范数保持映射。

Result: NaLaFormer在视觉和语言任务中性能提升高达4.2%。

Conclusion: 提出的机制有效恢复了动态稀疏性和范数分布，提升了表达能力和效率。

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

TL;DR: DBConformer是一种双分支卷积Transformer网络，专为EEG解码设计，结合了时间和空间特征建模，显著优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN-Transformer混合模型在EEG解码中存在局部与全局特征整合不足及通道建模被忽视的问题。

Method: 提出DBConformer，包含时间分支和空间分支，分别建模长程时间依赖性和通道间交互，并引入轻量级通道注意力模块。

Result: 在五个运动想象数据集和两个癫痫检测数据集上，DBConformer性能优于10个基线模型，参数更少。

Conclusion: DBConformer在性能和可解释性上表现优越，适用于稳健且可解释的EEG解码。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code
is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）的框架，用于生成能逃避入侵检测系统（IDS）的隐蔽对抗攻击，并通过条件变分自编码器（CVAE）检测这些攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机在民用空域的广泛应用，传统异常检测方法难以识别新型威胁，且现有方法无法区分隐蔽对抗攻击与真实异常事件，因此需要更智能的入侵检测系统。

Method: 设计了一个基于cGAN的框架，生成对抗样本以欺骗IDS分类器，并使用CVAE通过负对数似然区分对抗样本与真实异常样本。

Result: 实验表明，基于CVAE的检测方法在识别隐蔽对抗攻击方面显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了高级概率建模在提升IDS对抗生成模型攻击能力中的重要性。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Motivation: 联邦学习在数据、计算和通信异构性方面面临挑战，现有方法仅依赖文本提示且忽略标签-域分布偏移。

Method: 采用双提示学习（全局和局部提示）和交叉融合模块，适应不同客户的数据分布。

Result: 在九种异构数据集上的实验表明，pFedDC优于现有方法。

Conclusion: pFedDC通过双提示和交叉融合有效解决联邦学习中的异构性问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

Method: 基于神经元线性行为的理论，提出层合并的压缩方法，并在实验中验证其有效性。

Result: 在多数测试模型中实现无损压缩至原始大小的1/4，且与现有压缩技术兼容。

Conclusion: 为神经网络压缩提供了一种新方法，支持更小、更高效的模型设计。

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了解决方案的多样性，同时保持了高质量。

Conclusion: 多样化小批量选择框架在药物发现中具有潜力，可加速满足未满足的医疗需求。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

Motivation: 现有持续性投票规则假设完全参与和完整偏好信息，但实践中部分参与是常态，导致公平性和代表性不足。

Method: 引入人工智能代理（Artificial Delegates）代表缺席选民，分析其对不同投票方法下公平性和代表性的影响。

Result: 缺席显著影响公平性，但人工智能代理能有效缓解这些影响，并在多种场景中提升系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 人工智能代理是提升持续性投票系统公平性和代表性的有效工具。

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 通用大语言模型（LLMs）通过监督微调（SFT）提升特定领域性能，但现有方法需要大量数据和昂贵调用。

Method: 通过单标记答案熵（ROC AUC 0.73）将训练数据分类，结合SFT和蒸馏进行微调。

Result: 在小型开放模型上，方法显著优于标准SFT（0.55 vs 0.43平均准确率），且数据需求减少62%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且性能接近蒸馏，为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

Conclusion: DiLoCoX是首个成功应用于100B参数以上模型的去中心化训练框架。

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100

Method: 提出基于前瞻原则和多轮策略的种子选择方法，分析种子采样和选择的度量标准。

Result: 实验表明新方法在SSE（k-means）和log-likelihood（k-GMM）上优于现有技术，且计算开销较小。

Conclusion: 新方法有望成为标准技术，并为理论分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Latent Prototype Routing（LPR）的新路由框架，通过聚类视角改进MoE架构中的专家路由，显著提升了专家负载均衡性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE系统存在严重的负载不均衡问题，导致模型容量和计算资源利用率低下。

Method: 提出LPR框架，从聚类角度重新设计专家路由，在不影响下游性能的前提下实现负载均衡。

Result: 实验表明，LPR将专家负载的基尼系数从0.70降至0.035，最小-最大负载比从1e-6提升至0.70，接近完美均衡。

Conclusion: LPR是一种高效的路由框架，能显著改善MoE架构的负载均衡问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

*Jingyao Li,Hao Sun,Zile Qiao,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Hong Xu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynamicBench是一个新基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）实时信息处理能力，结合网络搜索和本地报告数据库，在无文档和有文档场景下均优于GPT4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM基准（如故事生成或观点表达）无法满足实时信息处理需求，DynamicBench填补了这一空白。

Method: 采用双路径检索管道（网络搜索+本地报告数据库），结合领域知识，评估模型在有无外部文档下的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，DynamicBench在无文档和有文档场景下分别比GPT4o高出7.0%和5.8%。

Conclusion: DynamicBench有效评估LLM实时信息处理能力，其方法表现优异，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

### [212] [Lipschitz Bounds for Persistent Laplacian Eigenvalues under One-Simplex Insertions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21352)
*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明了持久拉普拉斯算子的特征值在添加单形时的变化具有均匀利普希茨界，为谱拓扑数据分析提供了特征值级别的鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持久拉普拉斯算子在生物学、物理学和机器学习中广泛应用，但其特征值在单形添加时的精确变化尚未明确，而下游工具（如热核签名和谱神经网络）依赖于这些特征值。

Method: 通过数学证明，提出了一个均匀利普希茨界，表明添加一个单形后，每个上持久拉普拉斯算子的特征值变化不超过该单形边界欧几里得范数的两倍。

Result: 证明了特征值在局部更新下的稳定性，为动态数据环境中的可靠误差控制提供了保障。

Conclusion: 该结果为谱拓扑数据分析提供了首个特征值级别的鲁棒性保证，确保了谱特征在局部更新下的稳定性。

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多模态上下文学习（ICL）在医学领域的潜力，提出了首个专家驱动的多模态ICL基准SMMILE，并评估了15种多模态大语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域需要从有限示例中快速适应多样化任务，但目前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在医学任务中的上下文学习能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过专家设计的SMMILE基准（包含111个问题和517个问题-图像-答案三元组）和其增强版SMMILE++，评估15种MLLMs的多模态ICL能力。

Result: 大多数模型表现中等或较差，ICL仅带来8%-9.4%的性能提升，且易受无关示例干扰（性能下降达9.5%）。示例顺序存在近因偏差，相关示例靠后性能提升可达71%。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在多模态医学任务中的上下文学习能力有限，存在关键局限性和偏差。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

Motivation: 解决像素强化学习中Q值分布不稳定的问题。

Method: 使用辅助损失函数（MSE）均衡Q值分布。

Result: 在MuJoCo和Atari任务中显著提升性能，样本效率和长期训练均有改进。

Conclusion: rQdia首次使无模型连续控制超越状态编码基线。

Abstract: rQdia regularizes Q-value distributions with augmented images in pixel-based
deep reinforcement learning. With a simple auxiliary loss, that equalizes these
distributions via MSE, rQdia boosts DrQ and SAC on 9/12 and 10/12 tasks
respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and
Data-Efficient Rainbow on 18/26 Atari Arcade environments. Gains are measured
in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of
rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state
encoding baseline.

Motivation: 针对低功耗DNN计算的需求，探索细粒度错误恢复与硬件近似技术的结合，以提高能效。

Method: 使用ROUP近似乘法器，通过分层、过滤和内核级方法分配，在ResNet-8模型和CIFAR-10数据集上评估。

Result: 实现54%的能效提升，仅损失4%准确率，优于现有DNN近似方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在能效和准确性之间取得了良好平衡，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

*Chao Zhou,Tom Jacobs,Advait Gadhikar,Rebekka Burkholz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出NANOADAM方法，通过动态更新小幅度权重来优化微调过程，减少资源消耗并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型预训练神经网络资源消耗高，现有方法通常限制参数更新范围。作者发现梯度与权重之间存在特定关联，小幅度权重常伴随大梯度，这启发了一种更高效的微调策略。

Method: 提出NANOADAM，动态更新小幅度权重。该方法无需梯度计算即可确定参数子集，保留大幅度权重以避免灾难性遗忘，并支持更大学习率。

Result: 在NLP和视觉任务中，NANOADAM表现出更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: NANOADAM通过选择性更新权重，有效减少资源消耗并提升微调效果。

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增强型时序感知图注意力网络（ATGAT），用于解决加密货币交易欺诈检测中的复杂模式和类别不平衡问题，性能显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币交易欺诈检测面临复杂交易模式和类别不平衡的双重挑战，传统方法难以捕捉交易网络的时序和结构依赖关系。

Method: ATGAT包含三个模块：多尺度时间差特征融合的时序嵌入模块、联合优化结构/时序/全局上下文注意力的三重注意力机制，以及加权BCE损失处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在Elliptic++数据集上，ATGAT的AUC达到0.9130，比XGBoost、GCN和标准GAT分别提升9.2%、12.0%和10.0%。

Conclusion: ATGAT验证了时序感知和多重注意力机制对图神经网络的增强效果，为金融机构提供了更可靠的欺诈检测工具，并可推广至其他时序图异常检测任务。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection
tasks.

*Jaris Küken,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过动态评估停止上下文学习的方法，以加速表格基础模型的推理，实验表明性能损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格基础模型在推理时成本较高，尤其是大数据集，需提高效率。

Method: 动态评估每层Transformer编码器后是否停止上下文学习，使用预训练的分层解码器解码嵌入。

Result: 在34个小分类任务中推理速度提升1.3倍，性能损失可忽略；在5个更大任务中速度提升2.2倍。

Conclusion: 早期退出是提高表格上下文学习效率的有效策略。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ScalaBL的可扩展贝叶斯低秩适应方法，通过随机变分子空间推理，解决了大语言模型（LLMs）不确定性量化的问题，同时减少了参数需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）存在幻觉和校准不足的问题，在高风险领域（如自主系统和医疗）中，量化其不确定性至关重要。现有方法因参数过多难以扩展。

Method: 在LoRA参数的r维子空间中进行贝叶斯推理，利用LoRA参数作为投影矩阵，将子空间样本映射到LLM的完整权重空间，使用随机变分推理学习所有参数。

Result: 尽管子空间维度低，但性能与现有最优方法相当，仅需约1000额外参数，并成功扩展至迄今最大的贝叶斯LLM，参数规模是先前工作的四倍。

Conclusion: ScalaBL是一种高效且可扩展的方法，适用于大语言模型的不确定性量化，显著减少了参数需求并保持了性能。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

Result: 在超光谱成像和天气预报任务中，D-CHAG实现了内存使用减少75%，并在1,024个AMD GPU上使持续吞吐量翻倍。

Conclusion: D-CHAG方法显著提升了多通道图像模态数据集的处理效率，为科学计算提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning
techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the
integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early
and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically,
Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of
modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native
speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic
optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration
using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Telangana地区女性对乳腺癌和宫颈癌的筛查率极低（2020年分别为0.3%和3.3%），且缺乏相关症状和筛查知识的认知，作者希望通过技术手段提高癌症意识和筛查率。

Method: 使用决策树分类和支持向量机分类算法分别预测宫颈癌和乳腺癌的易感性，并开发系统提供就近医院建议和健康记录管理。

Result: 通过模型预测和系统支持，能够为个体提供癌症易感性评估和医疗资源推荐，同时整合健康卡记录和开展宣传活动。

Conclusion: 该解决方案有助于提高Telangana地区的癌症意识和筛查率，从而降低死亡率并提升癌症知识普及。

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: mTSBench是一个用于多元时间序列异常检测（MTS-AD）和无监督模型选择的最大基准，涵盖19个数据集和12个应用领域，评估了24种异常检测方法，发现现有方法仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列异常检测在多个领域至关重要，但由于复杂的变量依赖关系、时间动态性和稀疏的异常标签，仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 引入mTSBench基准，评估24种异常检测方法，包括基于大语言模型（LLM）的检测器，并系统化比较无监督模型选择技术。

Result: 结果表明，没有单一检测器在所有数据集上表现优异，且现有模型选择方法仍远未达到最优。

Conclusion: mTSBench提供了一个统一的评估框架，促进未来自适应异常检测和鲁棒模型选择的研究。

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains
like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains
challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24
anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors
for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art
selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench
provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible
comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and
robust model selection.

### [227] [Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551)
*Ziyue Li,Chenrui Fan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大规模预训练模型（如7B参数的OLMoE）中，仍会出现“grokking”现象，即测试性能在训练损失收敛后持续提升。通过分析模型内部动态，揭示了从记忆到泛化的转换机制，并提出了两种新指标量化路径距离和复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索“grokking”现象在大规模预训练模型中的存在及其机制，以理解泛化和推理能力的涌现。

Method: 在7B参数的LLM（OLMoE）的单次预训练过程中，计算训练损失并评估其在数学推理、代码生成等任务上的泛化能力，同时分析模型内部动态。

Result: 验证了“grokking”现象在大规模预训练中仍存在，并发现样本路径从随机到结构化的演变，表明记忆到泛化的转换。新指标能预测泛化性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了“grokking”的机制，提出了实用的泛化监测指标，并证明了结构化路径能降低模型复杂度并提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个将脉冲神经网络（SNN）应用于合成孔径雷达（SAR）干涉相位解缠的理论框架，填补了现有方法的空白，并展示了SNN在能效上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着地球观测数据量的指数增长（如NISAR任务预计两年内生成100PB数据），能效处理对可持续数据中心运营至关重要。SNN的事件驱动计算模型相比传统方法可节省30-100倍能源。

Method: 开发了针对缠绕相位数据的脉冲编码方案，提出了利用相位解缠空间传播特性的SNN架构，并分析了计算复杂性和收敛性。

Result: SNN的时间动态特性可自然建模相位解缠的空间连续性约束，框架在保持精度的同时显著提升能效。

Conclusion: 该研究为神经形态计算与SAR干涉测量的交叉领域开辟了新方向，为大规模InSAR处理提供了可持续的补充方法。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural
networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase
unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive
literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase
unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth
observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like
NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing
becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their
event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x
compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We
develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data,
propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase
unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and
convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics
inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints
fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at
the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a
complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more
sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

TL;DR: 论文提出Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M)框架，利用人类大脑活动作为教师模型训练人工神经网络，提升学习效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑能以低维抽象表示高效编码感觉运动信息，且学习所需数据和计算资源远少于人工模型。

Method: 提出两种策略：Brain Contrastive Transfer（对比目标对齐脑活动与网络激活）和Brain Latent Transfer（监督回归脑特征投射潜在动态）。

Result: 实验表明，基于B2M的学生网络收敛更快且预测精度更高。

Conclusion: 大脑表征对人工学习具有重要价值，为高效学习复杂决策表示提供了新途径。

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances the training of novel sensory and decision models
by employing rich feature representations from large, pre-trained teacher
models. Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates
low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding.
Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer
data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We
introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural
activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model
for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1)
Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations
through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects
latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via
supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in
memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene
reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The
results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer
converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in
isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable
for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex
decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely
artificial training.

Result: 提出的SQS神经元模型结合了神经形态计算的时间序列高效性和量子计算的指数级大状态空间。

Conclusion: SQS神经网络模型为模块化、可扩展且可在量子硬件上训练的量子脉冲神经网络铺平了道路。

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising
paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary
strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing
time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,
consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,
leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are
exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these
paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models
have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron
implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring
repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use
conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we
propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these
challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a
spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic
spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS
neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a
hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global
classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series
efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state
space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks
that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

Abstract: The concurrent optimization of language models and instructional prompts
presents a significant challenge for deploying efficient and effective AI
systems, particularly when balancing performance against computational costs
like token usage. This paper introduces and assesses a bi-objective
evolutionary search engine designed to navigate this complex space, focusing
specifically on Small Language Models (SLMs). We employ the NSGA-II algorithm
and prompt grammar to simultaneously optimize for task accuracy and token
efficiency across some reasoning tasks. Our results successfully identify
diverse, high-performing model-prompt combinations, quantitatively revealing
the critical trade-off between the two objectives. This research highlights
task-specific affinities between particular SLMs and prompt structures (e.g.,
instructions, context, chain of thought). The generated practical Pareto fronts
offer decision-makers a portfolio of optimized solutions adaptable to their
specific constraints. This automated approach moves beyond traditional manual
tuning, providing a foundational framework for discovering effective human-AI
interaction patterns.

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis aims to control the style of generated speech
using reference input, which can be of various modalities. Existing face-based
methods struggle with robustness and generalization due to data quality
constraints, while text prompt methods offer limited diversity and fine-grained
control. Although multimodal approaches aim to integrate various modalities,
their reliance on fully matched training data significantly constrains their
performance and applicability. This paper proposes a 3-stage multimodal
controllable speech synthesis framework to address these challenges. For face
encoder, we use supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle
generalization issues. Furthermore, the text encoder is trained on both
text-face and text-speech data to enhance the diversity of the generated
speech. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms
single-modal baseline methods in both face based and text prompt based speech
synthesis, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality speech.

Abstract: This work introduces PeakNetFP, the first neural audio fingerprinting (AFP)
system designed specifically around spectral peaks. This novel system is
designed to leverage the sparse spectral coordinates typically computed by
traditional peak-based AFP methods. PeakNetFP performs hierarchical point
feature extraction techniques similar to the computer vision model PointNet++,

Abstract: Identifying instrument activities within audio excerpts is vital in music
information retrieval, with significant implications for music cataloging and
discovery. Prior deep learning endeavors in musical instrument recognition have
predominantly emphasized instrument classes with ample data availability.
Recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of hierarchical
classification in detecting instrument activities in orchestral music, even
with limited fine-grained annotations at the instrument level. Based on the
Hornbostel-Sachs classification, such a hierarchical classification system is
evaluated using the MedleyDB dataset, renowned for its diversity and richness
concerning various instruments and music genres. This work presents various
strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models and tests a new
class of models for hierarchical music prediction. This study showcases more
reliable coarse-level instrument detection by bridging the gap between detailed
instrument identification and group-level recognition, paving the way for

Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic
Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive
data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and
reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between
vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep
convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive
denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental
background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features,
which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the
intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information.
Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy
of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic
dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further
validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and
overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification
method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for
real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic
flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable
urban planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大规模音乐生成模型（如MusicGen和Mustango）计算成本高昂，适配器设计的选择多样但缺乏明确指导。本文旨在探索不同适配器配置在低资源音乐类型中的表现，以找到最优设计。

Method: 研究对比了卷积基和Transformer基适配器在MusicGen和Mustango模型上的表现，分析了它们在捕捉局部细节和长程依赖关系上的差异，并评估了不同规模适配器的计算资源需求。

Result: 卷积基适配器擅长捕捉局部音乐细节，而Transformer基适配器更适合长程依赖；中等规模适配器（40M参数）在表达力和质量间取得平衡。Mustango生成多样性高但稳定性差，计算成本高；MusicGen训练更快且质量更高，但生成冗余略多。

Conclusion: 适配器设计需根据具体音乐类型和需求选择，中等规模适配器是平衡点。Mustango适合多样性需求，MusicGen适合效率和稳定性。未来可进一步优化适配器设计以减少冗余和计算成本。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.

Conclusion: 可微分STFT为信号处理提供了一种高效、灵活的优化方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing
non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its
parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of
the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This
approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning
methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It
enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any
desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural
networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network
weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and
improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments
on both simulated and real-world data.

TL;DR: SmoothSinger是一种基于扩散模型的歌唱声音合成方法，通过统一框架直接优化低质量音频，减少失真，提升自然度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在歌唱声音合成中存在失真问题，且依赖两阶段流程。SmoothSinger旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用参考引导的双分支架构，结合低频上采样路径，直接优化低质量音频，避免两阶段流程的失真。

Result: 在Opencpop数据集上，SmoothSinger在客观和主观评估中均达到最佳效果，减少了失真并提升了自然度。

Conclusion: SmoothSinger通过统一框架和参考引导设计，显著提升了歌唱声音合成的质量和自然度。

Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality
vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and
articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in
image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to
the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in
artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a
conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural
singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage
and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized
audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated
with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch
architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference
to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware
synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel
low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch
contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during
training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,
addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments
on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that
SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective
evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing
artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.

with competing regions of attraction (ROAs). As a result, ROAs can have complex
"tentacle-like" morphologies that are challenging to characterize analytically
or computationally. In addition, the high dimensionality of the state space
prohibits the automated construction of Lyapunov functions using
state-of-the-art optimization methods, such as sum-of-squares (SOS)
programming. In this letter, we propose a distributed approach for the
construction of Lyapunov functions based solely on local information. To this
end, we establish an augmented comparison lemma that characterizes the
existence conditions of partial Lyapunov functions, while also accounting for
residual effects caused by the associated dimensionality reduction. These
theoretical results allow us to formulate an SOS optimization that iteratively
constructs such partial functions, whose aggregation forms a composite Lyapunov
function. The resulting composite function provides accurate convex
approximations of both the volumes and shapes of the ROAs. We validate our
method on networks of van der Pol and Ising oscillators, demonstrating its
effectiveness in characterizing high-dimensional systems with non-convex ROAs.

Conclusion: NTDPC框架通过噪声处理优化了预测控制的性能，适用于噪声环境下的高效预测。

Abstract: This paper focuses on a key challenge in hybrid data-driven predictive
control: the effect of measurement noise on Hankel matrices. While noise is
handled in direct and indirect methods, hybrid approaches often overlook its
impact during trajectory estimation. We propose a Noise-Tolerant Data-Driven
Predictive Control (NTDPC) framework that integrates singular value
decomposition to separate system dynamics from noise within reduced-order
Hankel matrices. This enables accurate prediction with shorter data horizons
and lower computational effort. A sensitivity index is introduced to support
horizon selection under different noise levels. Simulation results indicate
improved robustness and efficiency compared to existing hybrid methods.

TL;DR: DPLib是一个开源的MATLAB基准库，用于支持分布式和去中心化电力系统分析与优化的研究。它填补了现有工具的空白，提供了多区域测试案例和分区工具，并包含分布式最优潮流求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电力系统需要分布式方法以实现可扩展性、隐私保护和抗单点故障能力，但目前缺乏通用的分布式电力系统研究工具。

Method: DPLib提供超过20个多区域测试案例、基于图的分区工具，以及基于ADMM的分布式最优潮流求解器（包括DC-OPF和AC-OPF）。

Result: 生成的测试案例通过数值结果验证，为可重复的分布式电力系统研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: DPLib填补了分布式电力系统研究的工具空白，提供了标准化和易用的资源。

Abstract: \textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to
support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system
analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer
scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure,
making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike
centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data
library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib
fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20
multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based
partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple
electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB
code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with
region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular,
easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating
direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in
YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers
validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications.
Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a
foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.

Abstract: Satellite systems increasingly face operational risks from jamming,
cyberattacks, and electromagnetic disruptions. Traditional redundancy
strategies often fail against dynamic, multi-vector threats. This paper
introduces a resilience-by-design framework grounded in the PACE (Primary,
Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) methodology, originally developed for
tactical communications in military operations, adapting it to satellite
systems through a layered state-transition model informed by threat scoring
frameworks such as CVSS, DREAD, and NASA's risk matrix. We define a dynamic
resilience index to quantify system adaptability and implement three PACE
variants: static, adaptive, and softmax-based decision models, to evaluate
resilience under diverse disruption scenarios. The proposed approach highlights
the effectiveness of lightweight, decision-aware fallback mechanisms in
improving survivability and operational continuity for next-generation space
assets.

Abstract: The selection of optimal design for power electronic converter parameters
involves balancing efficiency and thermal constraints to ensure high
performance without compromising safety. This paper introduces a
probabilistic-learning-based stochastic surrogate modeling framework to address
this challenge and significantly reduce the time required during the design
phase. The approach begins with a neural network classifier that evaluates the
feasibility of parameter configurations, effectively filtering out unsafe
and/or impractical inputs. Subsequently, a probabilistic prediction model
estimates the converter's efficiency and temperature while quantifying
prediction uncertainty, providing both performance insights and reliability
metrics. Finally, a heuristic optimization-based model is employed to optimize
a multi-objective function that maximizes efficiency while adhering to thermal
constraints. The optimization process incorporates penalty terms to discourage
solutions that violate practical thresholds, ensuring actionable and realistic
recommendations. An advanced heuristic optimization method is used to find the
optimal solution and is compared with several well-known search algorithms,
including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated
Annealing (SA), Tabu-Search (TS), and Stochastic Hill Climbing (SHC). The
results demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy and
optimization outcomes, offering a robust solution for advancing power
electronics design.

Abstract: The effective and safe management of traffic is a key issue due to the rapid
advancement of the urban transportation system. Connected autonomous vehicles
(CAVs) possess the capability to connect with each other and adjacent
infrastructure, presenting novel opportunities for enhancing traffic flow and
coordination. This work proposes a dual-mode model predictive control (MPC)
architecture that tackles two interrelated issues: mitigating traffic density
at signalized junctions and facilitating seamless, cooperative lane changes in
high-density traffic conditions. The objective of this work is to facilitate
responsive decision-making for CAVs, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
safety of urban mobility. Moreover, we ensure recursive feasibility and
convergence of the proposed MPC scheme by the integration of an
online-calculated maximal control invariant terminal set. Finally, the efficacy
of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulation.

Conclusion: 该研究为LMICs电网的技术损耗问题提供了经济高效的解决方案，有助于提升电网的物理和经济强度。

Abstract: Electric grids in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across the world
face an acute challenge. To support global decarbonisation efforts and raise
millions from energy poverty, these grids must shoulder substantial load growth
while integrating distributed renewable generation. However, decades of rapid
and poorly funded infrastructure expansions have led to national grids in many
LMICs that are strained and weak, composed of aging, faulty, and undersized
infrastructure. A cause and symptom of this weakness is excessive technical
loss within the grid infrastructure during energy delivery, particularly at the
distribution level; network losses are regularly estimated to be well over 20
percent, compared to a baseline of 5 percent in higher-income nations.
Addressing technical loss through targeted interventions is essential for
bolstering grids' physical and economic strength. Unfortunately, current
approaches for estimating and localizing technical loss require expensive,
extensive power flow sensing, which is essentially absent in LMIC distribution
systems. We present a novel approach to technical loss estimation without power
flows, which leverages more readily available voltage magnitude measurements at
sparse locations in the grid. This estimator puts loss estimation and
localization within reach for LMIC grids globally, and provides a critical tool
for the effective design, implementation, and evaluation of loss-reduction
interventions.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该算法在多种场景下表现优于其他控制策略，接近理论上界。

Conclusion: 提出的近似算法在计算效率和性能上取得了平衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We study the joint scheduling of behind-the-meter distributed energy
resources (DERs), including flexible loads, renewable generation, and battery
energy storage systems, under net energy metering frameworks with demand
charges. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program aimed at
maximizing expected operational surplus while accounting for renewable
generation uncertainty. We analytically characterize the structure of the
optimal control policy and show that it admits a threshold-based form. However,
due to the strong temporal coupling of the storage and demand charge
constraints, the number of conditional branches in the policy scales
combinatorially with the scheduling horizon, as it requires a look-ahead over
future states. To overcome the high computational complexity in the general
formulation, an efficient approximation algorithm is proposed, which searches
for the peak demand under a mildly relaxed problem. We show that the algorithm
scales linearly with the scheduling horizon. Extensive simulations using two
open-source datasets validate the proposed algorithm and compare its
performance against different DER control strategies, including a reinforcement
learning-based one. Under varying storage and tariff parameters, the results
show that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmarks in achieving a
relatively small solution gap compared to the theoretical upper bound.
