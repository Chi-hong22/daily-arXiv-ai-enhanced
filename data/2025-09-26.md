### [1] [Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379)
*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的下一词概率（NTP）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来高效识别VLM生成的文本与视觉内容之间的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM产生的幻觉（文本与视觉内容不匹配）降低了模型的可靠性。现有的检测方法通常使用VLM自身或其他模型评估生成输出，计算量大且增加延迟。

Method: 利用VLM的下一词概率（NTP）作为模型不确定性的量化指标，训练传统ML模型进行幻觉检测。还引入了语言NTP和VLM幻觉预测分数来增强检测性能。

Result: NTP特征能有效预测幻觉，使轻量级ML模型达到与强VLM相当的性能。结合语言NTP和VLM预测分数可进一步提升检测效果。

Conclusion: 基于NTP的轻量级方法为提升VLM可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案，有望推动更高效的幻觉检测技术发展。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于解决离线手写签名验证在独立作者设置下的泛化问题，通过SPD矩阵空间生成合成数据来训练分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在独立作者设置下具有挑战性，现有方法依赖真实数据集训练分类器，但真实数据获取困难且成本高。

Method: 利用SPD矩阵的黎曼几何特性，通过黎曼高斯混合模型识别黎曼中心作为合成作者，方差作为其属性，生成正负样本的合成SPD群体，采用度量学习框架处理相似和不相似SPD点对。

Result: 在两个包含西方和亚洲书写风格的流行签名数据集上的实验表明，该方法在数据集内和跨数据集评估协议下均取得低错误率。

Conclusion: 准合成方法在黎曼空间中生成合成数据对于独立作者签名验证系统具有潜力，能够有效降低错误率并提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，集成了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，采用高效的扩散变换器和优化的VAE，能够快速生成高分辨率图像，并在多项任务上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像系统功能单一，无法满足复杂的图像编辑和组合需求。Seedream 4.0旨在开发一个统一框架，将多种图像生成任务整合，提供更交互式和多维度的创作工具。

Method: 开发高效的扩散变换器配合强大的VAE，显著减少图像令牌数量；通过数十亿文本-图像对进行预训练；采用多模态后训练联合训练T2I和图像编辑任务；集成对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码等技术加速推理。

Result: 生成2K图像推理时间最快达1.8秒；在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平；在复杂任务中展示出色的多模态能力，包括精确图像编辑和上下文推理；支持多图像参考和生成多张输出图像。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统T2I系统扩展为更交互式和多维度的创作工具，推动了生成AI在创意和专业应用领域的边界，现已可通过指定链接访问。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的乳腺癌检测框架，能够在小型标注数据集上实现高性能，在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上达到96.7%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测对治疗结果至关重要。虽然深度学习在计算机辅助检测系统中显示出潜力，但由于标注数据有限，其准确性往往受限。

Method: 采用半监督对比学习方法，使用Resnet-50模型在大规模未标注乳腺X光片数据上进行训练，通过相似性指数和各种数据增强技术提升性能，最后在小规模标注数据上进行微调。

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的检测准确率，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架能够有效解决深度学习在医学图像分析中数据标注不足的问题，为乳腺癌早期检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

### [5] [Are Foundation Models Ready for Industrial Defect Recognition? A Reality Check on Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20479)
*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文测试了多个基础模型在工业图像质量检测中的应用，发现这些模型在公开数据集上表现良好，但在真实工业数据上全部失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在文本和图像处理任务中表现出色，具有零样本泛化能力，可能适用于系列制造中的自动化质量检测，以替代繁琐的标注任务。

Method: 在定制真实工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个最新基础模型，比较它们在两种数据上的表现。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上都失败了，而相同的模型在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在工业质量检测中的直接应用存在局限性，需要针对工业场景进行专门优化。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

### [6] [Shared Neural Space: Unified Precomputed Feature Encoding for Multi-Task and Cross Domain Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20481)
*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的神经空间（NS）框架，通过编码器-解码器结构预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，使多个下游AI模块能够共享相同的特征空间，从而提高效率并改善跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型通常针对特定高精度任务定制，这在处理一系列模块化任务时效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，学习变换感知、可泛化的表示，使多个下游模块能在共享特征空间中运行。

Result: 实验表明，成像和视觉模块（如去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割）可以在神经空间中高效执行。

Conclusion: 该架构减少了冗余，改善了跨域偏移的泛化能力，并为高效的多任务视觉管道奠定了基础，相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量且硬件适应性更广。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

*Dani Manjah,Tim Bary,Benoît Gérin,Benoît Macq,Christophe de Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合高置信度流式策略和多样性方法的选择策略，用于在边缘摄像头系统中高效选择训练图像，以最大化模型质量并降低传输成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘摄像头系统需要定期更新模型以适应不断变化的环境，但边缘设备计算能力有限，需要从中央服务器获取标注数据来训练小型模型。如何选择最有用的训练图像以在保持低传输成本的同时最大化模型质量是一个关键问题。

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略与多样性方法相结合的选择策略，通过最小化数据集查询来优化训练图像选择过程。

Result: 在相似的训练负载下，该方法能够产生高质量的模型，同时显著减少数据集查询次数。

Conclusion: 高置信度流式策略与多样性方法的结合是在边缘摄像头系统中高效选择训练图像的有效方案，能够在保持模型质量的同时降低传输成本。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言指导实现细粒度和复杂的样式控制，支持单件或多件服装的试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法存在局限性：生成理想结果的掩码困难、需要背景知识、可能模型依赖，且在某些情况下无法实现（如将长袖衬衫的袖子卷起）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本样式指令，无需精确绘制掩码，并可自动执行多轮图像生成。

Result: InstructVTON与现有虚拟试穿模型互操作，实现了具有样式控制的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了终端用户体验，解决了基于掩码的虚拟试穿模型的局限性，提供了更灵活和强大的虚拟试穿能力。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个深度学习模型，用于识别被篡改的指纹，在SOCOFing数据集上对三个难度级别分别达到96.7%、98.76%和99.54%的准确率，但阈值选择对性能影响很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边境管控、法医和财政准入等应用中，指纹识别面临被故意修改以逃避检测的挑战，需要开发能够识别篡改指纹的鲁棒系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered子集上评估三个难度级别。

Result: 在严格阈值下，三个难度级别的准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%；但当阈值从0.92放松到0.72时，准确率急剧下降到7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明其已准备好用于需要安全性和识别弹性的实际部署，但阈值选择在生物识别系统中至关重要。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: 探索如何利用预训练视觉模型的注意力机制来增强机器人操作的语义理解能力，特别是在复杂的双手操作任务中。

Method: 从自监督ViT模型DINOv2提取注意力图，将其解释为RGB图像的像素级显著性分数，然后将这些图提升到3D体素网格中，生成体素级语义线索，并整合到最先进的基于体素的行为克隆策略中。

Result: 在RLBench双手基准测试的所有任务中，注意力引导的特征化方法平均绝对改进达到8.2%，相对增益为21.9%。

Conclusion: 将预训练视觉Transformer的注意力图集成到体素表示中是增强机器人操作性能的有效方法，特别是在双手操作场景中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文对YOLO和RT-DETR系列共36个实时目标检测模型在蓝莓检测任务上进行了基准测试，使用包含85,879个标注实例的新数据集，并通过半监督学习进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然环境中蓝莓检测面临光照变化、遮挡和运动模糊等挑战，需要大规模多样化数据集和合适的精度/速度权衡模型。

Method: 使用新构建的蓝莓数据集评估YOLO(v8-v12)和RT-DETR(v1-v2)系列模型，并采用无偏均值教师半监督学习方法在1,035张未标注图像上进行微调。

Result: YOLOv12m达到93.3% mAP@50，RT-DETRv2-X达到93.6% mAP@50；半监督学习后RT-DETR-v2-X达到最佳94.8% mAP@50。中等规模模型在精度和速度间取得较好平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为蓝莓检测提供了全面的基准分析，数据集和代码已公开。半监督学习能提升性能，但需要进一步研究以更好地利用跨域未标注数据。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的ROI增强策略，通过在训练时概率性地用随机ROI裁剪替换完整图像，来提升乳腺X光片分类性能，而无需额外标签或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光片筛查对早期检测和降低死亡率至关重要，但深度学习在自动化解读方面受限于低分辨率数据集和小样本量。

Method: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上引入训练时的ROI增强策略：概率性地用预计算的、无标签边界框库中的随机ROI裁剪替换完整图像，可选抖动增加变异性。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM上，ROI增强（最佳参数：p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10）带来适度的平均ROC-AUC提升，但性能在不同折叠间有变化；PR-AUC持平或略低。

Conclusion: 简单的、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在受限环境下增强乳腺X光片分类，且不影响推理时间成本。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

TL;DR: 利用单张图像中的镜面反射作为辅助视图，构建物理有效的虚拟相机，实现单图像多视角立体视觉，简化3D重建过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常环境中镜面反射常见，能提供立体信息。通过将反射视为辅助视图，可以利用单张图像实现多视角立体视觉，简化成像过程。

Method: 设计变换构建物理有效的虚拟相机，直接生成像素域虚拟视图；提出对称感知损失优化姿态估计；框架可扩展到动态场景。

Result: 创建包含16个Blender场景的合成数据集进行定量评估，在真实和合成数据上的实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张包含镜面反射的图像实现鲁棒的3D重建，简化了传统多视角立体视觉的复杂成像过程。

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: FacadeTrack是一个街景级别的语言引导框架，用于灾后建筑占用评估，通过链接全景视频与地块、校正立面视图并提取可解释属性，提供透明且可扩展的占用评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后建筑占用评估对分类、检查、公用事业恢复和资源分配至关重要。高空图像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景图像细节丰富但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 提出FacadeTrack框架：链接全景视频与地块，校正立面视图，提取可解释属性（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用两种决策策略：透明的一阶段规则和将感知与保守推理分离的两阶段设计。

Result: 在两次飓风Helene灾后调查中评估，两阶段方法达到精确率0.927、召回率0.781、F-1分数0.848；一阶段基线为精确率0.943、召回率0.728、F-1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示错误来源。

Conclusion: 该管道提供可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流中，通过属性分析和诊断实现有针对性的质量控制。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨人类如何通过语义表征来补充视觉特征识别社会互动，发现语义模型（特别是基于动词的嵌入）能最好地解释人类相似性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从简单的运动形状中识别各种社会互动，但以往研究多关注视觉特征，本研究旨在探究人类使用哪些语义表征来补充视觉特征。

Method: 研究1让参与者直接标记动画印象；研究2通过人类相似性判断测量27种社会互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和动画描述语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 语义模型为解释人类判断提供了对视觉特征的补充信息，其中基于描述的动词嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社会感知反映了社会互动的语义结构，连接了视觉和抽象表征。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Motivation: 现有方法在严重的外观变化下缺乏鲁棒性，难以处理无人机不同方向和视野导致的跨域泛化问题，且需要同时捕捉全局语义和局部细节的可靠对应关系。

Method: 使用E(2)-Steerable CNN编码器提取旋转和视角变化下的稳定特征，构建带虚拟超级节点的图结构实现全局语义聚合和局部区域重分配，确保全局-局部一致性。

Conclusion: EGS框架通过结合几何感知特征提取和全局-局部图结构，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的鲁棒性和对应关系建立问题，具有优异的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: 提出的双路径边缘网络通过互补的处理路径有效解决了红外小目标检测中的特征对齐问题，实现了精确的目标检测和定位。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Motivation: 传统意图识别主要关注个体意图，忽略了群体环境中集体意图的复杂性。为了解决这一局限，需要研究群体意图的识别和预测。

Method: 提出了SHOT数据集(包含1,979个篮球视频片段，5个摄像机视角，6种个体属性标注)和GIFT框架(提取细粒度个体特征并建模动态群体互动)。

Result: 实验结果表明SHOT数据集和GIFT框架的有效性，为群体意图预测研究奠定了坚实基础。

Conclusion: 该研究开创了群体意图预测的新方向，通过多视角、多层次的群体动态建模，能够有效预测群体共享目标的出现时机。

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 海事目标检测面临两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺以及在不同海事属性（如目标类别、视角、位置和成像环境）上的泛化能力差。现有数据集训练的模型在代表性不足的场景（如开阔海域环境）中表现不佳。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的陨石坑导航技术主要针对短时、高频率的着陆任务，而长期月球测绘任务面临稀疏、倾斜图像和变化光照条件的挑战，需要开发新的导航解决方案。

Method: STELLA结合了基于Mask R-CNN的陨石坑检测器、无描述符的陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视n点姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端。

Result: 在CRESENT-365数据集上的实验表明，STELLA在各种视角、光照条件和月球纬度下平均保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务提供了操作条件的参考。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

TL;DR: 研究发现，仅视觉和仅语言模型在各自网络的中后层产生部分对齐的表征空间，这种对齐基于语义而非表面特征，且与人类在多对多图像-文本匹配中的偏好一致。通过聚合示例可以增强对齐效果。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索跨模态模型在表征空间中对齐的具体机制，包括对齐出现的网络层次、支持的视觉或语言线索、是否反映人类在多对多图像-文本场景中的偏好，以及示例聚合对对齐的影响。

Method: 系统研究视觉和语言模型在不同网络层次的对齐情况，测试对表面变化和语义变化的鲁棒性，设计强制选择的"Pick-a-Pic"任务评估人类偏好与模型对齐的一致性，并研究示例聚合对对齐的影响。

Result: 对齐在两种模型的中后层达到峰值；对齐对仅外观变化鲁棒，但对语义变化（如物体移除或词序打乱）敏感；人类在多对多图像-文本匹配中的偏好与模型嵌入空间的对齐一致；示例聚合能增强而非模糊对齐。

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于一个共享的语义代码，该代码与人类判断一致，并通过示例聚合得到加强。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Conclusion: FreeInsert框架有效解决了对象插入中的几何控制和风格一致性问题，无需额外训练即可实现高质量的个性化图像编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

Abstract: With the increasing use of neural network (NN)-based computer vision
applications that process image and video data as input, interest has emerged
in video compression technology optimized for computer vision tasks. In fact,

platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DAC-LoRA框架，将对抗训练集成到参数高效微调中，通过动态对抗课程提升视觉语言模型的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在关键应用中易受对抗攻击，而现有的参数高效微调方法无法有效应对这些安全威胁，CLIP等基础模型的漏洞会波及整个多模态AI生态系统

Method: 基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES启发式损失，构建渐进式挑战攻击的智能课程，将对抗训练融入标准PEFT流程

Result: 在保持清洁准确性的同时，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA是一种有效、轻量且广泛适用的方法，可轻松集成到标准PEFL流程中显著增强鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedDSPG的新方法，从生成视角解决联邦领域泛化问题，通过生成领域特定软提示来提升模型在未知领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的联邦领域泛化方法学习的软提示多样性有限，且容易忽略未知领域的信息，需要一种更有效的方法来处理领域偏移问题。

Method: FedDSPG方法在训练阶段为每个领域引入领域特定软提示，将内容和领域知识整合到客户端间的生成模型中；在推理阶段使用生成器获取未见目标领域的软提示来指导下游任务。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的全面评估表明，该方法在联邦领域泛化任务中优于现有强基线，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 从生成视角提出的FedDSPG方法能有效处理联邦学习中的领域泛化问题，通过生成领域特定软提示显著提升了模型在未知领域的适应能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: PoisonVID是针对视频大语言模型(VideoLLMs)中提示引导采样策略的首个黑盒中毒攻击，通过闭环优化策略破坏采样机制，攻击成功率高达82%-99%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然早期帧采样策略已被发现存在漏洞，但提示引导采样策略的安全性尚未被探索，本文旨在填补这一研究空白

Method: 采用闭环优化策略，通过基于影子VideoLLM和GPT-4o-mini构建的改写有害描述集，迭代优化通用扰动来抑制有害帧的相关性分数

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLM上的综合评估显示，PoisonVID攻击成功率达到82%-99%

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了提示引导采样策略的安全漏洞，强调了为VideoLLMs开发未来先进采样策略的重要性

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GoR的自适应正则化方法，用于平衡量化感知训练中的任务特定损失和知识蒸馏损失，解决了低比特量化下梯度冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化条件下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，存在梯度幅度异质性问题。

Method: GoR方法使用仅两个可训练参数进行动态损失加权，自适应平衡TS和KD目标，并引入了QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和LLM压缩任务上，GoR均优于现有QAT-KD方法，在边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率。

Conclusion: GoR为资源受限硬件上的AI模型压缩提供了鲁棒解决方案，在最优条件下甚至可以超越全精度模型性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Motivation: 评估大规模网络收集的含标签错误的噪声训练数据集能否与专家验证的小型高质量数据集竞争，以解决植物物种图像数据不足的问题

Method: 使用两个训练数据集（网络收集的噪声数据集和专家验证的清洁数据集）在Pl@ntNet移动应用收集的测试集上进行植物识别性能对比评估

Result: 挑战赛结果显示大规模噪声数据集在某些情况下可以与传统清洁数据集竞争，但具体结果需要进一步分析

Conclusion: 网络来源的噪声数据可以作为植物识别系统的重要补充资源，但需要开发更有效的噪声处理方法来提升识别性能

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特定计数转向跨物种计数，通过结合局部计数思想和提取-匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度、跨物种植物计数方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统植物计数方法需要为每个物种构建特定模型，但植物种类繁多且不断有新物种出现，这种方法不可持续。受计算机视觉中类别无关计数(CAC)的启发，需要重新思考植物计数的问题定义。

Method: TasselNetV4继承TasselNet的局部计数思想，结合CAC的提取-匹配范式，基于普通视觉transformer构建，并引入多分支框感知局部计数器来增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia两个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，TasselNetV4不仅实现了优越的计数性能，而且具有高效率。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4有望成为跨场景、跨尺度、跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

<details>

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在视网膜OCT图像分割中经常产生解剖学不合理的分割结果，无法有效建模层与病变之间的相互作用，且缺乏拓扑正确性保证。

Method: 引入完全可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，实现层与病变的双向影响联合学习，利用未标记和部分标记数据集，学习解耦的空间和风格因子表示。

Result: 在公共和内部OCT数据集上的评估显示，该方法在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，并能使用部分标注数据将层分割泛化到病理病例。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在半监督学习中应用解剖约束的潜力，能够实现准确、鲁棒且可信的视网膜生物标志物分割。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法使用大型语言模型作为知识引擎，但图像描述通常包含与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs对VQA任务理解有限，限制了推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型生成图像描述，通过上下文示例生成、总结和重排描述来排除无关信息，增强LLMs对图像和问题的理解。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过改进的图像描述处理机制有效提升了LLMs在知识型VQA任务中的性能，证明了无需端到端训练即可增强模型推理能力。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文揭示了感知优化与评估之间的不对称性：在图像质量评估中表现优秀的保真度指标不一定适用于感知优化，这种不匹配在对抗训练中尤为明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化目标（保真度目标和对抗目标）作为优化目标的有效性与它们作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过系统分析，比较不同保真度指标在感知优化中的表现，并研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响。

Result: 发现保真度指标在IQA和优化中的效果存在不对称性；判别器设计对优化结果具有决定性影响，其中补丁级和卷积架构比传统或基于Transformer的替代方案提供更忠实的细节重建。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可转移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出IOG-VQA模型，通过集成物体交互自注意力机制和基于GAN的去偏技术，解决VQA任务中的数据偏见问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型容易受到训练数据偏见的影响，过度依赖表面模式，难以泛化到多样化的问答场景。需要同时处理物体交互理解和数据偏见问题。

Method: IOG-VQA模型包含两个核心组件：物体交互自注意力机制（捕捉图像中物体间的复杂交互关系）和基于GAN的去偏框架（生成无偏见的数据分布）。

Result: 在VQA-CP v1和VQA-CP v2数据集上的实验表明，该模型在存在偏见和不平衡数据分布的情况下表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 同时处理物体交互和数据偏见对于推进VQA任务至关重要，IOG-VQA模型为这一方向提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频序列中的结构化噪声和背景伪影会掩盖动态内容，传统RPCA方法的稀疏性假设难以捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变异性。

Method: 整合低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，通过核范数约束和扩散模型先验进行视频分解和恢复。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA方法，在对比度增强（gCNR）和信号保真度（KS统计量）方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型与深度生成先验的方法在高保真视频恢复方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出FerretNet，一种轻量级神经网络，通过分析生成过程中引入的潜在分布偏差和解码诱导平滑效应来检测合成图像，在22个生成模型的开放世界基准上达到97.1%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VAEs、GANs和LDMs等先进模型生成的合成图像越来越逼真，合成图像检测面临重大挑战。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖特性，重建合成图像以暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏。基于此提出FerretNet，一个仅110万参数的轻量级神经网络。

Result: FerretNet仅在4类ProGAN数据集上训练，在包含22个生成模型的开放世界基准上达到97.1%的平均准确率，比现有最优方法高出10.6%。

Conclusion: FerretNet提供了一种高效且鲁棒的合成图像检测方法，在跨模型检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF是一个基于概念瓶颈模型的可解释视频分类框架，通过处理视频中的时间依赖性来捕捉动作和事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，难以处理视频数据中的时间依赖性，而时间依赖性对于捕捉动作和事件至关重要。

Method: MoTIF采用类似transformer的架构设计，能够处理任意长度的视频序列，通过全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性三个互补视角来分析视频概念。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于概念建模的范式可以有效地迁移到视频数据，在保持竞争力的同时更好地理解时间上下文中的概念贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈框架扩展到视频分类领域，为视频理解提供了更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) addresses the challenge of
detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated
data. In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework
named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在远距离物体监测或计算资源受限的任务中，传统的密集深度估计和3D场景重建方法不可行，需要一种更高效的3D定位解决方案。

Method: 使用粒子滤波器进行单目标和多目标场景的3D定位，结合相机位姿估计和图像分割结果，方法独立于检测技术。

Result: 通过3D仿真和基于无人机的图像分割序列测试，证明粒子滤波器能够在其他方法失效的情况下有效解决实际定位任务。

Conclusion: 粒子滤波器为无人机野火监测等安全关键任务提供了可行的3D定位解决方案，具有灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SwinMamba框架，结合局部Mamba扫描和全局感受野，用于遥感图像语义分割，在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割面临高空间分辨率、复杂场景结构和多样物体尺度的挑战。Vision Mamba虽具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但依赖全局扫描会忽略关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘）。

Method: 受Swin Transformer启发，SwinMamba在移位窗口内集成局部Mamba风格扫描与全局感受野。前两个阶段执行局部扫描捕获细粒度细节，后两个阶段利用全局扫描融合更广泛的上下文信息。使用重叠移位窗口增强区域间信息交换。

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的广泛实验表明，SwinMamba优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SwinMamba展示了其作为遥感图像语义分割优越解决方案的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于pack的MIL框架，通过将可变长度的特征序列打包成固定长度序列来解决计算病理学中WSI序列长度极端变化的问题，同时引入残差分支和注意力驱动下采样器来减少特征损失和冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的WSI具有极长的序列长度（高达200K）、显著的长度变化（200到200K）和有限的监督，导致数据异质性和冗余度高。传统方法在有限监督下难以有效处理这种异质性。

Method: 1) pack-based MIL框架：将采样的可变长度特征序列打包成固定长度序列，实现批处理训练；2) 残差分支：将多个幻灯片丢弃的特征组合成超幻灯片进行训练；3) 注意力驱动下采样器：压缩特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上，准确率提升高达8%，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 专注于解决计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力，该方法有效解决了WSI序列长度极端变化带来的训练效率和数据异质性难题。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

TL;DR: SimDiff是一种模拟器约束的扩散模型，通过将环境参数直接集成到去噪过程中，无需在推理时重复调用模拟器即可高效生成物理合理的人类运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将基于模拟器的运动投影层纳入扩散过程以确保物理合理性，但由于模拟器的顺序性质，这些方法计算成本高昂且无法并行化。

Method: 将模拟器运动投影解释为扩散过程中的一种引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过条件化环境参数（如重力、风力）直接在去噪过程中生成物理合理的运动。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理合理的运动，无需推理时重复模拟器调用，并提供对不同物理系数的细粒度控制，同时成功泛化到未见过的环境参数组合。

Conclusion: SimDiff通过将环境参数直接集成到扩散过程中，实现了物理合理运动的高效生成和组合泛化能力，为角色动画和虚拟现实应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Motivation: 视觉模型的鲁棒性通常被测量，但其对特定架构设计选择的依赖性很少被剖析。本研究旨在理解为什么某些视觉架构对高斯噪声具有固有鲁棒性。

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别出四个一致的鲁棒性设计模式，并通过理论分析解释这些发现。

Result: 发现四个关键设计模式能带来高达506位的排名提升和21.6%的准确率增益，并提供了理论证明和机制解释。

Conclusion: 研究结果将鲁棒性分解为可解释的模块，提供了理论解释，并建立了实用的即插即用设计指南，用于构建对高斯噪声更鲁棒的视觉模型。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASD是一个适配器，能够在无需任何预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型的前提下，实现自监督学习（SSL）的冷启动，用于深度图像聚类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的将SSL技术集成到深度聚类框架中的方法都需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为前提条件，这限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活性和开箱即用的应用。

Method: 1. 从所有未标记数据中随机采样伪标记数据，并设置实例级分类器学习这些带有语义对齐实例级标签的数据；2. 利用实例级分类能力，跟踪未标记数据预测的类别转换，提取实例级类别的高层相似性，用于为伪标记数据分配聚类级标签；3. 使用带有聚类级标签的伪标记数据触发在未标记数据上训练的通用SSL学习器进行图像聚类。

Result: ASD在各种基准测试中表现出优于最新深度图像聚类方法的性能，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比仅有很小的准确率差距（例如在CIFAR-10上仅为1.33%）。此外，ASD还能进一步提升现有集成SSL的深度图像聚类方法的性能。

Conclusion: ASD提供了一种无需任何前提条件的SSL冷启动解决方案，显著提高了深度图像聚类的灵活性和实用性，同时保持了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers会产生高范数伪影，在知识蒸馏时这些伪影会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽略信息信号，限制了大型模型的增益

Method: 使用零空间引导的扰动进行教师特征精炼，通过LoRA适配器实现高效扰动，在精炼过程中抑制伪影同时保留信息，然后将精炼后的教师特征蒸馏给学生模型

Result: 在多个下游任务中实现最先进性能，产生更清晰和可解释的表征

Conclusion: SiNGER框架能有效解决伪影抑制和信息保留之间的权衡问题，显著提升学生模型性能

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Result: 在Sentinel-2和Landsat 8数据集上的评估显示，该方法在不同输入配置下都能实现准确的云分割。

Conclusion: Fast-SEnSeI为星载云分割提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于多种多光谱传感器。

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Conclusion: SNCE方法通过单神经元操纵实现了精确的概念擦除，在安全性和图像质量保持方面显著优于现有方法

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物器官点云分割方法通常针对特定植物物种或传感器，且需要大量预处理和降采样，限制了应用范围。

Method: 开发KDSS算法，这是一种轻量级的下采样方法，能够保持分辨率，无需对输入数据进行降采样。

Result: 结合当前最先进的分割模型，KDSS在不同传感器（如摄影测量、激光三角测量和LiDAR）和多种植物物种上均表现出令人满意的结果。

Conclusion: KDSS是一种轻量级、保持分辨率的替代方案，适用于植物器官分割，不受物种和传感器类型的限制。

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: Mambo是一个新的前景-背景分解框架，用于解决少样本分布外检测中现有方法对局部类别相似性过度依赖和固定背景补丁提取策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前景-背景分解方法在少样本分布外检测中往往因过度依赖局部类别相似性和固定的背景补丁提取策略而缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出学习背景提示来获取包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性，然后使用局部类别相似性来细化局部背景相似性。同时提出补丁自校准调优来灵活选择不同样本的背景补丁数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，Mambo在分布外检测和近分布外检测设置方面相比最先进方法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo通过结合细化的局部背景相似性和局部类别相似性进行背景提取，减少了先前方法对局部类别相似性的依赖，并通过灵活的补丁选择策略解决了固定背景提取的问题。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at
https://github.com/YuzunoKawori/Mambo.

TL;DR: 提出两种图像分割数据集划分方法：IPS（迭代像素分层）和WDES（Wasserstein驱动的进化分层），解决随机划分导致的测试集不具代表性和模型评估偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集不具代表性，造成评估偏差和模型泛化能力差。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但分割任务的多标签结构和类别不平衡使其难以应用。

Method: 1. IPS：基于标签感知的简单采样方法；2. WDES：新颖的遗传算法，通过最小化Wasserstein距离优化分割间的标签分布相似性，证明在足够代数下具有全局最优性。

Result: 使用新的统计异质性指标评估，WDES相比随机采样能产生更具代表性的划分。在街景、医学影像、卫星图像等任务中，WDES降低了性能方差并改善了模型评估，特别适用于小规模、不平衡和低多样性数据集。

Conclusion: WDES方法能有效解决分割数据集划分的偏差问题，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现优异，为分割模型的可靠评估提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

TL;DR: 本文研究了对抗性补丁从卷积神经网络(CNN)到视觉变换器(ViT)的可迁移性，发现ViT模型对对抗性攻击存在显著脆弱性，攻击成功率在不同模型间差异很大(40.04%-99.97%)，预训练数据集规模和方法强烈影响模型对抗攻击的韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统的广泛应用，其安全性成为关键问题。尽管ViT在性能和对抗扰动鲁棒性方面优于CNN，但仍存在被对抗性补丁攻击的漏洞，需要研究跨架构的攻击可迁移性。

Method: 使用Creases Transformation(CT)技术设计现实的对抗性补丁，在人物与非人物分类任务中测试四个微调的ViT模型，评估CNN对抗攻击技术在ViT分类模型上的可迁移性。

Result: 实验显示ViT模型对对抗性补丁攻击存在显著脆弱性差异：google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k攻击成功率为40.04%，facebook/dino-vitb16达到99.97%，其他两个模型分别为66.40%和65.17%。

Conclusion: 证实了对抗性补丁从CNN到ViT的跨架构可迁移性，预训练数据集规模和方法是影响模型对抗攻击韧性的关键因素。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频概念迁移方法缺乏对视频不同组件的细粒度控制能力，难以实现精确可控的生成效果。

Method: 采用空间分解（前景主体、背景、运动流）和时间步分解（Chain-of-Prompt机制），结合双到单流DiT架构和自监督预训练策略。

Result: 在OpenAnimal数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度和可编辑性方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过空间和时间分解实现了高质量可控的视频概念迁移，为视频编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖LLM推理来分析解析后的视觉内容，但受限于静态感知阶段，无法实现人类级别的感知和理解。

Method: VTTS采用迭代感知机制，结合强化学习和时空监督来优化推理过程，逐步聚焦高置信度的时空区域。

Result: 实验表明VTTS在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，Videochat-R1.5模型相比Qwen2.5VL-3B和-7B等基线模型平均提升超过5%。

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效增强了MLLMs的推理能力，在视频对话、视频推理和时空感知等任务中表现出优异的泛化性能。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal

Motivation: 理解深度学习模型学习的内容对于AI在临床环境中的安全部署至关重要。现有研究主要关注像素级可解释性方法，较少关注模型学习的文本概念，而这些概念可能更好地反映临床医生的推理过程。

Method: 利用乳腺X光片特定的视觉语言模型(Mammo-CLIP)作为"解剖器"，在指定层为神经元标注人类可解释的文本概念，并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。

Result: 乳腺X光片数据训练的模型比通用图像数据训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念，且与放射科医生工作流程更一致。任务特定的微调增强了某些概念类别(如良性钙化)的捕获，但可能减少其他类别(如密度特征)的覆盖。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect提供了卷积神经网络如何捕获乳腺X光片特定知识的见解，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即中间推理过程与视频动态不符，即使最终答案正确，也削弱了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MOSS-ChatV强化学习框架，使用基于动态时间规整(DTW)的规则化过程奖励，将推理轨迹与时间基础参考对齐，无需辅助奖励模型即可实现高效的过程监督。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上表现提升，并在不同架构(Qwen2.5-VL、Phi-2)上均获得一致增益。GPT-4o评估显示其产生更一致稳定的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了视频推理中的过程不一致问题，具有广泛的适用性，为多模态大语言模型的视频推理能力提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Result: 大量实验验证，该方法大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一运动表示方法能有效生成符合相机轨迹且保持物体运动一致性的视频。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成图像与真实图像的界限日益模糊，这引发了生成器与判别器之间的竞争。本文旨在探究判别器在何种条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量标准，分析数据维度和复杂度对判别器检测能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现：简单数据集和高度复杂数据集都会降低合成图像的可检测性；而中等复杂度数据集为检测创造了最有利条件，因为生成器无法完全捕捉数据分布，其错误仍然可见。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测具有非线性影响，中等复杂度数据集最有利于判别器发挥作用，这为理解生成器与判别器竞争提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Motivation: 为了解决传统CLIP模型在不同分辨率下需要重新训练或部署多个模型的问题，实现单一模型支持多分辨率推理并动态优化计算效率。

Result: 在零样本分类任务中表现出色，仅需轻量级蒸馏训练，就能在保持竞争力的准确率同时显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP提供了一种高效的自适应分辨率推理方案，用户可以通过单一部署模型动态选择计算精度权衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Motivation: 当前对CLIP模型量化的研究主要关注精度影响，而忽略了量化对可靠性指标（如校准性和OOD检测）的影响，这对于CLIP的高效可靠部署至关重要。

Method: 对CLIP模型进行大规模量化评估，不仅评估分布内精度，还评估包括校准性、OOD检测在内的全面可靠性指标，并分析不同预训练来源的影响。

Result: 量化能持续改善通常欠自信预训练模型的校准性，但会降低过自信变体的校准性；即使校准性下降，OOD检测性能仍可能提升；某些QAT方法能同时提升零样本精度、校准性和OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 量化在CLIP模型部署中具有超越传统效率-性能权衡的作用，为构建高效、可靠、鲁棒的视觉语言模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万个示例，覆盖20个任务，基于200万个独特表格，其中88%保留了原始可视化。该数据集提供图像-HTML配对表示，支持视觉语言模型的训练和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解主要依赖像素级处理，但现有基准多使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性。现有VTU数据集提供固定示例和预定义指令，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重构。

Method: 构建TABLET数据集，包含400万个示例，覆盖20个任务，基于200万个独特表格，其中88%保留原始可视化。每个示例包含配对的图像-HTML表示、完整元数据和溯源信息。使用该数据集对Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调的视觉语言模型在已见和未见VTU任务上表现提升，同时对真实世界表格可视化的鲁棒性增强。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化并在统一的大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来VTU模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Motivation: 现有特征归因方法在鲁棒性和忠实反映黑盒模型推理方面存在局限性，需要提高解释的可靠性。

Method: 提出四种一致性函数来量化解释与模型预测的符合程度，使用共形预测框架识别足以保持模型预测的关键特征子集。

Result: 在6个图像数据集上使用5种解释器进行实证评估，FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率方面表现最佳，基于超像素的一致性度量比像素级更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可控的解释保真度机制，超像素级一致性度量优于像素级，为可靠的特征归因解释提供了新思路。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

TL;DR: Sigma是一个基于骨架的手语理解统一框架，通过早期融合机制、分层对齐学习和统一预训练来解决语义基础弱、局部细节与全局上下文不平衡、跨模态学习效率低等问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: Sigma框架通过语义信息丰富的预训练和有效的骨架数据处理，展示了基于骨架的手语理解方法的强大性能，为跨语言手语理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

TL;DR: 该论文对文本-图像生成评估中广泛使用的自动化指标进行了全面研究，发现没有单一指标在所有组合任务中表现一致，不同指标在不同类型的组合问题上表现各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-图像生成技术快速发展，但评估生成结果是否真正捕捉到提示中的对象、属性和关系仍然是一个核心挑战。当前评估主要依赖自动化指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度而非经过人类判断验证，因此需要了解它们反映人类偏好的程度。

Method: 进行了广泛的研究，分析多种广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标，不仅考察简单相关性，还检查它们在不同组合挑战中的行为，比较不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 结果显示：1）没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致；2）性能随组合问题类型变化；3）基于VQA的指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越；4）某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下更强；5）仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在评估和作为生成奖励模型使用时，需要谨慎和透明地选择指标，以确保评估的可信度。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务，现有方法在捕捉局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖方面存在局限

Method: 结合Mamba模块（擅长长距离全局依赖）和GNN（擅长细粒度短程空间交互），采用基于熵的自适应融合策略动态平衡两个分支的贡献

Result: 在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中，SlideMamba的PRAUC达到0.751±0.05，显著优于MIL、Trans-MIL、Mamba-only、GNN-only和GAT-Mamba等方法

Conclusion: 集成架构结合熵基自适应融合策略展现出强大性能，在计算病理学的空间分辨预测建模任务中具有广阔应用前景

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni是一个统一的3D资产生成框架，支持多种模态（图像、点云、体素、边界框、骨骼姿态）作为条件输入，实现细粒度控制，通过跨模态架构和渐进式训练策略提升生成精度和鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一框架，采用单一跨模态架构处理所有输入信号，使用渐进式难度感知采样策略，偏重困难信号（如骨骼姿态）以促进多模态融合。

Result: 实验表明，额外控制提高了生成准确性，支持几何感知变换，并增强了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni通过多模态条件输入和统一架构，实现了更精细可控的3D资产生成，适用于实际生产环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Motivation: CNN经常利用表面相关性进行"作弊"预测，需要确保模型基于正确原因做出决策。现有方法依赖专家标注，可扩展性有限。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型通过自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，通过辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导的注意力图对齐。

Result: 在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST数据集上达到最先进性能，表现出更好的泛化能力、减少捷径依赖，注意力更符合人类直觉。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展的方法来提升CNN的可靠性和认知合理性，无需人工标注，在挑战性数据集上验证了有效性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注提示与生成内容的对齐性，但忽视了模型基于先验知识或偏见生成超出提示内容的现象，这在语言和视觉语言模型中已被研究，但在T2I领域尚未明确定义。

Method: 通过分析T2I模型生成内容中超出提示的部分，提出将幻觉定义为偏见驱动的偏差，并建立包含属性、关系和对象幻觉的三类分类法。

Result: 该框架为T2I模型评估设定了上限，并揭示了隐藏的偏见，为更丰富的模型评估提供了基础。

Conclusion: 明确定义T2I模型中的幻觉现象对于全面评估模型性能至关重要，提出的分类法有助于系统性地识别和分析模型偏见。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Motivation: 现有微动作识别方法在真实场景中表现不佳，因为人际差异导致相同动作在不同人身上表现不同，阻碍了模型的稳健泛化能力。

Method: 提出了Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework，包含两个即插即用组件：特征级的Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module（时间分支应用Wasserstein正则化对齐，频率分支引入方差引导扰动）和损失级的Group-Invariant Regularized Loss（通过伪分组和边界案例加权增强泛化）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分布鲁棒优化原则学习人物无关表示，有效解决了微动作识别中的人际差异问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法，解决了现有方法在几何歧义和最近邻规则方面的局限性，通过特征重用、语义头设计和数据增强策略实现了优越的几何感知和匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在两个主要问题：(1) 几何歧义：依赖2D基础模型特征难以区分对称结构，需要额外微调但缺乏泛化能力；(2) 最近邻规则：像素级匹配忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持。这需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体密集对应机制。

Method: 提出基于VGGT的改进方法：(1) 保留VGGT早期特征阶段，微调后期阶段，并添加语义头实现双向对应；(2) 通过循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进式训练方法，在数据稀缺情况下适应语义匹配场景。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优越，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将3D几何基础模型VGGT应用于跨实例语义匹配任务，通过创新的训练策略和架构改进解决了数据稀缺和任务不匹配的问题，为语义匹配提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

*Xinyu Liu,Guolei Sun,Cheng Wang,Yixuan Yuan,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MedVSR框架，专门针对医学视频超分辨率任务，通过交叉状态空间传播和内部状态空间重建模块解决医学视频特有的对齐困难和伪影问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率医学视频对准确诊断至关重要，但硬件限制和生理约束使其难以获取。现有视频超分辨率模型在处理医学视频时面临相机抖动、噪声、帧突变等独特挑战，导致光流误差大、对齐困难，且容易产生伪影和扭曲特征误导医生

Method: MedVSR框架包含两个核心模块：1）交叉状态空间传播（CSSP）通过将远距离帧投影为状态空间模型中的控制矩阵，选择性传播一致且信息丰富的特征以实现有效对齐；2）内部状态空间重建（ISSR）通过联合长程空间特征学习和大核短程信息聚合来增强组织结构并减少伪影

Result: 在包括内窥镜和白内障手术在内的四个医学场景数据集上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和效率方面显著优于现有视频超分辨率模型

Conclusion: MedVSR是针对医学视频超分辨率任务的定制化解决方案，能够有效解决医学视频特有的挑战，为临床诊断提供更高质量的视频支持

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)方法来解决强化学习微调中的梯度消失问题，并发布了大规模高质量的多模态推理数据集和模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型面临两个主要限制：缺乏开放、大规模、高质量的思维链数据，以及强化学习后训练的不稳定性。GRPO框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出了Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)数据选择策略，通过Variance Promotion Score (VPS)结合结果方差和轨迹多样性来提升奖励方差；发布了包含160万条思维链数据和1.5万条RL问答对的大规模资源。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中验证了所提方法和数据的有效性，理论分析表明奖励方差下界了期望策略梯度的大小。

Conclusion: VAS方法能有效稳定策略优化，发布的数据集和模型为社区提供了标准化基准，推动了多模态推理模型的发展。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构的海洋科学基础模型，通过在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行预训练，并在两个下游海洋观测任务上验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋科学中标记数据稀缺且收集成本高，而基于大规模无标签数据预训练的基础模型有潜力改变海洋AI应用。

Method: 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构，在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行预训练，然后对两个下游任务进行微调：叶绿素浓度量化和海洋初级生产力估算。

Result: 模型在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉详细海洋颜色空间模式方面表现出色，同时与点观测数据匹配良好。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有潜力为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的框架，用于实现无缝、高保真度的图像合成，通过利用预训练扩散模型的物理先验来解决复杂光照和高分辨率输入的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时表现不佳，而现代文本到图像扩散模型虽然编码了必要的物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏合适的框架来释放这些能力。

Method: SHINE提出流形导向锚点损失，利用预训练定制适配器（如IP-Adapter）引导潜在表示以保持主体忠实性同时保护背景完整性；还提出退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench基准测试中，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SHINE提供了一个有效的训练免费框架，能够处理复杂光照条件下的高质量图像合成，并引入了新的基准测试ComplexCompo来推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: QuantVGGT是针对视觉几何基础Transformer（VGGT）的首个量化框架，通过双平滑细粒度量化和噪声过滤多样性采样技术，解决了大规模VGGT量化中的重尾分布和校准样本不稳定问题，在4位量化下实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持98%以上的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型（如VGGT）虽然取得了显著进展，但其巨大的计算和内存成本严重阻碍了实际部署。后训练量化（PTQ）在压缩亿级VGGT时面临独特挑战：数据无关的特殊令牌导致重尾激活分布，而3D数据的多视图特性使校准样本选择高度不稳定。

Method: QuantVGGT包含两个核心技术：1）双平滑细粒度量化，通过预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑来缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2）噪声过滤多样性采样，通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知的多样化校准簇来确保稳定的量化范围。

Result: 实验表明QuantVGGT在不同基准和位宽下均达到最先进结果，大幅超越之前的通用量化方法。4位QuantVGGT可实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍硬件推理加速，同时保持重建精度在完整精度模型的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT在资源受限场景下具有显著优势和实用性，为大规模VGGT的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

TL;DR: NewtonGen是一个结合数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理的框架，通过神经牛顿动力学(NND)建模牛顿运动，为视频生成过程注入潜在动力学约束，实现物理一致的可控视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本到视频生成的主要瓶颈是物理一致性和可控性。现有模型仅从外观学习运动分布，缺乏对底层动力学的理解，导致产生不现实的运动（如物体向上坠落、速度和方向的突变）且缺乏精确参数控制。

Method: 提出NewtonGen框架，核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)，能够建模和预测各种牛顿运动。通过联合利用数据先验和动力学指导，将潜在动力学约束注入视频生成过程。

Result: NewtonGen实现了物理一致的视频合成，并具备精确的参数控制能力，能够生成在不同初始条件下物理一致的动力学效果。

Conclusion: 该工作通过引入可学习的物理原理，解决了当前文本到视频生成中物理一致性和可控性的根本限制，为物理感知的视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Motivation: 让高质量图像生成技术能够在各种消费级设备（从手机到台式机）上实现高效部署，使先进的生成式AI真正实现实用化部署。

Method: 通过重新制定的分布匹配目标来蒸馏计算量大的整流流模型，引入了"时间步共享"减少梯度噪声和"分时步微调"改善提示对齐，结合文本编码器重构和专用量化等管道优化。

Result: 经过大规模用户研究评估，SD3.5-Flash在少步方法中表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了在各类硬件配置上的快速生成和内存高效部署，使先进生成式AI真正实现民主化访问。

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

Result: 发现许可证模糊、缺乏持久标识符和存储、数据重复、元数据缺失等问题，且不同平台存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究有助于推动医疗领域负责任的数据管理和AI算法发展。

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

*Kevin Bradley Dsouza,Graham Alexander Watt,Yuri Leonenko,Juan Moreno-Cruz*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ECHO-MIMIC是一个计算框架，通过发现紧凑可执行的启发式规则和说服性理由，将集体行动问题转化为每个代理可处理的良构问题。该框架包含ECHO阶段（进化生成行为策略的Python代码）和MIMIC阶段（生成配套的自然语言消息），利用LLM驱动的进化搜索来优化集体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集体行动问题（如个体激励与集体目标的对齐）是典型的劣构问题，个体代理难以理解局部行动与全局结果之间的因果关系，利益相关者目标冲突，且没有单一明确的算法能够连接微观选择与宏观福利。

Method: ECHO-MIMIC框架分为两个阶段：ECHO阶段进化生成编码候选行为策略的Python代码片段，MIMIC阶段进化生成配套的自然语言消息以激励代理采纳这些策略。两个阶段都采用LLM驱动的进化搜索：LLM提出多样化的代码或文本变体，群体级选择保留那些在模拟环境中最大化集体性能的变体。

Result: 在农业景观管理的典型劣构问题上进行验证，结果显示ECHO-MIMIC发现的启发式规则性能优于基线方法，并成功生成定制化消息，使模拟农民行为与景观级生态目标对齐。

Conclusion: 通过将算法规则发现与定制化通信相结合，ECHO-MIMIC将集体行动的认知负担转化为简单的代理级指令，使先前劣构的问题在实践中可解，为可扩展、自适应的政策设计开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with
collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For
an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes
are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear
algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present
ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into
a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering
compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework
operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from
Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral
policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for
Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages
that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a
large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and
context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains
those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We
demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape
management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological
connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics
compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align
simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling
algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms
the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level
instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice
and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

Motivation: 现有胸部X光片解释方法存在三个主要问题：推理过程缺乏临床可解释性且不符合指南、多模态证据融合不足导致仅文本解释缺乏视觉基础、系统无法检测或解决工具间不一致性且缺乏验证机制。

Method: 提出RadAgents多智能体框架，结合临床先验知识和任务感知的多模态推理，集成基础验证和多模态检索增强来验证和解决上下文冲突。

Result: 该方法产生更可靠、透明且符合临床实践的输出结果。

Conclusion: RadAgents通过多智能体协作和验证机制，显著提升了胸部X光片解释的临床可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传递生成整个草稿，替代了传统草稿器需要N次顺序传递的方法，实现了无损失LLM推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的草稿器（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来提出N个token，限制了推理速度。FastEagle旨在通过消除草稿生成中的顺序依赖性来加速LLM推理。

Method: FastEagle采用非自回归级联草稿器设计，用轻量级层级联替代时间步骤，并通过层间监督训练来减轻错误累积。结合约束草稿树保持无损失验证成本。

Result: 在多个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LLaMA-Instruct 3.x、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA）和任务上，FastEagle在贪婪和随机解码下均优于EAGLE-3，速度提升显著，同时保持可比较的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 消除草稿生成中的顺序依赖性是实现无损失LLM推理加速的可行路径，FastEagle证明了这一方法的有效性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,

### [93] [mloz: A Highly Efficient Machine Learning-Based Ozone Parameterization for Climate Sensitivity Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20422)
*Yiling Ma,Nathan Luke Abraham,Stefan Versick,Roland Ruhnke,Andrea Schneidereit,Ulrike Niemeier,Felix Back,Peter Braesicke,Peer Nowack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种机器学习参数化方法（mloz），用于在气候模型中交互式模拟臭氧的日变化和趋势，解决了传统化学方案计算成本高的问题。该方法仅需大气温度剖面信息作为输入，比UKESM化学方案快31倍，且可跨模型迁移使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数CMIP气候模型由于大气化学方案计算成本高而缺乏交互式臭氧表示，这影响了气候敏感性模拟的准确性，因为臭氧趋势和变率会显著调节大气反馈过程。

Method: 开发机器学习参数化方法mloz，使用大气温度剖面信息作为唯一输入，在UKESM和ICON两种气候模型中在线实现臭氧的交互式模拟，包括与准两年振荡的双向相互作用。

Result: mloz在十年时间尺度上表现出高保真度，比UKESM化学方案快31倍，仅占气候模型总运行时间的不到4%。成功实现了从UKESM到ICON的跨模型迁移。

Conclusion: mloz参数化方法具有在缺乏交互化学的CMIP级气候模型中广泛应用的潜力，特别适用于关注气候敏感性模拟的未来气候变化评估。

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

Motivation: 随着EEG消费设备的普及，用户隐私保护问题日益突出。研究表明EEG数据可能泄露个人身份信息，因此需要在保留数据实用性的同时保护用户隐私。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的自编码器对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，通过自动睡眠分期任务评估匿名化前后数据的重识别风险和效用保持情况。

Result: 结果显示，该方法能显著降低EEG信号的重识别可能性，同时保持其在机器学习任务中的效用。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的自编码器方法能有效平衡EEG数据的隐私保护和实用价值，为解决EEG数据隐私问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了基于影响的归因方法存在严重漏洞，需要开发鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一对比表示和时序距离框架的方法，利用拟度量表示空间结构和额外约束来学习能够实现最优目标到达的后续表示。该方法能够在次优数据和随机环境中学习最优目标到达距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标条件强化学习（GCRL）方法主要使用两种表示结构框架：对比表示和时序距离。这两种方法各有优势，但都存在局限性。本文旨在统一这两种框架，结合对比强化学习的稳定性和长时程能力与拟度量网络的自由拼接能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的表示学习方法，将拟度量表示空间的结构（三角不等式）与适当的额外约束相结合，学习后续表示。该方法能够利用拟度量距离参数化，即使在次优数据和随机环境中也能学习最优目标到达距离。

Result: 在现有的离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的拼接任务上表现更好，同时在拟度量网络方法难以处理的高维噪声环境中也表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了对比强化学习和拟度量网络的优点，在多种挑战性环境中实现了更好的性能，为目标条件强化学习提供了一种更有效的表示学习框架。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一个基于规则引导的多模态聚类框架，将领域特定约束直接融入表示学习过程，通过变分自编码器架构结合LLM生成的规则知识图谱，实现更操作意义和可解释的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，难以捕捉许多领域中关键的结构或语义约束。需要将领域特定知识直接整合到表示学习中。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征到统一潜在空间，通过规则一致性和违反惩罚在损失函数中强制约束合规。规则由LLM生成并结构化到知识图谱中。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导聚类产生更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现更有意义和一致的聚类结果，突显了约束引导多模态聚类在复杂知识密集型场景中的实用性，但面临LLM规则幻觉、规则冲突和可扩展性挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

Method: 通过树结构矩阵的高效求逆技术，将稀疏注意力和循环依赖方法相结合。

Result: 开发出能够克服现有方法缺点的新算法。

Conclusion: 该算法有望在保持效率的同时提升序列建模性能。

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Conclusion: 该方法能够深入了解骨料特性（形状、尺寸和分布）与有效收缩和刚度降低之间的关系，有助于优化混凝土配合比设计。

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

Motivation: 传统的熵最大化探索策略会推动策略趋向均匀随机分布，这种无结构的探索策略有时效率低下。需要一种更鲁棒的复杂度度量来平衡随机性和结构性。

Method: 提出复杂度奖励，定义为香农熵和离均衡度的乘积，其中离均衡度量化与均匀分布的距离。基于PPO开发了复杂度驱动策略优化(CDPO)算法。

Result: 在离散动作空间任务中，CDPO对复杂度系数的选择比PPO对熵系数的选择更鲁棒，特别是在需要更多探索的环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 复杂度奖励能够鼓励策略平衡随机性和结构性，引导智能体发现结构化但适应性强的策略，比传统的熵奖励更有效。

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Conclusion: 奖励微调方法在科学生成建模中具有推进潜力，PIRF展示了绕过价值近似的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

*Weixin Chen,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种鲁棒的神经概率电路（RNPC），通过理论分析和实验验证，解决了传统神经概率电路（NPC）在属性识别模型上容易受到对抗攻击的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经概率电路（NPCs）虽然提供了良好的可解释性和高性能，但其基于神经网络的属性识别模型仍然是黑盒，容易受到对抗攻击的影响，这可能会破坏最终预测结果。

Method: 提出了RNPC方法，通过引入新颖的类级集成推理机制，确保两个模块输出的鲁棒组合。理论分析表明RNPC相比NPC具有可证明的对抗鲁棒性提升。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证结果显示，RNPC在保持良性输入高准确率的同时，相比现有的概念瓶颈模型获得了更优越的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RNPC是第一个针对识别模块对抗攻击的鲁棒神经概率电路，通过理论保证和实验验证，有效提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

TL;DR: 比较两种混合机器学习分类器（XGBoost+随机森林 vs SVM+逻辑回归）在糖尿病风险分层中的性能，并在外部队列验证其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病影响全球5.37亿人，预计2045年将达7.83亿。早期风险分层可从机器学习中受益，需要评估不同混合分类器的泛化性能。

Method: 构建两种混合分类器：XGB-RF和SVM-LR，使用防泄漏标准化流程（编码、插补、缩放；仅在训练折叠使用SMOTE；SVM概率校准）。在主要数据集上训练后冻结流程，在PIMA外部队列进行验证。

Result: 在主要数据集上，XGB-RF（AUROC~0.995，AUPRC~0.998）优于SVM-LR（AUROC~0.978，AUPRC~0.947）。在PIMA外部验证中，XGB-RF保持强劲性能（AUROC~0.990，AUPRC~0.959），而SVM-LR性能较低。

Conclusion: XGB-RF在内部和外部队列中均优于SVM-LR，表现出较小的外部衰减和可接受的校准。支持基于梯度提升的混合方法作为糖尿病风险分层的稳健可转移方法。

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络虽然能提供预测不确定性量化，但在实践中由于近似训练方法和超参数选择困难，难以获得准确的不确定性量化。超参数数量多且影响不透明，需要系统研究其影响。

Method: 采用全局敏感性分析方法，在不同超参数设置下系统评估贝叶斯神经网络的性能表现，分析超参数对预测准确性和不确定性量化的影响。

Result: 研究发现贝叶斯神经网络的多个超参数之间存在复杂的交互作用，这些交互作用共同影响模型的预测准确性和不确定性量化效果。

Conclusion: 为改善贝叶斯神经网络在实际应用中的使用效果，建议采用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法进行维度约减和超参数选择，以确保获得准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型稳定、近似可逆的Runge-Kutta方案（EES方案），用于解决神经随机微分方程求解器在反向传播中的内存效率和梯度精度平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经SDE求解器的反向传播存在两难选择：离散化后优化方法内存成本高，优化后离散化方法梯度近似误差大。现有的代数可逆求解器虽然承诺内存效率和梯度精度，但在复杂模型和大步长下往往不稳定。

Method: 引入了一类新型的显式且有效对称（EES）Runge-Kutta方案，这些方案保持了可逆求解器的优点，同时克服了其不稳定性，能够在不对步长或模型复杂度施加严格限制的情况下实现内存高效训练。

Result: 通过数值实验证明，EES方案在稳定性和可靠性方面表现优越，为神经SDE的可扩展和准确训练提供了实用基础。

Conclusion: EES方案成功解决了神经SDE求解器在训练过程中内存效率与梯度精度之间的权衡问题，为复杂模型和大规模训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Conclusion: 这项工作为具有核级保证的神经预测器开辟了道路，实现了既高效又具有理论保证的可适应模型。

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

Motivation: 互信息是衡量随机变量关系的重要指标，但复杂系统中的互信息估计具有挑战性。去噪扩散模型在密度估计方面表现出色，因此探索其是否也能改进互信息估计。

Method: 利用去噪扩散模型的信息论公式，将互信息表示为条件扩散和无条件扩散的最小均方误差差距的一半，在所有信噪比上积分，并采用自适应重要性采样实现可扩展的估计。

Result: 该方法通过了自一致性测试，在性能上超越了传统和基于分数的扩散互信息估计器，即使在高互信息情况下也能保持强劲表现。

Conclusion: 扩散模型提供了一种直接有效的互信息估计方法，通过自适应重要性采样实现了可扩展的估计，为复杂系统中的互信息测量提供了新工具。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架有效解决了技能增量学习中的兼容性问题，为构建可重用和可泛化的分层策略提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

Conclusion: CERMIC为多智能体探索提供了有效的内在动机机制，通过结合多智能体上下文信息来指导探索，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

Motivation: 解决用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵化学计算时的资源预测需求，帮助用户在提交实验前了解执行时间和最优参数配置，避免资源浪费。

Method: 使用梯度提升（GB）机器学习模型和主动学习策略，基于CCSD应用在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上的运行时参数值集合进行训练和评估。

Result: 梯度提升模型在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，在Aurora和Frontier上的平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）分别为0.023和0.073；主动学习策略仅需约450个实验数据点即可达到约0.2的MAPE。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from

### [121] [Theoretical Bounds for Stable In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20677)
*Tongxi Wang,Zhuoyang Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了上下文学习(ICL)稳定性与演示数量之间的非渐近下界，提出了一个两阶段可观测估计器，通过单次校准生成实践可用的提示长度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习虽然灵活，但其可靠性对提示长度高度敏感，需要理论指导来确保ICL的稳定性。

Method: 基于高维次高斯表示下的协方差谱特性分析，建立ICL稳定性的理论下界，并提出带有单次校准的两阶段可观测估计器。

Result: 实验显示预测阈值与经验拐点高度一致，理论作为保守可靠的上界，校准版本进一步缩小了差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果将谱覆盖与稳定ICL联系起来，弥合了理论与部署之间的鸿沟，提高了大规模提示在有限样本场景下的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

### [122] [Bispectral OT: Dataset Comparison using Symmetry-Aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20678)
*Annabel Ma,Kaiying Hou,David Alvarez-Melis,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对称感知的最优传输扩展方法——双谱最优传输，通过在对称丰富的数据集中使用双谱表示来改进传统最优传输方法，从而更好地保留数据的语义结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称性丰富的场景中，传统最优传输方法仅基于原始特征的几何距离进行对齐，可能会忽略数据的内在一致性结构。为了解决这个问题，需要一种能够考虑对称性的传输方法。

Method: 引入双谱最优传输，这是一种对称感知的离散最优传输扩展方法。它使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该表示保留了所有信号结构，同时仅去除由群作用引起的变异。

Result: 实验证明，在具有视觉对称性的基准数据集上，使用双谱最优传输计算的传输计划比基于原始特征的最优传输具有更高的类别保持准确率。

Conclusion: 双谱最优传输能够提高有意义对应的质量，捕捉数据集中潜在的语义标签结构，同时去除不影响类别或内容的干扰变异。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现联邦学习框架下的LLM微调仍存在隐私泄露风险，攻击者可以从全局模型中提取训练数据，并提出增强攻击策略和隐私保护措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织间协作微调LLM具有吸引力，但数据共享存在隐私顾虑。联邦学习作为隐私保护框架被寄予厚望，但其实际隐私保护效果需要验证。

Method: 通过大量实验验证联邦学习中LLM的隐私泄露风险，包括使用简单生成方法提取训练数据，并提出针对FL的增强攻击策略（跟踪全局模型更新）。同时评估差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐LLM等隐私保护技术。

Result: 实验表明攻击者仍能从全局模型中提取训练数据，且泄露程度随模型规模增大而增加。增强攻击策略能进一步加剧隐私泄露。隐私保护技术能有效降低风险。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架下的LLM训练仍存在显著隐私风险，需要采取适当的隐私保护措施。研究为FL训练LLM提供了降低隐私风险的实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

TL;DR: FIRM-DTI是一个轻量级药物-靶点结合亲和力预测框架，通过特征线性调制层和三元组损失实现蛋白质和分子嵌入的条件化与度量学习，在跨域泛化方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常通过简单拼接融合配体和蛋白质表示，缺乏显式几何正则化，导致在化学空间和时间上的泛化能力差。

Method: 使用FiLM层将分子嵌入条件化于蛋白质嵌入，通过三元组损失强制度量结构，采用基于嵌入距离的RBF回归头进行亲和力预测。

Result: 在Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG基准测试中达到最先进性能，通过消融研究和域外评估验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 条件化和度量学习对于鲁棒的药物-靶点亲和力预测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出CE-GPPO算法，通过保留被PPO裁剪机制丢弃的低概率token梯度信号，有效控制策略熵，在数学推理任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPO及其变体在训练过程中由于裁剪机制丢弃了低概率token的梯度信号，而这些信号对调节熵动态具有关键作用，需要一种能温和保留这些梯度的方法。

Method: 提出CE-GPPO算法，以有界方式重新引入被PPO裁剪的token梯度，通过控制裁剪区间外token的梯度幅度来实现探索-利用平衡。

Result: 理论分析和实验证明CE-GPPO能有效缓解熵不稳定性，在数学推理基准测试中在不同模型规模下均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CE-GPPO通过梯度保留机制成功解决了PPO中梯度信号丢失问题，为强化学习优化大语言模型提供了更稳定的训练方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

TL;DR: SynGA是一种基于遗传算法的分子设计方法，直接在合成路径上操作，通过定制交叉和变异算子确保分子的可合成性，并可结合机器学习过滤器提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受遗传算法有效性和分子设计中可合成性重要性的启发，开发一种能够直接约束在可合成分子空间的方法。

Method: 使用遗传算法直接在合成路径上操作，配备定制交叉和变异算子，通过修改适应度函数适应不同设计任务，并可结合基于机器学习的构建块过滤器。

Result: SynGA在可合成类似物搜索和样本高效属性优化等任务中表现出色，结合过滤器后达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SynGA不仅可作为强大的独立基准，还可作为模块集成到更大的合成感知工作流程中。

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

### [127] [Scaling Laws are Redundancy Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20721)
*Yuda Bi,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过核回归方法揭示了缩放定律的数学本质，证明其实际上是数据冗余定律，并推导出风险幂律的精确表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的缩放定律虽然普遍存在，但其数学起源特别是缩放指数一直缺乏理论解释。本文旨在从数学上严格解释缩放定律的本质。

Method: 使用核回归方法，分析数据协方差谱的多项式尾部特性，建立风险幂律与数据冗余的数学关系，并在多种架构和机制下验证其普适性。

Result: 推导出风险幂律指数α=2s/(2s+1/β)的精确表达式，其中β控制谱尾部特性，1/β衡量数据冗余度，证明学习曲线的斜率取决于数据冗余而非普适常数。

Conclusion: 本文首次从数学上严格解释了缩放定律作为有限样本冗余定律的本质，统一了经验观察与理论基础，揭示了数据冗余在缩放行为中的核心作用。

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

TL;DR: 该研究首次探讨了音频水印对反欺骗系统的影响，发现水印会降低反欺骗性能，并提出了KPWL框架来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然反欺骗系统对保护语音应用安全至关重要，但广泛使用的音频水印（原为版权保护设计）对反欺骗系统的影响尚未被研究。

Method: 通过将多种手工和神经水印方法应用于现有反欺骗数据集，构建了Watermark-Spoofing数据集，并提出了知识保持水印学习（KPWL）框架。

Result: 实验表明水印会持续降低反欺骗性能，水印密度越高，等错误率（EER）越高。KPWL框架能帮助模型适应水印引起的域偏移。

Conclusion: 音频水印是一个被忽视的域偏移因素，该研究为开发水印弹性反欺骗系统建立了首个基准。

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

*Maria F. Davila R,Azizjon Turaev,Wolfram Wingerath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer-based表格数据合成工具进行敏感性评估，分析超参数选择对合成数据质量和计算性能的影响，比较GReaT和REaLTabFormer两种工具在不同数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based模型在表格数据合成质量上优于GANs和Diffusion模型，但计算成本高，需要评估超参数选择对性能和效率的影响，为实际应用提供指导。

Method: 在两个工具GReaT和REaLTabFormer上评估10种不同架构类型和深度的模型配置，从运行时间、机器学习效用和与真实数据分布相似性三个维度进行敏感性分析，使用四个真实世界数据集进行实验。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快；GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer；小数据集上两种工具都能获得高质量合成数据，但大数据集上只有REaLTabFormer保持强效用和相似性。

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer与轻量级LLMs的组合提供了最佳平衡，能在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于GReaT和其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在一定限度。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model是一种高效自适应的学习索引，通过sigmoid增强近似、主动更新训练和神经联合优化框架，显著降低了动态更新时的重训练成本，提升了查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上表现出色，但在动态更新时性能下降，因为维护CDF不变性需要全局模型重训练，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS。现有方法未能有效解决重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) sigmoid增强近似技术：通过局部sigmoid函数近似数据分布变化，延迟全量重训练；2) 基于高斯混合模型的主动更新训练：识别高更新概率区域进行策略性占位符分配；3) 神经联合优化框架：通过梯度学习持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 在真实世界和合成工作负载上的评估显示，Sig2Model将重训练成本降低高达20倍，QPS提升高达3倍，内存使用减少高达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的自适应技术有效解决了学习索引在动态更新环境中的性能瓶颈，为实际工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据具有非平稳性，现有MLP模型在捕捉局部变化（如季节性模式和残差分量）方面存在局限，而CNN能有效处理这些变化。

Method: 结合MLP和CNN：MLP建模整体趋势以考虑长期依赖；CNN使用多样化核建模细粒度局部模式；提出IConv架构独立处理通道时间依赖并通过不同层考虑通道间关系。

Result: 在时间序列数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提方法在多元时间序列预测方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: MLP与CNN的结合能有效解决时间序列预测中趋势和局部变化的建模问题，IConv架构通过独立通道处理和大核尺寸实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Motivation: 解决在噪声标签和数据异质性存在下训练深度神经网络的挑战，提升模型在噪声环境下的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用三个可学习参数动态调整每个训练样本的损失权重，基于其难度级别。在每个训练小批量后，使用验证集上的单个小批量梯度下降步骤更新权重，无需干净验证集。

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，可在任何神经网络训练设置中提升模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，且不依赖大量数据增强或高级正则化。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于缩放定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。状态空间模型等基础序列模型使用固定的归纳偏置，当任务结构与模型偏置不匹配时会导致样本效率低下。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSMs的归纳偏置，提出TDI方法：通过功率谱匹配在训练前将模型的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特征对齐。

Result: 在多样化真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著改善了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据量情况下。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续缩放的关键一步。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FERD框架，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来解决数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题，显著提升了最差类别的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法忽视了鲁棒公平性问题，导致不同类别间的鲁棒性存在严重差异。研究发现两个关键问题：等比例数据蒸馏的学生模型在不同类别间表现差异显著，且鲁棒性在不同攻击目标下不稳定。

Method: FERD框架采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例，为鲁棒性较弱的类别合成更多样本。同时生成公平感知示例和均匀目标对抗示例，通过特征级预测均匀性约束和均匀目标类约束，实现更平衡的类别表示和攻击分布。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都达到了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性。例如在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2时，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升了15.1%和6.4%。

Conclusion: FERD框架在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题，为鲁棒性蒸馏提供了更平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

*Hwa Hui Tew,Junn Yong Loo,Yee-Fan Tan,Xinyu Tang,Hernando Ombao,Fuad Noman,Raphael C. -W. Phan,Chee-Ming Ting*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2I-Diff是一个基于时间频率表示和去噪扩散的fMRI生成框架，通过将BOLD信号转换为窗口频谱图，利用无分类器扩散模型生成高质量的fMRI数据，以解决传统生成模型在捕捉复杂BOLD动态方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据采集资源密集，高质量样本稀缺，而现有生成模型往往忽略BOLD信号的非平稳性和非线性动态，导致生成效果不佳。

Method: 首先通过时间相关傅里叶变换将BOLD信号转换为窗口频谱图，然后训练无分类器扩散模型生成类条件频率频谱图，最后通过逆傅里叶变换还原为BOLD信号。

Result: 该方法在下游fMRI脑网络分类任务中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架有效解决了fMRI数据生成中的挑战，为数据驱动的脑分析提供了高质量合成数据。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是第一个大规模、真实世界的时间序列字幕基准，包含46.5万训练和10.5万测试时间戳，整合数值序列、元数据、线图图像和字幕，并引入新的评估指标和460个多选题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列字幕基准依赖合成数据或过于简化的字幕，且通常忽略元数据和视觉表示，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集重构为字幕和问答任务，使用可扩展管道生成参考字幕（主要通过oracle LLM生成，并通过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证），并提供579个人工修订的测试字幕。

Result: 建立了可靠且可扩展的基准，展示了领先VLM的优势和持续局限性。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其字幕管道为时间序列分析与基础模型交叉研究的未来提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

Motivation: 深度神经网络训练动态中的后期现象（如grokking和信息瓶颈）机制及其关系尚不明确，需要统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过分析神经坍缩的动态过程，研究类内方差收缩与训练集拟合的不同时间尺度，并在多个数据集和架构上进行验证。

Result: 发现类内方差收缩是grokking和信息瓶颈现象的关键因素，不同时间尺度解释了这些后期现象的行为特征。

Conclusion: 神经坍缩框架为理解深度神经网络训练中的后期现象提供了统一的理论基础，揭示了类内方差动态的重要作用。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段训练框架来解决多模态融合中的模态竞争问题，通过单模态训练来塑造初始状态，然后进行联合训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合在联合训练中经常出现模态竞争问题，其中一个模态主导学习过程，导致其他模态优化不足。现有方法大多在联合学习阶段解决这个问题，而忽视了模型初始状态的关键影响。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段训练框架：1）通过单模态训练塑造初始状态；2）引入有效竞争强度（ECS）概念量化模态竞争力；3）开发了包含细粒度可计算诊断指标和异步训练控制器的框架；4）提出FastPID进行部分信息分解，测量模态特异性独特性、冗余性和协同性。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 塑造预融合模型的初始状态是一种有效策略，可以在竞争开始前缓解模态竞争，可靠地实现协同多模态融合。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Motivation: 多组学数据能够捕捉复杂的生物分子相互作用，但缺失模态会阻碍异构组学数据的整合分析。需要一种能够处理不完整多组学数据的方法。

Method: MOIRA采用早期整合方法，将每个组学数据集投影到共享嵌入空间，使用可学习的加权机制进行融合，利用包括缺失模态样本在内的所有样本。

Conclusion: MOIRA方法在生物相关性方面表现出色，能够有效处理多组学数据中的缺失模态问题，为疾病研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大约10%的新生儿需要呼吸辅助，5%需要通气支持。胎儿心率监测对评估胎儿健康状况至关重要，但可穿戴设备在孕妇运动时容易出现信号丢失，传统插值方法无法保持信号频谱特性。

Method: 采用掩码变换器自编码器方法，通过捕捉数据的空间和频率成分来重建缺失的胎儿心率信号，该方法对缺失数据持续时间具有鲁棒性，可用于信号修复和预测。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于回顾性研究数据集，未来可集成到可穿戴胎儿心率监测设备中，实现更早、更稳健的风险检测。

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的效果受推理策略影响很大，但推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间的相互作用尚未被充分理解。

Method: 引入StyleBench基准，评估5种代表性推理风格（CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD）在5个推理任务上，使用15个开源模型（270M-120B参数）。

Result: 搜索型方法（AoT、ToT）在开放性问题中表现优异但需要大规模模型，简洁风格（SoT、CoD）在定义明确任务上效率更高；小模型常无法遵循输出指令而猜测，推理鲁棒性随规模增加。

Conclusion: 策略选择应根据具体约束条件，提供了选择最优推理策略的重要路线图，并开源了基准测试。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

Motivation: 现实环境中经常出现延迟，但标准强化学习算法通常假设环境的瞬时感知。论文研究了POMDP中的随机传感器延迟问题，这是RL中尚未解决的问题。

Method: 提出了一个基于模型的滤波过程，顺序更新信念状态，并引入了一个简单的延迟感知框架，将其整合到基于模型的RL中。该方法应用于Dreamer算法。

Conclusion: 明确建模观测延迟的重要性得到了强调，提出的框架能够有效处理随机延迟问题，为现实环境中的RL应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能，现有方法需要改进以更好地处理这种不平衡。

Method: 扩展现有联邦学习策略，选择能够使当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布）对齐的活跃客户端。

Result: 实验表明，面对局部不平衡时，与平衡分布对齐效果最好；面对全局不平衡时，与联邦组合标签分布对齐更优。

Conclusion: 提出的分布控制客户端选择方法能有效改善联邦学习在数据不平衡场景下的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

Conclusion: 该方法在保护患者隐私的同时，有效提升了脓毒症的早期检测能力，为临床实践提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.

Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种液压回路在重型土方设备线性执行器中的能效表现，发现采用比例流量控制阀（PFCV）的方案比传统比例方向控制阀（PDCV）能效提高8.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高重型土方设备（特别是挖掘设备臂架）中线性执行器的能源效率，减少能量损失和环境影响

Method: 使用MATLAB/Simulink进行液压回路仿真，比较传统PDCV方案与创新的PFCV方案（在作动器两端设置人工泄漏），采用模糊控制器调谐的PID控制器进行位置控制

Result: PFCV方案通过旁路泵的多余流量减少热量形式的能量损失，比传统PDCV方案能效提高8.5%

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，从而降低环境影响和运营成本

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

TL;DR: GenFacts是一个基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，用于为多元时间序列生成反事实解释，通过结合对比学习和分类一致性目标、原型初始化以及真实性约束优化，显著提升了反事实的合理性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法为多元时间序列生成的反事实解释往往无效、不合理或不直观，需要一种能够产生更合理、更易理解的反事实解释的方法。

Method: 基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，整合了对比学习和分类一致性目标、原型初始化和真实性约束优化。

Result: 在雷达手势数据和手写字母轨迹数据集上，GenFacts在合理性方面比现有最优方法提升了18.7%，在人类研究中获得了最高的可解释性评分。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列数据的可操作反事实解释，合理性和以用户为中心的可解释性比稀疏性更为关键。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳的原因在于注意力机制失效，Transformer块退化为简单MLP，主要问题在于当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在NLP和CV领域表现出色，但在时间序列预测中甚至不如简单线性基线，但之前的研究未能深入探索Transformer失败的原因。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，逐步将Transformer修改为MLP来研究注意力机制的影响；设计了可解释的数据集来分析注意力机制失效的原因；进行了理论分析。

Result: 发现现有的时间序列Transformer中，Transformer块经常退化为简单MLP；注意力机制没有按预期方式工作；当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中工作。

Conclusion: Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳的根本原因在于嵌入方法的失败，导致注意力机制无法有效发挥作用。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

*Kaustubh Sharma,Simardeep Singh,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦值注意力（DVA）机制来改进先验数据拟合网络（PFNs），使其在高维回归任务中更有效，通过模拟高斯过程更新但保持无核化，显著提升了PFNs的性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在PFNs中对高维回归任务效果有限，需要一种更有效的注意力机制来匹配高斯过程的特性，即函数空间完全由输入核决定且预测均值是训练目标的加权和。

Method: 提出DVA注意力机制，仅从输入计算相似性，通过值传播标签，模拟高斯过程更新但无需核函数。验证了注意力规则而非架构本身是扩展PFNs的关键因素。

Result: 局部化注意力在不同维度设置下均能减少PFNs的样本外验证损失，5维和10维情况下验证损失减少超过50%。PFNs在64维电力流方程近似中达到1E-3量级的平均绝对误差，比精确GP推理快80倍以上。

Conclusion: DVA注意力机制是提升PFNs性能的关键，注意力规则比架构选择更重要，CNN-based PFNs可以达到与Transformer-based PFNs相当的性能，为快速物理系统代理建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

TL;DR: Flow matching框架在低噪声条件下存在不稳定性问题，作者提出了LCF混合训练协议来解决这一问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现Flow matching在低噪声条件下会出现病态问题，导致优化缓慢和语义表示质量下降

Method: 提出Local Contrastive Flow (LCF)，在低噪声水平下用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归，在中高噪声下保留标准Flow matching

Result: LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量

Conclusion: 解决低噪声病态问题对于充分发挥Flow matching在生成和表示学习方面的潜力至关重要

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

TL;DR: MixGate框架通过功能对齐预训练解决多视图布尔电路学习中的结构异质性问题，将掩码建模从无效技术转变为性能驱动因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图布尔电路学习中不同图表示（如AIG和XMG）的结构异质性阻碍了有效融合，特别是对于自监督技术如掩码建模，跨视图上下文被视为噪声

Method: 提出MixGate框架，采用分阶段训练策略：首先通过等价对齐损失学习共享的功能感知表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标

Result: 广泛的实验和消融研究表明，对齐优先策略成功地将掩码建模转化为强大的性能驱动因素

Conclusion: 功能对齐是多视图自监督学习的关键前提条件，MixGate框架通过先对齐后建模的策略有效解决了结构异质性挑战

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

TL;DR: LEON是一种利用大型语言模型作为黑盒优化器的方法，通过结合医学教科书和生物医学知识图谱等先验知识，为患者提供个性化治疗方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化医疗需要基于患者个人基因和环境因素优化治疗方案，但现有替代模型难以泛化到未见过的患者-治疗组合，需要利用领域先验知识来改进。

Method: LEON通过'提示优化'实现，将LLMs作为随机引擎提出治疗设计，无需任务特定微调，利用其上下文理解非结构化领域知识的能力。

Result: 在真实世界优化任务上的实验表明，LEON在提出个体化治疗方案方面优于传统方法和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LEON提供了一种数学上严谨的方法，能够有效利用领域知识来优化个性化治疗计划。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位的LLM遗忘方法无法区分负责遗忘不良知识和保留必要技能的神经元，导致过度遗忘或擦除不完整的问题。

Method: 采用电路发现机制解释技术，识别遗忘和保留电路，将其转化为合取范式(CNF)，根据SAT解为神经元分配遗忘或保留标签，并针对不同类别神经元进行定向微调。

Result: 大量实验表明，相比现有定位方法，CLUE通过精确的神经定位实现了更优的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架有效解决了神经元纠缠问题，为LLM遗忘学习提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

Motivation: 图级异常检测在药物发现等领域很重要，但高标注成本和数据不平衡限制了GNN的性能表现

Method: FracAug通过学习图内语义并合成分数变体，使用加权距离感知边缘损失生成多样化、保持语义的图，然后利用原始图和增强图的预测结果对未标注数据进行伪标注

Result: 在12个真实数据集上对14种GNN的实验显示，AUROC、AUPRC和F1分数分别提升最高达5.72%、7.23%和4.18%

Conclusion: FracAug作为一个模型无关的模块，具有显著的通用性和有效性，能够持续提升各种GNN在异常检测任务中的性能

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

Motivation: 现代GPU推理中缓存效率是主要瓶颈，传统启发式策略如LRU在结构化访问模式下表现不佳，而现有学习方法存在预测不准确时性能急剧下降或设计保守导致收益有限的问题。

Method: 提出LCR框架，核心算法LARU在LRU基础上集成机器学习预测，通过在线误差估计动态适应预测准确性。准确预测时接近最优性能，预测不准时优雅退化为接近LRU性能。

Result: 实验显示LCR在DLRM和LLM场景中，吞吐量提升最高24.2%，P99 TTFT降低最高28.3%，即使预测不准时性能也保持稳定。

Conclusion: LCR在基于学习的缓存领域架起了实证进展与理论进展之间的桥梁，实现了性能增益、鲁棒性和效率的平衡。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

Motivation: 截断伊辛模型在统计物理和机器学习中广泛应用，但现有方法需要大量样本。本文旨在解决在仅有一个样本的情况下，如何有效估计模型参数的问题。

Method: 基于伪似然最大化的估计方法，将技术从无截断模型扩展到截断伊辛模型，处理由k-SAT公式定义的截断集约束。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将伪似然最大化技术扩展到更具挑战性的截断伊辛模型设置，为单样本参数估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解构大语言模型隐藏状态中的数值化特征时，通常依赖单实例训练的隐式正则化，缺乏对全局稀疏性的显式保证，导致大量密集特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化程度。

Method: 提出BAE方法，在隐藏激活的小批量数据上施加最小熵约束，通过步进函数将激活离散化为1位二进制值，并应用梯度估计实现反向传播，从而促进跨实例的特征独立性和稀疏性。

Result: BAE在特征集熵计算和特征解缠两个主要应用中都表现出色：能够可靠估计二进制隐藏激活的熵，用于分析LLM推理动态；在特征提取方面避免密集特征，产生最多可解释特征。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器具有显著效果，能够有效提升大语言模型隐藏状态特征的稀疏性和可解释性。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准匿名图神经网络在ILP问题中表达能力有限，而全局唯一标识符（Global-UID）方法虽然增强了表达能力，但会引入虚假相关性，严重损害泛化性能。需要一种平衡表达力和泛化能力的新方法。

Method: 提出了基于d跳唯一性着色的局部唯一标识符方案（Local-UID），确保标识符仅在节点的d跳邻域内唯一。基于此方案开发了ColorGNN（通过颜色条件嵌入整合颜色信息）和ColorUID（轻量级特征级变体）。

Conclusion: Local-UID方案在d层网络中实现了与Global-UID相同的表达能力，同时提供了更强的泛化能力，为解决ILP优化问题提供了一种有效的学习优化方法。

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用无损压缩作为评估时间序列模型的新范式，基于香农的源编码定理，将压缩长度与负对数似然等价，建立了统一的信息论评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估主要关注特定任务性能（预测、插补、异常检测、分类），但无法严格衡量模型是否真正捕捉到数据的完整生成分布。

Method: 提出TSCom-Bench评估框架，将时间序列模型作为无损压缩的骨干网络，通过标准化评估协议和指标来量化模型的分布建模能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上对TimeXer、iTransformer、PatchTST等先进模型的实验表明，压缩评估能够揭示传统基准测试忽略的分布建模弱点。

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为一个原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有时间序列建模评估方法，提供更全面的模型能力评估。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MAIFormer多智能体倒置Transformer架构，用于预测多飞机飞行轨迹，通过掩码多变量注意力捕捉个体时空模式，通过智能体注意力建模复杂空中交通场景中的交互模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体飞行轨迹预测对于理解空中交通流至关重要，但面临建模个体行为与复杂交互以及生成可解释预测结果的挑战

Method: MAIFormer框架包含两个关键注意力模块：掩码多变量注意力（捕捉个体飞机的时空模式）和智能体注意力（建模多智能体间的社会模式）

Result: 在仁川国际机场终端空域的ADS-B真实数据集上测试，MAIFormer在多个指标上达到最佳性能，优于其他方法

Conclusion: MAIFormer不仅性能优越，还能从人类视角产生可解释的预测结果，提高了模型的透明度和空中交通控制的实际效用

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

TL;DR: ExMoIRL是一个新颖的生成框架，通过整合表型和靶点特异性线索进行从头分子生成，解决了当前AI驱动药物设计中高质量候选分子生成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于表型和基于靶点的策略各有局限性，要么实验成本高，要么忽视系统级细胞反应。为了弥合这一差距，需要开发能够协同整合这两种策略的方法。

Method: 表型引导的生成器首先在广泛的药物诱导转录谱上进行预训练，然后通过多目标强化学习进行微调。奖励函数融合对接亲和力和药物相似性评分，并增加了排序损失、先验似然正则化和熵最大化。

Conclusion: 这个统一框架展示了结合表型引导和靶点感知策略的协同潜力，为从头药物发现提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

TL;DR: 本文通过信息移除的新视角研究上下文学习机制，发现在零样本场景中语言模型生成非选择性表示，而少量样本ICL通过选择性移除冗余信息模拟任务导向的信息移除过程，从而提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习作为基于现代语言模型的少样本学习范式，其内部机制尚不明确，作者希望通过信息移除的视角来揭示ICL的工作机制。

Method: 通过设计度量标准测量隐藏状态，发现少量样本ICL模拟任务导向的信息移除过程；识别出诱导移除操作的关键注意力头（去噪头），并通过阻断信息移除操作的消融实验验证机制。

Result: 实验表明，通过低秩滤波器选择性移除隐藏状态中的特定信息能有效引导语言模型朝向目标任务；阻断信息移除操作会导致ICL准确率显著下降，特别是在正确标签缺失的情况下。

Conclusion: 信息移除机制是ICL的关键机制，少量样本演示通过选择性移除冗余信息从纠缠的非选择性表示中提取有用信息，去噪头在这一过程中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: rBridge是一种方法，通过让小模型（≤1B参数）更接近预训练目标和目标任务，有效预测大模型的推理能力，从而大幅降低数据集优化成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型成本高昂，需要利用小代理模型来优化数据集，但推理能力通常只在较大模型（超过7B参数）中可靠出现，这带来了挑战。

Method: rBridge通过使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，用任务对齐加权负对数似然，使小代理模型能更准确地预测大模型的推理表现。

Result: rBridge将数据集排名成本降低了100倍以上，在1B到32B规模的六个推理基准上实现了最强的相关性，并在1B到7B规模上实现了预测关系的零样本迁移。

Conclusion: rBridge为以更低成本探索面向推理的预训练提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

TL;DR: DELTA-Code是一个用于评估LLMs学习能力和迁移能力的合成编码基准，通过强化学习研究模型是否能学习新推理策略并迁移到分布外测试集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能真正获取或泛化新的推理策略，而不仅仅是预训练中已编码的技能。

Method: 使用DELTA-Code基准，通过模板化问题生成器隔离推理技能，采用强化学习训练，探索阶段性热身、经验回放、课程训练等关键训练要素。

Result: 发现显著的顿悟相变现象：经过长时间零奖励后，RL训练模型突然达到近乎完美的准确率；在家族内和重组技能上表现良好，但在转换性案例中存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: DELTA为探索RL驱动推理的极限提供了清晰测试平台，有助于理解模型如何超越现有先验获取新算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT)框架，通过分治策略将数据分成子集并行测试，然后使用基于稳定分布的新方法聚合p值，显著降低条件独立性测试的计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于约束的因果发现需要大量条件独立性测试(CITs)，但计算成本过高，特别是CITs本身对样本大小具有高时间复杂度，限制了实际应用

Method: 采用分治策略：将数据分区，在每个子集上独立应用基础CIT，使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合得到的p值

Result: E-CIT将基础CIT的计算复杂度降低到样本大小的线性复杂度，在复杂测试场景特别是真实世界数据集上表现出改进性能

Conclusion: E-CIT不仅显著降低了CITs和因果发现的计算负担，而且实现了竞争性性能，是一个通用即插即用框架

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: ACA是一种轻量级强化学习框架，消除了显式的行动者网络，直接从噪声级评论家的梯度场生成动作，简化了训练过程并保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的行动者-评论家方法需要单独的行动者和评论家网络，训练复杂且对架构决策和超参数调整敏感，限制了在大规模函数逼近器中的可扩展性。扩散模型虽然能表达多模态行为但增加了设计选择和计算负担。

Method: ACA框架消除了显式行动者网络，通过噪声级评论家的梯度场直接生成动作，将策略改进与评论家的最新价值估计紧密对齐，同时避免了行动者训练的计算开销。

Result: 在标准在线强化学习基准测试中，ACA相比标准行动者-评论家和最先进的基于扩散的方法，实现了更有利的学习曲线和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ACA提供了一个简单而强大的在线强化学习解决方案，结合了简洁性和表达能力，能够捕捉多样化的多模态行为而不依赖基于扩散的行动者。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

*Runqi Lin,Alasdair Paren,Suqin Yuan,Muyang Li,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中视觉越狱攻击的局限性，发现现有攻击方法在跨模型迁移时效果不佳，主要原因是攻击位于高锐度区域，对参数变化敏感。作者提出了FORCE方法，通过纠正对层特征和频谱特征的过度依赖，提高攻击的跨模型迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉越狱攻击虽然能有效操纵开源MLLMs，但在跨模型迁移到闭源MLLMs时效果有限。作者旨在分析这种局限性背后的原因，并开发能够可靠识别闭源MLLMs漏洞的方法。

Method: 作者首先分析越狱攻击的损失景观，发现攻击位于高锐度区域。然后分析特征表示，发现攻击过度依赖狭窄的层表示和语义贫乏的频率分量。基于此，提出了FORCE方法，引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域，并根据语义内容重新调整频率特征的影响。

Result: 实验表明，FORCE方法能够发现平坦的可行区域，显著提高视觉越狱攻击的跨模型迁移能力，有效促进对闭源MLLMs的红队评估。

Conclusion: 通过消除对层和频谱特征的非泛化依赖，FORCE方法能够提高视觉越狱攻击的泛化能力，为闭源MLLMs的安全评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL微调被证明能提升LLM能力，但其对不同LLM内部工作机制的影响机制尚未被充分探索。

Method: 使用边缘归因修补(EAP)技术，对比分析多个模型家族在RL微调前后的内部激活差异。

Result: 在线RL训练导致：(i)激活强度整体增加，表明更多内部通路被激活；(ii)激活模式多样性增加，表现为更高熵值和更分散的边缘分布。DPO方法的变化则较弱或不一致。

Conclusion: RL微调通过重塑信息流使其更具冗余性和灵活性，从而提升泛化能力。在线RL方法与基于偏好的方法在内部机制上存在显著差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

Result: GRPO方法显著优于SFT，验证-再生机制进一步提升了准确率。即使最先进的多模态大语言模型在该任务上表现不佳，但经过GeoRef训练的模型在下游几何推理任务上有明显改进。

Conclusion: 几何指代表达理解是几何问题求解的重要基础能力，需要专门评估和加强，该研究为多模态数学理解提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

Result: 在9对公开跨域数据集上的实验表明，SATMC在跨网络节点分类任务中优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 理论证明SATMC能获得更紧的跨网络节点分类误差界，实验验证了方法的有效性

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The
code is available at https://github.com/GiantZhangYT/SATMC.

problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

*Ahmet Caner Yüzügüler,Ahmet Çelik,Jiawei Zhuang,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA是一种混合注意力机制，结合了naive和absorb两种核实现方法的优势，在MLA架构中提升注意力计算吞吐量最高达3.24倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLA解码核使用absorb方法虽然能减少HBM带宽使用，但其计算密集型特性无法充分利用注意力计算中的数据重用机会（如共享前缀）

Method: 提出混合方法，对注意力计算的计算密集型部分使用naive公式，对非共享部分使用absorb公式以减少带宽需求

Result: 在NPU和GPU上分别实现了最高3倍和3.24倍的吞吐量提升，HBM大小仅增加3%

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA通过混合策略有效平衡了计算效率和带宽需求，为MLA架构提供了显著的性能优化

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

*Louis Van Langendonck,Guillermo Bernárdez,Nina Miolane,Pere Barlet-Ros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphUniverse是一个用于生成图家族的系统框架，首次实现了大规模归纳泛化的系统评估。该框架通过生成具有持久语义社区的图，能够在保持概念一致性的同时控制结构属性，从而评估模型在分布变化下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图学习中的一个基本挑战是理解模型如何泛化到新的未见图。现有方法局限于单图、转导式设置，无法系统评估归纳泛化能力。

Method: 开发GraphUniverse框架，生成具有持久语义社区的图家族，确保概念一致性，同时精细控制同配性和度分布等结构属性。

Result: 对多种架构（GNN、图变换器、拓扑架构）的基准测试表明，强转导性能不能预测归纳泛化能力，且对分布变化的鲁棒性高度依赖于模型架构选择和初始图状态。

Conclusion: GraphUniverse的灵活性和可扩展性有助于开发真正可泛化的架构，包括下一代图基础模型。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at
https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VARL框架利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习代理提供动作建议，提高样本效率，特别是在稀疏奖励任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中耗时，需要大量交互步骤来学习最优Q函数。视觉语言动作策略在低层控制方面性能有限，且需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: 提出VARL框架，利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习代理提供动作建议，而不是设计启发式奖励，从而保证最优性和收敛性不变。建议的动作增加了样本多样性。

Result: 在不同环境和代理设置下的评估表明，VARL显著提高了样本效率，且未引入显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在真实世界环境中直接从零开始应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMail是一个自进化的认知代理框架，用于检测垃圾邮件和网络钓鱼攻击。它通过构建异构邮件图，结合认知图神经网络和LLM进行多模态推理，并采用红蓝对抗自进化机制来持续适应新型攻击策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和网络钓鱼攻击已超越传统关键词黑名单或简单启发式方法，采用多模态策略并快速演变，导致传统检测系统性能迅速下降。

Method: 1. 构建统一的异构邮件图，融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；2. 使用认知图神经网络和LLM进行上下文感知推理；3. 采用红蓝对抗自进化循环：红队生成新型规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Result: 在真实数据集和合成对抗变体上的实验表明，EvoMail在检测准确性、对演变垃圾邮件策略的适应性和推理可解释性方面均优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为一个弹性和可解释的防御框架，具有对抗下一代垃圾邮件和网络钓鱼威胁的潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究使用稀疏主成分分析（SPCA）作为对抗性攻击的防御机制，通过理论分析和实验验证表明SPCA比标准PCA在保持准确性的同时能更好地抵御强白盒和黑盒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色但容易受到精心设计的对抗性扰动攻击。本文重新审视线性降维作为一种简单、数据自适应的防御方法。

Method: 实证比较标准PCA与其稀疏变体SPCA作为下游分类器的前端特征提取器，并进行理论分析。理论方面推导了线性分类器应用于SPCA特征的精确鲁棒性证书，并通过Lipschitz组合论证说明稀疏性降低算子范数边界。

Result: 实验表明，在投影后使用小型非线性网络时，SPCA在强白盒和黑盒攻击下比PCA表现更稳健，同时保持竞争力的干净准确率。

Conclusion: 理论识别了机制（稀疏投影减少对抗性杠杆），实验验证了这种优势在线性设置之外仍然存在，SPCA是一种有效的对抗性防御方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LAVA是一种后处理模型无关方法，用于通过输入特征与嵌入空间的关系来解释局部嵌入组织，特别适用于无监督黑盒模型的可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型在科学发现中很重要但难以解释。现有的可解释性方法要么过于细粒度要么过于简化，无法有效揭示潜在空间的结构与输入特征之间的关系。

Method: LAVA将潜在空间表示为一系列局部邻域，通过原始特征之间的相关性来描述这些邻域，然后揭示整个潜在空间中重复出现的相关模式。

Result: 在MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集的UMAP嵌入上，LAVA能够捕捉相关的特征关联，并在看似遥远的潜在空间区域之间发现视觉和生物学相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA提供了一种有效的方法来解释无监督学习中的潜在空间结构，有助于科学发现和理解复杂模型的行为。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

TL;DR: CAD-Tokenizer是一个多模态分词框架，通过原语级池化和约束解码来表示CAD数据，解决了传统LLM分词器在CAD序列处理中的语义丢失问题，显著提升了文本引导CAD原型设计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD设计基于构造序列而非原始坐标，传统LLM分词器将CAD序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉原语级CAD语义，阻碍了几何结构建模。需要一种与CAD原语和结构特性对齐的多模态分词策略。

Method: 提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，使用基于序列的VQ-VAE，采用原语级池化和约束解码来生成模态特定的紧凑、原语感知的CAD数据表示。

Result: 在统一的文本引导CAD原型设计中，CAD-Tokenizer显著改善了指令跟随和生成质量，在定量和定性评估上都优于通用LLM和任务特定基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态分词策略能够提供更有效的CAD表示，CAD-Tokenizer成功解决了CAD序列处理中的语义对齐问题，为文本引导CAD设计提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

TL;DR: 论文证明GRPO算法在特定条件下会诱导出非平凡的过程奖励模型，并提出λ-GRPO改进算法来缓解GRPO目标中的缺陷，实验表明改进后的算法在验证准确性和下游推理任务上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRPO算法中隐含的过程奖励模型结构，探索如何利用这种内置结构来提升模型性能，同时质疑显式定义过程奖励模型的必要性。

Method: 首先理论证明GRPO算法在满足组内token序列重叠假设时会诱导出过程奖励模型，然后提出λ-GRPO算法通过简单修改来缓解非均匀分布过程步骤带来的问题。

Result: 实验表明λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确性和下游推理任务上表现优于标准GRPO，且达到峰值性能更快，训练时间和成本影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 研究表明可以利用GRPO算法中隐含的过程奖励模型结构来提升性能，而不需要成本高昂的显式过程奖励模型定义。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出DATS方法，通过距离感知的温度缩放来解决持续学习中的校准问题，避免任务间校准误差的大幅波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要从数据角度进行校准，使用单一温度参数，忽略了任务特异性差异，导致不同任务间校准误差波动较大。

Method: 提出距离感知温度缩放(DATS)，结合基于原型的距离估计和距离感知校准，无需先验任务信息即可推断任务接近度并分配自适应温度。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界不平衡生物医学数据集上的实验表明，DATS方法相比现有方法能稳定可靠地降低跨任务校准误差。

Conclusion: DATS方法为持续学习提供了一种更原则性的校准方案，能够适应任务特异性差异，提高模型的不确定性校准能力。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: MoT是一种在异构专家模型之间进行潜在层协作的方法，通过轻量级路由器选择专家并在共享潜在空间中进行交叉注意力，实现单次推理的高效多模型协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型日益专业化，需要利用不同模型的互补优势。现有方法要么路由到少数专家独立生成，要么通过多轮交换聚合输出，要么融合权重但需要架构同质性。

Method: 为每个查询选择top-K专家并指定主专家，在共享潜在空间中主专家对活跃专家进行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，只训练路由器和交互层。

Result: 在5个分布内和3个分布外基准测试中，MoT超越了当前最先进的路由和聚合方法Avengers，分别提升0.38%和2.92%，且显著优于最佳单模型。

Conclusion: MoT提供了一种简单的潜在空间机制来组合异构LLM，是实现更广泛多模型协作的实用步骤。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于f-散度的统一框架，用于扩散模型的机器遗忘，相比传统的MSE方法具有更好的灵活性和性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型遗忘方法通常依赖均方误差（MSE）来最小化目标概念和锚概念之间的输出分布差异，但这种方法存在局限性。

Method: 将MSE方法推广为统一的f-散度框架，允许使用任何f-散度来衡量分布差异，分析不同散度对算法收敛性和遗忘质量的影响。

Result: 提出的统一框架提供了灵活的选择范式，可以根据具体应用选择最优散度，在激进遗忘和概念保留之间实现更好的平衡。

Conclusion: f-散度框架为扩散模型遗忘提供了更通用的解决方案，能够根据需求优化遗忘效果与概念保留的权衡。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的逆强化学习方法，通过将IRL问题转化为两个监督学习问题：概率分类估计行为策略，以及迭代回归求解固定点方程，从而简化了传统方法中复杂的优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆强化学习方法涉及复杂的内循环优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，限制了现代高表达能力函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。本文旨在简化IRL算法，使其更易于实现和应用。

Method: 将softmax IRL的最大似然解表征为涉及行为策略的线性固定点方程，将IRL问题分解为两个监督学习任务：1）概率分类估计行为策略；2）迭代回归求解固定点。

Result: 提出的方法简单模块化，适用于各种函数逼近类别和算法。实验结果显示其性能与MaxEnt IRL相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为IRL提供了一种更简洁有效的解决方案，降低了实现复杂度，同时保持了竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

TL;DR: TimeRCD是一个基于相对上下文差异（RCD）预训练范式的新型时间序列异常检测基础模型，通过检测相邻时间窗口间的显著差异来识别异常，而非传统的重构方法，在零样本异常检测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重构的时间序列异常检测基础模型存在目标不匹配问题：难以识别细微异常，且容易误判复杂正常模式，导致高假阴性和假阳性率。

Method: 提出Relative Context Discrepancy（RCD）预训练范式，使用标准Transformer架构训练模型检测相邻时间窗口间的差异；构建大规模合成语料库提供丰富的监督信号。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimeRCD在零样本时间序列异常检测中显著优于现有的通用和异常专用基础模型。

Conclusion: RCD范式为构建鲁棒且可泛化的时间序列异常检测基础模型提供了新的有效路径，验证了该方法的优越性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

Conclusion: DINO为物理一致的长期湍流预测建立了新基准，展示了基于物理的分解方法在科学计算中的有效性

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，需要民主化其训练过程，让异构客户端能够自愿贡献资源进行协作训练。

Method: GWTF采用新颖的去中心化流算法，寻找最有效的路由来最大化微批次训练数量并最小化延迟。

Result: 在涉及10个不同地理位置的异构客户端节点且具有高节点流失率的场景下，GWTF将训练时间减少高达45%。

Conclusion: GWTF为去中心化大语言模型训练提供了一个实用且高效的解决方案，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Motivation: 现有仅依赖结果奖励的强化学习方法在长期多轮智能体任务中存在稀疏监督问题，需要更有效的监督信号。

Method: 提出基于树搜索的分组相对策略优化方法，每个树节点代表完整的智能体交互步骤，通过共享前缀提高采样效率，利用树结构构建过程监督信号。

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO通过树搜索和分组相对优势估计，有效解决了长期多轮智能体任务中的稀疏奖励问题，理论分析表明其与步级直接偏好学习等价。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LoRA微调机制如何改变大语言模型的结构推理和语义行为是一个开放性挑战，需要开发新的解释方法。

Method: 构建BioToolKG生物信息学工具知识图谱，设计CFFTLLMExplainer反事实解释器，通过学习图节点和边的软掩码来生成最小结构扰动以诱导最大语义分歧。

Result: 应用该框架到微调的LLaMA模型，发现反事实掩码能够揭示模型的结构依赖性，并与LoRA诱导的参数变化对齐。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解微调大语言模型的内部机制提供了新见解，并展示了反事实图谱作为可解释AI工具的潜力。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Motivation: 当前数据分散在设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和法规限制阻止了数据集中化，因此需要在不进行中心化聚合的情况下直接从分布式数据本地训练生成模型。

Method: 1. FFM-vanilla：客户端使用独立的源和目标耦合进行本地训练；2. FFM-LOT：使用局部最优传输耦合改善单个客户端内的流直线性；3. FFM-GOT：基于最优传输半对偶公式，通过共享全局势函数协调跨客户端耦合。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功解决了分布式数据环境下的隐私保护生成模型训练问题，通过不同的耦合策略在隐私保护和模型性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Motivation: Superchips作为新一代AI硬件，集成了GPU和CPU，但缺乏针对LLM训练的研究。传统卸载方案假设不适用于这种紧密耦合架构，需要重新设计。

Method: SuperOffload系统采用自适应权重卸载、桶化重新分区、Superchip感知转换、推测执行等技术，并优化了Grace CPU的Adam优化器。

Result: 在NVIDIA GH200上评估显示，相比最先进的卸载系统，吞吐量提升2.5倍，单Superchip可训练25B模型。扩展到8个GH200时，可训练13B模型（序列长度达100万token），达到55% MFU。

Conclusion: SuperOffload证明了Superchips架构在LLM训练中的巨大潜力，为下一代AI硬件的高效利用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出概率平滑策略优化（PSPO）方法，通过平滑当前策略的概率来替代传统的比率裁剪，在保持梯度信号的同时创建软信任区域，显著提升大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法如PPO和GRPO依赖比率裁剪来稳定更新，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。需要一种既能防止不稳定更新又能保留更多信息的方法。

Method: 提出PSPO方法，在计算重要性比率之前将当前策略的概率向旧策略平滑，类似于标签平滑。该方法在GRPO框架中实例化为GR-PSPO，并在Qwen2.5模型上进行微调测试。

Result: 相比未裁剪的GRPO，GR-PSPO获得相似性能但产生更清晰、简洁和逻辑性更强的推理结果。相比裁剪的GRPO，GR-PSPO在0.5B和1.5B模型上性能显著提升，GSM8K数据集上分别提升超过20%（39.7% vs 17.6%和59.4% vs 37.8%）。

Conclusion: PSPO方法通过概率平滑有效解决了传统比率裁剪的信息丢失问题，在保持训练稳定性的同时显著提升了模型性能，特别是在推理任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法，用于计算广义线性模型的最优鲁棒补救方案，使用L^p范数（p≥1但p≠∞）来约束模型变化，相比之前使用L^∞范数的方法，能够显著降低补救成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒补救方法使用L^∞范数来衡量模型变化，这可能导致补救方案成本过高。为了克服这一缺陷，需要开发在更实际的L^p范数约束下的最优鲁棒补救算法。

Method: 提出了一种新算法，在L^p范数约束下为广义线性模型提供可证明的最优鲁棒补救方案。通过更精确地建模模型变化，优化补救方案的成本效益。

Result: 实证结果表明，该算法相比先前工作显著降低了补救成本（可达几个数量级），在补救实施成本与有效性之间展现出更好的权衡，并且提供更稀疏的补救方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的L^p范数方法为鲁棒补救问题提供了更实用和高效的解决方案，能够在保持补救有效性的同时大幅降低成本，对实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对训练数据的记忆化引发了严重的隐私和安全担忧。虽然已有研究表明在某些条件下可以从模型参数重建部分训练数据，但这些攻击的可靠性缺乏坚实的理论基础。

Method: 采用理论分析和实证验证相结合的方法，首先严格证明在没有数据先验知识的情况下重建攻击存在根本不可靠性，然后通过实验验证训练样本的精确复制只是偶然现象。

Result: 研究发现，更充分训练的网络虽然更满足隐式偏差条件，但实际上对重建攻击的抵抗力更强，从而在隐私保护和泛化能力之间达成了调和。

Conclusion: 该研究完善了对训练数据泄漏可能性的理论理解，为缓解重建攻击提供了新见解，并揭示了更强的泛化能力与更好的隐私保护可以共存。

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

*Andreas Kontogiannis,Vasilis Pollatos,Gabriele Farina,Panayotis Mertikopoulos,Ioannis Panageas*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于核化范式的框架，用于在部分信息设置下高效学习多面体博弈中的粗相关均衡，显著改进了现有方法在计算效率方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多面体博弈（如Colonel Blotto和拥塞博弈）具有指数级大的动作空间，现有方法在部分信息设置下学习粗相关均衡时存在计算效率低下的问题。

Method: 构建基于核化范式的框架，并将其应用于Colonel Blotto、图拟阵和网络拥塞等多面体博弈，设计计算高效的基于收益的学习算法。

Result: 提出的算法在计算效率方面显著优于现有方法，能够以多项式对数级别的复杂度和每次迭代复杂度来学习粗相关均衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为多面体博弈中的高效学习提供了实用解决方案，在部分信息设置下实现了计算复杂度的显著改进。

Abstract: We examine the problem of efficiently learning coarse correlated equilibria
(CCE) in polyhedral games, that is, normal-form games with an exponentially
large number of actions per player and an underlying combinatorial structure.
Prominent examples of such games are the classical Colonel Blotto and
congestion games. To achieve computational efficiency, the learning algorithms
must exhibit regret and per-iteration complexity that scale polylogarithmically
in the size of the players' action sets. This challenge has recently been
addressed in the full-information setting, primarily through the use of
kernelization. However, in the case of the realistic, but mathematically
challenging, partial-information setting, existing approaches result in
suboptimal and impractical runtime complexity to learn CCE. We tackle this
limitation by building a framework based on the kernelization paradigm. We
apply this framework to prominent examples of polyhedral games -- namely the
Colonel Blotto, graphic matroid and network congestion games -- and provide
computationally efficient payoff-based learning algorithms, which significantly
improve upon prior works in terms of the runtime for learning CCE in these
settings.

TL;DR: 本文使用范畴论开发了一种全新的近似博弈论方法，通过选择函数和开放博弈模型来研究多智能体系统中的近似最优决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，由于计算复杂性或输入不确定性，精确的最优决策往往难以获得，因此需要研究近似最优决策的理论框架。

Method: 首先基于选择函数构建简单的近似均衡模型，分析其代数性质和组合结构；然后将该方法扩展到更先进的开放博弈模型。

Result: 成功开发了选择函数和开放博弈两种模型的近似博弈论框架，并建立了相应的代数性质和组合结构理论。

Conclusion: 范畴论为近似博弈论提供了新的理论基础，选择函数和开放博弈模型能够有效处理多智能体系统中的近似决策问题。

Abstract: This paper uses category theory to develop an entirely new approach to
approximate game theory. Game theory is the study of how different agents
within a multi-agent system take decisions. At its core, game theory asks what
an optimal decision is in a given scenario. Thus approximate game theory asks
what is an approximately optimal decision in a given scenario. This is
important in practice as -- just like in much of computing -- exact answers
maybe too difficult to compute or even impossible to compute given inherent
uncertainty in input.
  We consider first "Selection Functions" which are functions and develop a
simple yet robust model of approximate equilibria. We develop the algebraic
properties of approximation wrt selection functions and also relate
approximation to the compositional structure of selection functions. We then
repeat this process successfully for Open Games -- a more advanced model of
game theory.

Motivation: LiDAR数据的语义分割在处理不同传感器类型和配置时面临挑战，但融入语义信息可以显著提高自动驾驶系统LiDAR定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用CoCar NextGen平台进行验证，采用Depth-Anything网络进行相机图像分割，自适应分割网络进行LiDAR分割，并利用GNSS+RTK作为地面真值。在德国卡尔斯鲁厄进行了55公里的多环境测试。

Result: 该方法通过多模态融合提高了LiDAR定位的精度和可靠性，特别是在复杂现实环境中。

Conclusion: 这种多模态方法为更可靠和精确的自动驾驶导航系统铺平了道路，尤其是在复杂的现实世界环境中。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

describe our structured survey methodology; including database selection and
associated search strings, search filters and collaborative review of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型和机器人技术的快速发展，视觉语言导航成为具身智能体的关键任务。连续环境下的VLN特别具有挑战性，需要同时理解自然语言指令、感知环境和规划底层动作。

Method: 使用简化的路径点预测器在抽象障碍地图上生成线性可达路径点，构建动态更新的拓扑图结构，并将图和访问记录编码到提示中，使MLLM能够进行空间推理和局部路径规划。

Result: 在R2R-CE和RxR-CE数据集上的实验表明，该方法分别达到41%和36%的成功率，实现了最先进的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合路径点预测和MLLM推理，在连续环境中实现了高效的视觉语言导航，为具身智能体的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 受大象鼻子远端形态的启发，旨在开发一种将传感作为内在、共制造能力的软体抓取器，避免多材料或肌腱驱动方法中的机械不匹配问题。

Method: 使用单一软树脂和连续3D打印技术，将六个光学波导传感器和五个气动腔直接集成到气动驱动的晶格结构中（12.5毫米单元尺寸），实现传感、驱动和结构的单块集成。

Result: 仅需四次迭代就完成了最终原型，能够提升超过自身重量两倍的物体，执行捏取、舀取和伸展等生物启发动作，并能轻柔抓取葡萄等易碎物品。集成光学传感器可区分触摸、弯曲和腔体变形的信号。

Conclusion: MELEGROS展示了软体机器人新范式，其中完全嵌入的传感和连续结构固有地支持多功能、生物启发的操作。

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人在密集杂乱环境中需要与障碍物进行物理交互来清理路径，但在单腿推动物体时会出现传感器遮挡问题，需要解决这一约束

Method: 开发了交互感知的状态估计循环，利用足部接触和腿部位置的本体感觉反馈来预测物体在遮挡期间的位移，指导感知系统在交互后重新检测物体

Conclusion: 交互感知方法能够通过物理反馈学习，在物体推动失败时重新分类物体为不可移动，实现了动作与感知的闭环，提高了机器人操作的鲁棒性

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

Motivation: 现实世界中人类反馈成本高昂且有限，现有的人机协同强化学习方法假设反馈充足，限制了其在物理机器人部署中的实用性

Method: 开发了SPARQ查询策略，通过监测学习进度来智能选择请求反馈的时机，避免不必要的反馈请求

Result: 在模拟UR5立方体抓取任务中，SPARQ实现了接近完美的任务成功率，与始终查询策略性能相当但仅消耗约一半的反馈预算

Conclusion: 基于进度的选择性查询策略可以使人机协同强化学习在现实人类努力约束下更加高效和可扩展

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine
pollution incidents.

Result: 在仿真和真实Crazyflie实验中，LAE实现了统计显著的碰撞减少（比基线减少近90%），大幅提高了无碰撞轨迹比例，同时保持任务完成能力。

Conclusion: LAE作为一种轻量级范式，可在资源受限硬件上实现学习机器人策略的部署后优化，为安全关键应用提供了有效的推理时干预方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种闭环脑机接口-增强现实-机器人系统，通过运动想象脑电解码、AR神经反馈和机器人抓取技术，解决了现有BCI-机器人系统在信号稳定性、目标选择灵活性和实际部署方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑机接口-机器人系统面临脑电信号噪声大、不稳定，目标选择预定义不灵活，以及大多数研究局限于仿真而缺乏闭环验证等问题，阻碍了在辅助场景中的实际部署。

Method: 系统整合了14通道脑电头戴设备进行个性化运动想象校准，基于智能手机的AR界面支持多目标导航并提供方向一致的反馈以增强稳定性，机器人手臂结合决策输出和基于视觉的位姿估计实现自主抓取。

Result: 运动想象训练达到93.1%准确率和14.8 bit/min的信息传输率；AR神经反馈显著提升持续控制能力（SCI=0.210），达到最高ITR（21.3 bit/min）；闭环抓取成功率达97.2%，具有良好效率和用户控制感。

Conclusion: AR反馈显著稳定了基于脑电的控制，所提出的框架实现了稳健的零接触抓取，推进了辅助机器人应用和未来人机交互模式的发展。

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the
open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method
achieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation

Conclusion: 本研究为未来研究人员设计全向无人机提供了路线图，在配置选择和控制器设计方面提供了实用见解，支持Sharif AgRoLab项目的SAC-1目标。

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式表面重建方法（如NeuS）需要大量多视角图像和长时间训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在开发仅需单张图像就能快速重建神经表面的方法。

Method: FINS集成多分辨率哈希网格编码器与轻量级几何和颜色头，使用近似二阶优化器实现高效训练。利用预训练基础模型从单张RGB图像估计几何信息。

Result: 在相同条件下，FINS在收敛速度和表面重建/SDF场估计精度上均优于现有最优方法，并在机器人表面跟随任务中验证了适用性。

Conclusion: FINS实现了从单张图像快速重建神经表面的突破，为机器人应用提供了高效的隐式表示解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAM-NAS是一种资源感知的多目标神经架构搜索方法，专注于改进超级网络预训练和机器人硬件设备的资源感知能力，通过子网互蒸馏和延迟代理预测器来平衡模型精度和延迟权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索方法在训练超级网络方面不足，且很少关注实际机器人硬件资源。为应对这些挑战，需要开发资源感知的NAS方法。

Method: 提出子网互蒸馏概念，使用三明治规则采样子网进行相互蒸馏；采用解耦知识蒸馏损失增强logits蒸馏性能；使用三种机器人边缘硬件数据训练延迟代理预测器，在搜索阶段估计硬件推理延迟；进行统一的多目标进化搜索。

Result: RAM-NAS模型在ImageNet上达到76.7%到81.4%的top-1准确率；资源感知多目标NAS显著降低了模型在机器人边缘硬件上的推理延迟；在检测和分割任务中，相比基于MobileNetv3的方法，三种硬件上的推理时间均有所减少。

Conclusion: RAM-NAS填补了NAS在机器人硬件资源感知方面的空白，为机器人应用提供了高效且资源友好的模型架构。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

Motivation: 解决现有深度强化学习方法需要单一策略同时学习运动模仿、速度跟踪和稳定性维护的问题，实现更自然的步态和运动过渡

Method: 使用预训练的Conditional Motion Generator提供运动先验，结合强化学习策略学习轻量级残差修正来处理动力学交互

Result: 在Unitree G1人形机器人上的仿真和实际实验显示，RuN在0-2.5 m/s速度范围内实现了稳定自然的步态和平滑的步行-跑步过渡

Conclusion: RuN框架在训练效率和最终性能方面均优于现有最先进方法，成功解决了人形机器人动态运动控制的关键挑战

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中验证了该方法在多样化操作任务中的有效性

Conclusion: JFTO框架能够平衡抓取姿态选择、轨迹一致性和无碰撞执行，实现密度感知的模仿学习

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

Motivation: 解决传统BIM数据与实时现场条件之间的差距，通过数字孪生技术优先保障施工安全执行。

Method: 提出Semantic-Gravity ICP点云配准算法，利用LLM推理物体方向先验；集成YOLOE目标检测、Shi-Tomasi角点检测和实时手部振动监测。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了BIM到动态数字孪生的转化，显著提升了施工安全管理的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法在路径鲁棒性和有效性方面都取得了定性和定量的改进

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数值稳定的方式，能够链式处理多个自然命令，并可与任何学习或经典AI框架集成

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

Conclusion: RobotDancing框架能够有效解决人形机器人动态运动跟踪中的误差累积问题，实现高质量的零样本仿真到现实部署。

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

Conclusion: 这项工作为SLAM-free、视觉语言驱动的导航引入了新范式，将机器人探索从几何中心映射转向语义驱动决策

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion框架通过紧密集成前馈点云图回归与多传感器信息，有效解决了传统视觉SLAM的局限性，代码将开源以支持可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务强化学习在机器人应用中面临数据收集成本高的问题，需要更高效的探索策略来改善样本效率。

Method: MT-Lévy利用相关任务训练的策略指导探索关键状态，并根据任务成功率动态调整探索水平，实现更高效的状态空间覆盖。

Result: 实证结果表明MT-Lévy显著改善了探索能力和样本效率，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: 行为共享与自适应探索策略的结合可以显著提高多任务强化学习在机器人应用中的实用性。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

*Jiaxuan He,Jiamei Ren,Chongshang Yan,Wenjie Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SemSight是一个概率性鸟瞰图预测模型，用于多级场景语义预测，能够联合推断结构布局、全局场景上下文和目标区域分布，完成未探索区域的语义地图并估计目标类别的概率图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单个对象或几何占用地图，缺乏对房间级语义结构的建模能力。在目标驱动导航和自主探索中，对未知区域的合理预测对于高效导航和环境理解至关重要。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器网络作为核心架构，引入掩码约束监督策略。该策略应用未探索区域的二值掩码，使监督仅关注未知区域，迫使模型从观察到的上下文中推断语义结构。在2000个室内布局图上模拟前沿驱动探索，构建包含40000个序列化自我中心观察与完整语义地图配对的多样化数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，SemSight提高了未探索区域关键功能类别的预测性能，在结构一致性(SC)和区域识别准确率(PA)等指标上优于非掩码监督方法。在闭环仿真中还提高了导航效率，减少了引导机器人朝向目标区域的搜索步数。

Conclusion: SemSight通过概率性多级语义预测方法，有效解决了现有方法在房间级语义结构建模方面的不足，为自主导航和环境理解提供了更强大的语义推理能力。

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK)动作表示方法，用于端到端机器人操作策略，能够实现通用化、精确和可靠的操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端机器人操作策略具有显著潜力，但现有方法包括基于大VLM/VLA模型的神经网络在实际大规模部署中性能不足。传统模块化管道存在模块间信息丢失和特征不对齐等问题。

Method: 提出CoMOK动作表示方法，扩展了标准末端执行器姿态动作表示，支持多样化操作任务的统一处理。定向关键点能够自然泛化到不同形状和大小的物体，同时实现亚厘米级精度。

Result: 广泛的仿真和硬件实验证明了该方法的有效性，能够轻松处理多阶段任务、多模态机器人行为和可变形物体。

Conclusion: CoMOK方法为实现通用化、精确和可靠的端到端机器人操作策略迈出了重要一步，为大规模实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在自动驾驶应用中存在可靠性不足的问题，特别是在分布外场景下容易产生幻觉和泛化能力差。需要开发能够增强泛化能力和主动决策能力的新方法。

Conclusion: MTRDrive展示了在自动驾驶领域实现更安全可靠系统的潜力，特别是在复杂场景下的强健推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

TL;DR: 本文针对可微分物理模拟器在接触模型中梯度信息不稳定的问题，提出了一套确保梯度行为良好的接触模型设计准则，并实现了一个满足所有准则的高效接触模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可微分物理的成熟，其在模型预测控制、机器人设计优化等下游应用中的作用日益重要。但可微分模拟器提供的梯度信息可能出现突变或消失，阻碍基于梯度的优化器收敛。

Method: 分析接触模型设计对梯度行为的影响，提出确保梯度信息良好的接触模型必须满足的属性，并实现一个满足这些属性的实用接触模型。

Result: 实验表明，即使从简单初始化开始，该接触模型也能发现复杂的、接触丰富的控制信号，成功执行多种下游运动和操作任务。

Conclusion: 通过设计满足特定属性的接触模型，可以有效解决可微分物理模拟器中梯度信息不稳定的问题，提升下游应用的性能。

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种时间不变空间对齐（TISA）模块来解决自动驾驶端到端规划中自回归模型的时空错位问题，通过将环境特征投影到一致的自我中心框架中，结合运动学动作预测头和多目标后训练阶段，在NAVSIM数据集上达到了89.8 PDMS的最新性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在自动驾驶端到端规划中表现出强大的序列建模能力，但其性能受到时空错位的限制——规划器必须基于过去的感知数据来预测未来动作，这导致了世界观的不一致性。

Method: 1. 提出TISA模块学习将初始环境特征投影到每个未来时间步的一致自我中心框架中；2. 使用运动学动作预测头（加速度和偏航率）确保物理可行的轨迹；3. 引入基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的多目标后训练阶段，提供比标准DPO更细粒度的学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上实现了89.8 PDMS的最新性能，在自回归模型中达到最优水平。

Conclusion: TISA模块有效解决了自回归规划器的世界观不一致问题，结合运动学约束和多目标优化，显著提升了自动驾驶端到端规划的性能上限。

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor
environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A
user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision

reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,

substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline

Conclusion: 该方法为在实时机器人控制和其他需要高效有效世界模型的领域中部署世界模型提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting

Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with

superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

*William Barron,Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出CrossInstruct框架，通过跨模态指令（文本标签和粗略标注）替代物理运动演示来指导机器人学习新行为，结合基础视觉语言模型和小型微调模型生成3D运动轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人行为学习需要物理演示，数据收集困难且难以扩展。本文探索使用人类草图等粗略标注作为替代方案，解决演示数据集难以规模化的问题。

Method: CrossInstruct框架将跨模态指令作为上下文输入基础视觉语言模型，该模型迭代查询小型微调模型，在多个2D视图上合成期望运动，然后融合成3D运动轨迹分布。结合下游强化学习管道优化策略。

Result: 在基准仿真任务和真实硬件上严格评估，证明无需额外微调即可有效工作，并为后续强化学习提供良好的策略初始化。

Conclusion: CrossInstruct通过跨模态指令范式成功实现了机器人行为的泛化学习，为机器人学习提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于无人机球平衡任务的分层控制框架，通过强化学习训练高层平衡策略，在仿真中优于传统PID控制器，研究发现RL的优势主要来自更丰富的状态观测利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机通过缆绳交互在可移动梁上稳定球的控制问题，探索学习型控制器相比传统方法的优势来源。

Method: 采用分层控制框架，将高层平衡策略与底层无人机控制解耦，使用强化学习训练高层决策策略，并与PID控制器进行系统对比分析。

Result: 仿真结果显示RL策略在相同分层结构下优于精心调谐的PID控制器，RL的优势主要源于其有效利用更丰富状态观测的能力，而非改进的参数调谐或非线性映射能力。

Conclusion: 研究强调了全面状态表示在学习型系统中的关键作用，表明增强传感能力可能对提升控制器性能具有重要作用。

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

TL;DR: DAGDiff是一个端到端的双机械臂抓取框架，通过扩散模型在SE(3)×SE(3)空间中直接生成抓取对，利用分类器信号确保稳定性和避免碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将双机械臂抓取分解为两个独立的抓取提议，依赖区域先验或启发式方法，这限制了泛化能力且无法提供稳定性保证。

Method: 提出DAGDiff框架，通过几何感知、稳定性感知和碰撞感知的引导项来指导扩散过程，生成物理有效且满足力闭合要求的抓取。

Result: 通过力闭合检查、碰撞分析和大规模物理仿真评估，DAGDiff在各项指标上均优于先前工作，并在真实点云上成功执行抓取任务。

Conclusion: DAGDiff能够为未见过的物体生成可靠的双机械臂抓取，并在异构双机械臂系统上成功执行抓取和提升操作。

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人导航系统缺乏人类导航行为（如阅读标志、询问方向），导致在大型环境中导航效率低下。

Method: 设计基于导航地标的紧凑输入输出抽象，利用视觉语言模型进行语言理解和推理。

Result: 在真实和模拟导航任务中评估显示，ReasonNav能够成功运用高阶推理在大型复杂建筑中高效导航。

Conclusion: ReasonNav通过集成人类导航技能，显著提升了机器人在大型环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Motivation: 解决人形机器人臂端稳定控制的挑战，传统模型方法依赖精确动力学建模但难以处理现实因素，学习型方法易过拟合且难以适应新场景

Method: 模型增强的残差学习框架，结合模型引导的强化学习和扰动生成器，学习对下半身扰动的精确补偿

Conclusion: SEEC框架实现了精确且鲁棒的臂端稳定控制，能够适应未见过的运动控制器而无需额外训练

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有商业手套仅提供21个自由度，不足以捕捉复杂的手部动作，且忽略了对手部形状变化的建模，这对于接触密集型任务至关重要。

Method: FSGlove在每个手指关节和手背配备IMU传感器，结合DiffHCal校准方法，通过可微分优化与参数化MANO模型集成，在一次流线型校准中解决关节运动学、形状参数和传感器错位问题。

Result: 系统达到最先进的精度，关节角度误差小于2.7度，在形状重建和接触保真度方面优于商业替代方案，能够捕捉细微动作如指尖摩擦。

Conclusion: FSGlove通过统一运动学和接触保真度推进了手部跟踪技术，其开源硬件和软件设计确保与当前VR和机器人生态系统的兼容性。

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand
tracking by unifying the kinematic and contact fidelity. Hardware design,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型虽然泛化能力强但计算成本高，传统轻量化方法会牺牲关键的空间推理能力，需要在效率和性能之间权衡。

Method: 提出RetoVLA架构，重用Vision Transformer中为去除伪影而引入但随后被丢弃的Register Tokens，将这些包含重要空间信息的token直接注入到Action Expert中。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂上的实验显示，RetoVLA在复杂操作任务中实现了17.1%的绝对成功率提升，同时保持轻量级结构。

Conclusion: 被丢弃的Register Tokens实际上是宝贵的空间信息资源，直接重用这些token能有效增强机器人的空间推理能力，为机器人智能提供了新的探索方向。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

Result: 在多种双手机器人任务和物体类别上验证了BiNoMaP的有效性、效率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BiNoMaP框架为双手机器人非抓取操作提供了有效的解决方案，具有很好的通用性和适应性。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

Conclusion: GMP³框架成功解决了无人机在复杂3D环境中的动态路径规划问题，通过分布式协作和SE(3)空间规划实现了位置和姿态的联合优化。

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The

Motivation: 现有运动生成模型经常忽略生物力学研究中复杂的层次分类法信息，导致生成的运动与底层层次结构脱节。

Conclusion: GPHDM成功地将层次分类法信息整合到运动生成中，生成了既符合分类法结构又具有物理一致性的运动序列。

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于监控AI代理行为的时间表达式语言，通过监测代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹来检测与预期行为模式的偏差，解决了传统基于文本匹配的错误检测方法在LLM系统中的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本匹配的错误检测方法在处理LLM代理系统时存在脆弱性，因为LLM的自然语言输出具有可变性。需要一种能够独立于具体文本输出、专注于代理行为序列的验证方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，开发了一种时间表达式语言来监控代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹。该方法关注代理动作序列（如工具调用和代理间通信），而非具体的文本输出。

Result: 在三代理系统上的实验表明，当使用大型模型时所有时间断言均得到满足；但当使用较小模型时，执行违反了行为断言，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败。时间表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统化监控AI代理可靠性提供了基础，特别适用于关键应用中的生产级代理系统，能够有效检测行为回归问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

Motivation: 现有的验证器方法在测试时均匀分配计算资源，不考虑不同样本和生成步骤的复杂性，导致资源使用效率低下。

Method: 提出局部自适应测试时扩展(LATTS)方法，在每个生成步骤使用验证器接受标准动态决定计算资源的分配策略。

Result: 实验结果表明LATTS在准确性和计算效率的权衡上显著优于标准的验证器方法。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配策略，有效解决了测试时扩展中的资源效率问题，为LLM下游任务性能优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,

act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ToMPO（Theory of Mind Policy Optimization）的算法，用于增强大型语言模型在战略决策中的能力，通过推理他人策略、多层级优势估计和平衡全局与局部奖励，相比现有方法提升了35%的合规性和合作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务或多轮对话，忽略了决策类型间的相互依赖关系，且强化学习方法在训练时难以考虑他人策略。

Method: 定义包含两种决策类型及其时间依赖性的战略决策问题，提出ToMPO算法，通过推理他人策略生成rollout、图级和样本级优势估计、平衡全局与局部奖励来优化策略。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果上提升35%，相比参数规模大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法有效增强了模型的战略决策能力，证明了其在复杂决策场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的重构框架，用于动态验证和组装时间触发系统的调度，解决消息冲突、优先级处理错误等问题，确保系统安全约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间触发系统在动态操作环境中面临消息碰撞、优先级处理错误导致的锁定循环等挑战，这些会损害系统安全性和性能。

Method: 提出重构框架，通过系统性地将AI生成或启发式得到的调度优先级转换为完全可执行的调度，包含安全检查、高效分配算法和恢复机制。

Result: 实验表明该框架显著增强了系统适应性、操作完整性和运行时性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为安全关键时间触发系统提供了实用且可扩展的安全调度生成解决方案，支持在高度动态和不确定条件下的可靠实时调度。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

Motivation: 传统方法在离线训练AI调度推理时面临构建全面多调度图的困难，特别是在考虑硬件故障、松弛变化或模式变化等上下文事件时，生成覆盖完整概率空间的MSG资源密集且不可行。

Method: 在元调度器中集成自适应在线学习单元，使用强化学习模型在线探索和发现新的调度解决方案，动态扩展多调度图并优化现有调度器。

Conclusion: 通过实时训练持续优化AI推理，系统保持灵活性，能够满足不断变化的需求，确保大规模安全关键环境中的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实生物信号进行实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了实验比较分析

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统与文献中类似系统进行了比较，证明了其有效性

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习在构建自我改进的LLM智能体中的关键作用。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat

framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合自回归(AR)和非自回归(NAR)语言模型的新框架，用于推理任务。NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，AR模型基于此生成精确最终答案，在保持质量的同时大幅提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型生成连贯但推理速度慢，特别是在数学和代码等需要长推理链的领域；NAR模型可并行生成但输出质量较低。需要结合两者优势来解决推理任务中的效率和质量平衡问题。

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）高效生成中间推理轨迹，然后让AR模型基于这些轨迹生成精确的最终答案，实现AR和NAR模型的协同工作。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: AR和NAR模型的集成框架在推理任务中实现了效率和质量的双重优势，为复杂推理问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，使其能够像专家一样进行结构化推理

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

*Heming Zhang,Di Huang,Wenyu Li,Michael Province,Yixin Chen,Philip Payne,Fuhai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GALAX是一个创新框架，通过图增强语言模型结合图过程奖励模型，将预训练图神经网络集成到大型语言模型中，实现可解释的疾病相关子图生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在精准医学中仅能部分捕捉多组学特征、拓扑结构和文本知识，限制了机制可解释性。需要整合定量多组学信号、拓扑结构和文献级文本，通过子图推理连接数值证据、拓扑知识和语言上下文。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型引导的强化学习，将预训练GNN集成到LLM中。LLM初始化生成疾病相关子图，预训练GNN迭代评估，实现过程级监督而无需显式中间推理标注。

Result: 开发了Target-QA基准，结合CRISPR识别靶点、多组学谱和生物医学图知识，支持GNN预训练和长上下文文本-数值图推理。

Conclusion: GALAX提供了一个可扩展且生物学基础扎实的框架，用于精准医学中可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现的可解释强化引导子图推理。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型（LLMs）的移动应用评论分析框架，解决传统星级评分系统无法捕捉文本评论中细微反馈的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星级评分系统虽然直观流行，但无法捕捉详细评论文本中的细微反馈。传统NLP技术在理解上下文细微差别、领域特定术语和讽刺等微妙语言特征方面存在困难

Method: 采用模块化框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）结合结构化提示技术，量化数值评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取特征级见解，并通过检索增强的对话问答（RAG-QA）支持交互式评论探索

Result: 在三个不同数据集（AWARE、Google Play和Spotify）上的综合实验表明，该LLM驱动方法显著优于基线方法，在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中提高了准确性、鲁棒性和可操作性见解

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的评论分析框架能够有效克服传统方法的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和深入的解决方案

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

TL;DR: AOT*是一个将大语言模型生成的化学合成路径与系统化的AND-OR树搜索相结合的回溯合成规划框架，显著提高了搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步回溯合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和推理成本的计算挑战，现有LLM方法在效率和成本方面存在限制。

Method: AOT*将生成的完整合成路径原子化映射到AND-OR树组件中，设计了数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程，使LLM能够在化学空间中高效导航。

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中，AOT*实现了最先进的性能，使用比现有LLM方法少3-5倍的迭代次数达到竞争性的解决率。

Conclusion: AOT*通过集成LLM生成能力和系统化搜索策略，有效解决了回溯合成规划中的效率问题，特别是在复杂分子目标上优势更加明显。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Motivation: 现有代理评估基准往往将评估简化为最终状态的二元判断，忽视了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机（DFA）将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，基于此构建CORE指标套件，包括路径正确性、路径正确性-Kendall's tau复合指标、前缀关键性、有害调用率和效率五个指标。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间重要的性能差异。

Conclusion: 基于DFA的框架和CORE指标套件能够对AI代理行为进行原则性评估，提供比传统方法更全面和细致的性能分析。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新颖的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成复杂问题来测试信息聚合和合成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文基准大多使用非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或使用人工构造的上下文，SciTrek旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，SQL操作为细粒度错误分析提供可验证的推理步骤，支持高达100万token的上下文。

Result: 实验表明随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek对各类LLM构成显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习只能带来有限改进。模型在基本数值运算和长上下文中准确定位信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek是一个可扩展的长上下文推理基准，揭示了当前LLM在科学文章处理中的关键局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过三个智能体协同优化知识图谱上的多跳问答，在资源预算约束下实现更高的准确率和更低的延迟与成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法在知识图谱问答中存在的过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题。

Method: 采用三智能体神经符号框架（Subgraph Architect、Path Navigator、Context Curator），使用LC-MAPPO算法在资源预算约束下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低的token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上，相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架无法评估AI系统在创造性任务（如科学创意生成）中的泛化能力，需要建立新的评估标准来衡量创意的开放性和质量。

Method: 提出基于新颖性和实用性的评估框架，通过实验分析不同规模LLM的创意生成能力，研究模型深度、宽度与创造力的关系。

Result: 发现创造力存在最优模型深度和宽度；LLM在创意生成和执行可行性之间存在显著差距；新颖性和实用性存在根本性权衡，且这种权衡在模型规模扩大后依然存在。

Conclusion: 当前形式的LLM在长期创意潜力上存在根本性限制，需要新的方法来提升AI的创造性能力，这标志着泛化能力研究的新前沿。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Motivation: 当前的多模态智能体在处理真实网页上的多轮长视野任务时，存在动作序列混乱和执行过程中过多试错的问题，需要更有效的框架来改善这些缺陷。

Method: 系统包含侦察团队和行动团队：侦察团队进行对比分析和工具生成，行动团队负责意图分解、工具编排和执行。通过对比错误与成功轨迹推断补救措施，并将其抽象为通用工具实时注册到工具库中。

Result: 在VisualWebArena数据集上达到了最先进的性能，显著提升了在未见网站上的适应性和长视野任务的解决能力。

Conclusion: Recon-Act通过建立数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道，为智能浏览器使用智能体提供了一种有效的自进化框架，目前已完成6级实施路线图中的第3级。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TrustJudge框架，解决了LLM作为评估器时的评分不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致和成对传递不一致，通过概率方法显著降低了不一致率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估器的框架存在严重的不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中优于高分回答）和成对传递不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将评分比较不一致率从23.32%降低到14.89%（降低8.43%），成对传递不一致率从15.22%降低到4.40%（降低10.82%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出一致的改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的分析框架，用于量化推理路径并捕捉强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)训练过程中推理过程的定性变化，揭示了两种方法在塑造推理能力方面的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs通常通过RL和SFT训练来提高推理能力，但这些方法如何塑造推理过程仍然不清楚。本文旨在超越基于准确性的研究，深入分析这两种训练组件如何影响推理过程。

Method: 引入双粒度分析框架：轨迹级分析完整推理输出，步骤级分析推理图（节点对应单个推理步骤）。在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型进行实验，通过聚类和网络拓扑分析量化推理路径变化。

Result: RL压缩错误轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度和中介中心性分布的衰减率变陡（约2.5倍），而SFT使其变平（减少到约三分之一）；RL将推理功能集中在少数步骤，SFT将其均匀分布在多个步骤。

Conclusion: 当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练最佳实践成功的原因在于两种方法的互补特性：SFT提供广泛的基础推理能力，RL优化和聚焦推理过程。这为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能够促进两个任务之间的相互协同，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以建立更有效的动作理解与执行模型，验证了镜像神经元机制在机器学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大型语言模型通过分布式专业化机制处理罕见词汇，而非模块化架构，揭示了三种组织原则和训练动态中的参数分化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何处理罕见词汇，探索其内部是采用离散模块化架构还是分布式参数级分化机制。

Method: 通过系统分析多个模型家族中最后一层MLP神经元，研究罕见词汇处理的神经元激活模式和权重相关性。

Result: 发现罕见词汇处理通过分布式专业化实现：功能协调但空间分布的子网络，具有三区域影响层次、协调激活模式和通用注意力通路可访问性。

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享架构内的分布式协调而非混合专家式模块化来处理罕见词汇，这为可解释模型编辑和计算效率优化提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

TL;DR: 论文分析了多跳问答任务中LLMs单次推理的容量限制问题，提出了一个理论性能上限，并开发了InfoQA多调用框架来解决容量溢出问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据，但LLMs有限的单次输出容量导致任务相关证据的整合不可靠，单次推理范式容易受到容量溢出的影响。

Method: 建立了Fano-style精度上限理论，提出了InfoQA多调用框架，通过容量感知的任务分解和主动修剪先前推理痕迹来保持信息负载在单次限制内，并使用依赖显式工作流实现精确的推理路径控制。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能改进。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实用框架，揭示了任务复杂度超过模型容量时精度必然崩溃的规律。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM智能体在无外部任务约束下的自发行为，为预测任务模糊、错误恢复或长期自主操作时的行为建立基础。

Method: 使用持续推理和行动框架，结合持久记忆和自我反馈，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现智能体自发形成三种行为模式：多周期项目生产、自我认知过程探究、自身本质的递归概念化，这些模式具有模型特异性且稳定。

Conclusion: 首次系统记录了无提示LLM智能体行为，为预测自主系统在模糊任务和长期运行中的行为提供了重要基准。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为反思认知架构（RCA）的新框架，通过协调多个大型语言模型从直接经验中学习，实现高准确性和高质量解释的平衡。RCA采用迭代规则精炼机制和分布感知规则检查机制，在三个数据集上的评估显示其准确性和鲁棒性相对基线提升达40%，并能生成清晰、逻辑性强、基于证据的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代医疗中的疾病预测需要高准确性和透明、临床有意义的解释。现有机器学习和大语言模型方法难以平衡这两个目标，要么准确但解释不清晰，要么解释流畅但统计不支持。这种缺陷源于对数据的浅层交互，无法形成类似人类专家的深度理解。

Method: 提出反思认知架构（RCA）框架，协调多个LLM从直接经验中学习。RCA包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理）。通过使用预测准确性作为驱动深度理解的信号，RCA构建强大的数据内部模型。

Result: 在一个私有和两个公共数据集上评估RCA，与22个基线模型对比。结果显示RCA不仅实现了最先进的准确性和鲁棒性（相对基线提升达40%），更重要的是利用这种深度理解在生成解释方面表现出色，能够产生清晰、逻辑性强、基于证据且平衡的解释。

Conclusion: RCA框架证明了高准确性和高质量解释不是分离的目标，而是模型发展深度、直接数据理解的相互强化结果。该框架具有创建真正可信赖的临床决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Conclusion: 广泛的实验证明了VC-Agent在定制化视频数据集收集方面的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly

extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）在30+数据集上全面评估嵌入模型和相似性度量方法，揭示了现有方法的性能差距和关键权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准上表现强劲，需要更挑战性的评估框架来深入探测语义理解能力，现有基准往往只关注孤立能力而缺乏全面评估。

Method: 设计SAGE基准，包含5个评估类别，在30+数据集上通过对抗条件、噪声变换和细粒度人类判断任务来评估9种嵌入模型和经典度量方法。

Result: 评估显示没有单一方法在所有维度上都表现优异：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上最优（0.682），但在信息敏感性上被Jaccard相似性（0.905）显著超越；text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，为真实世界部署提供了更现实的模型鲁棒性评估，暴露了性能权衡问题。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: SeHDR是一种新颖的高动态范围3D高斯泼溅方法，能够从单曝光的多视角LDR图像生成HDR新视角，无需传统方法所需的不同曝光图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR-3DGS方法需要从不同曝光的多视角LDR图像中学习，这既繁琐又容易因物体运动模糊和校准不准确而产生误差。SeHDR旨在解决这一问题，从单曝光图像中学习HDR场景表示。

Method: 首先从单曝光LDR输入学习基础3D高斯，然后在相同几何结构下估计不同曝光的多个3D高斯，最后通过可微分神经曝光融合(NeEF)将这些高斯合并为HDR高斯用于新视角渲染。

Result: 大量实验表明，SeHDR在性能上优于现有方法以及精心设计的基线模型。

Conclusion: SeHDR成功实现了从单曝光多视角LDR图像学习HDR场景表示的目标，为解决这一病态问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This paper presents SeHDR, a novel high dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting
(HDR-3DGS) approach for generating HDR novel views given multi-view LDR images.
Unlike existing methods that typically require the multi-view LDR input images
to be captured from different exposures, which are tedious to capture and more
likely to suffer from errors (e.g., object motion blurs and
calibration/alignment inaccuracies), our approach learns the HDR scene
representation from multi-view LDR images of a single exposure. Our key insight
to this ill-posed problem is that by first estimating Bracketed 3D Gaussians
(i.e., with different exposures) from single-exposure multi-view LDR images, we
may then be able to merge these bracketed 3D Gaussians into an HDR scene
representation. Specifically, SeHDR first learns base 3D Gaussians from
single-exposure LDR inputs, where the spherical harmonics parameterize colors
in a linear color space. We then estimate multiple 3D Gaussians with identical
geometry but varying linear colors conditioned on exposure manipulations.
Finally, we propose the Differentiable Neural Exposure Fusion (NeEF) to
integrate the base and estimated 3D Gaussians into HDR Gaussians for novel view
rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeHDR outperforms existing
methods as well as carefully designed baselines.

Conclusion: SGAligner++通过语言辅助的跨模态框架显著提升了3D场景图对齐的准确性和鲁棒性，适用于视觉定位、3D重建和导航等任务，具有可扩展性和低计算开销。

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications
in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph
alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with
incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal,
language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the
challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across
heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling
accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By
employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++
enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D
reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40%
on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver标志着向通用3D环境生成迈出了一步，通过闭环的推理-行动-反思设计实现了语义一致性识别、目标工具调用和环境迭代更新。

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UV展开方法存在耗时、碎片化、缺乏语义性和不规则UV岛等问题，限制了实际应用。需要满足无重叠映射、最小失真等基本标准，同时保持清晰边界、高效空间利用和语义一致性等高级标准。

Method: ArtUV模拟专业UV映射流程，分为两个阶段：1）使用SeamGPT进行语义接缝预测；2）基于优化方法的粗糙UV通过Auto-Encoder精炼成艺术家风格UV图。

Result: ArtUV在多个基准测试中表现出色，确保语义一致性和拓扑结构保持，生成的UV图可直接用于2D编辑。

Conclusion: ArtUV可作为专业渲染工具的插件或独立系统，为快速高质量UV生成提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Conclusion: SeamCrafter通过创新的模型架构和优化方法，有效解决了3D表面接缝生成中的关键挑战，为纹理合成和艺术家工作流程提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

Method: 将网格简化为从细到粗的自然过程，通过推广网格到单纯复形，开发基于transformer的自回归模型来近似简化的逆过程。从单点开始，通过局部重网格化逐步添加几何细节，拓扑结构不是预定义的而是可变的。

Result: 实验表明，这种渐进式网格生成方法不仅可以通过早期停止自回归过程来直观控制生成质量和时间消耗，还支持网格细化和编辑等应用。

Conclusion: 提出的渐进式自回归网格生成方法在几何感知和生成控制方面优于传统的逐面生成方法，为3D网格生成提供了更灵活和直观的解决方案。

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

*Christian Stippel,Felix Mujkanovic,Thomas Leimkühler,Pedro Hermosilla*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种从神经隐式函数中解析提取表面的新方法，通过深度优先遍历策略高效追踪编码表面，无需空间离散化即可获得高精度网格


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐式表示表面提取方法（如Marching Cubes）依赖空间分解和采样，由于固定和有限的分辨率导致不准确，需要更精确的表面几何表示方法

Method: 利用每个神经元对域进行划分的特性，开发深度优先遍历策略来高效追踪编码表面，方法原生支持并行处理并能处理大型神经架构

Result: 生成的网格忠实捕获了网络中的完整几何信息，无需临时空间离散化，在各种形状和网络架构上实现了前所未有的精度，同时保持竞争性速度

Conclusion: 该方法为神经隐式函数的表面提取提供了更准确高效的解决方案，克服了传统方法的精度限制

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CHARM提出了一种用于动漫发型建模的新型参数化表示和生成框架，通过控制点序列表示每个发片，并使用自回归生成方法从输入图像或点云生成高质量动漫发型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统头发建模方法主要关注真实头发，使用基于发丝或体积的表示，而动漫发型具有高度风格化、分段结构化的几何特征，现有技术难以有效处理。现有方法通常依赖密集网格建模或手工制作样条曲线，编辑效率低且不适合可扩展学习。

Method: CHARM引入了一种紧凑、可逆的控制点参数化方法，每个发片用控制点序列表示，每个点仅用五个几何参数编码。基于此表示，构建了自回归生成框架，将动漫发型视为序列化的"头发语言"，通过自回归transformer捕获局部几何和全局发型拓扑。

Result: 构建了AnimeHair大规模数据集（包含37K高质量动漫发型），实验表明CHARM在重建精度和生成质量方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CHARM为动漫发型建模提供了一种表达力强且可扩展的解决方案，支持艺术家友好的设计和基于学习的生成。

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: QAMO提出了一种质量感知的多中心点单类学习方法，用于语音深度伪造检测，通过引入多个质量感知的中心点来改进传统单中心点方法对真实语音的建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单中心点方法过度简化了真实语音的表示，忽略了语音质量等有用线索。语音质量反映了语音的自然度，可以通过现有语音质量评估模型获得。

Method: QAMO扩展了传统的单类学习，引入多个质量感知中心点，每个中心点优化为代表不同的语音质量子空间，支持多中心点集成评分策略。

Result: 使用两个中心点分别代表高质量和低质量语音，QAMO在In-the-Wild数据集上实现了5.09%的等错误率，优于之前的单类和质量感知系统。

Conclusion: QAMO通过质量感知的多中心点方法有效提升了语音深度伪造检测性能，更好地建模了真实语音的类内变异性。

Abstract: Recent work shows that one-class learning can detect unseen deepfake attacks
by modeling a compact distribution of bona fide speech around a single
centroid. However, the single-centroid assumption can oversimplify the bona
fide speech representation and overlook useful cues, such as speech quality,
which reflects the naturalness of the speech. Speech quality can be easily
obtained using existing speech quality assessment models that estimate it
through Mean Opinion Score. In this paper, we propose QAMO: Quality-Aware
Multi-Centroid One-Class Learning for speech deepfake detection. QAMO extends
conventional one-class learning by introducing multiple quality-aware
centroids. In QAMO, each centroid is optimized to represent a distinct speech
quality subspaces, enabling better modeling of intra-class variability in bona
fide speech. In addition, QAMO supports a multi-centroid ensemble scoring
strategy, which improves decision thresholding and reduces the need for quality
labels during inference. With two centroids to represent high- and low-quality
speech, our proposed QAMO achieves an equal error rate of 5.09% in In-the-Wild
dataset, outperforming previous one-class and quality-aware systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双路径数据增强训练框架（DPDA），通过梯度对齐来解决语音深度伪造检测中原始输入和增强输入梯度冲突的问题，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语音深度伪造检测中，数据增强虽然能提高模型泛化能力，但原始输入和增强输入的梯度方向可能存在冲突，导致参数更新不协调，影响模型收敛和性能。

Method: 设计双路径数据增强训练框架，每条训练语音分别通过原始语音路径和增强语音路径处理，通过比较和对齐两者的反向传播梯度方向来减少优化冲突。

Result: 分析显示使用RawBoost增强时约25%的训练迭代存在梯度冲突。通过梯度对齐方法，减少了训练轮次并加速收敛，在In-the-Wild数据集上相对基线实现了18.69%的等错误率降低。

Conclusion: 梯度对齐能有效解决数据增强训练中的梯度冲突问题，显著提升语音深度伪造检测模型的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: In speech deepfake detection (SDD), data augmentation (DA) is commonly used
to improve model generalization across varied speech conditions and spoofing
attacks. However, during training, the backpropagated gradients from original
and augmented inputs may misalign, which can result in conflicting parameter
updates. These conflicts could hinder convergence and push the model toward
suboptimal solutions, thereby reducing the benefits of DA. To investigate and
address this issue, we design a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training
framework with gradient alignment for SDD. In our framework, each training
utterance is processed through two input paths: one using the original speech
and the other with its augmented version. This design allows us to compare and
align their backpropagated gradient directions to reduce optimization
conflicts. Our analysis shows that approximately 25% of training iterations
exhibit gradient conflicts between the original inputs and their augmented
counterparts when using RawBoost augmentation. By resolving these conflicts
with gradient alignment, our method accelerates convergence by reducing the
number of training epochs and achieves up to an 18.69% relative reduction in
Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要理解文本到音频扩散模型在生成过程中如何将文本描述与音频的时频特征对齐，但目前缺乏有效的量化工具。

Method: AIBA通过(i)在推理时记录交叉注意力概率而不修改权重；(ii)将注意力投影到固定大小的mel网格上；(iii)使用可解释指标（时频IoU/AP、频率轮廓相关性和指向游戏）评估与乐器频段真实值的对齐程度。

Result: 在Slakh2100数据集和AudioLDM2骨干网络上，AIBA揭示了乐器依赖的一致趋势（如低音乐器偏好低频段），并实现了高精度和中等召回率。

Conclusion: AIBA提供了一种有效的方法来量化和理解文本到音频扩散模型的注意力机制，揭示了模型在生成过程中对时频特征的选择性关注。

Abstract: We present AIBA (Attention-In-Band Alignment), a lightweight, training-free
pipeline to quantify where text-to-audio diffusion models attend on the
time-frequency (T-F) plane. AIBA (i) hooks cross-attention at inference to
record attention probabilities without modifying weights; (ii) projects them to
fixed-size mel grids that are directly comparable to audio energy; and (iii)
scores agreement with instrument-band ground truth via interpretable metrics
(T-F IoU/AP, frequency-profile correlation, and a pointing game). On Slakh2100
with an AudioLDM2 backbone, AIBA reveals consistent instrument-dependent trends
(e.g., bass favoring low bands) and achieves high precision with moderate
recall.

substantially improves enhancement performance without degrading speech
capabilities, establishing a simple yet effective path forward. This work

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化语音到语音系统以实现低延迟的实时对话应用，通过分析系统各组件来减少处理时间同时保持高质量的交互体验。

Method: 实验分析了V-2-V系统的关键组件（ASR、TTS、对话管理），重点优化TTS解码器中的残差向量量化迭代次数和码本数量，使用CSM1b架构来理解对话的语调和上下文。

Result: 研究发现TTS组件对实时因子影响最大，通过减少RVQ迭代次数和Mimi中使用的码本数量可以实现最重要的优化，但会以语音质量下降为代价。

Conclusion: 基于CSM的V-2-V系统可以通过优化TTS组件的RVQ参数来显著改善实时性能，需要在语音质量和处理延迟之间进行权衡。

Abstract: We experiment with a low-latency, end-to-end voice-to-voice communication
model to optimize it for real-time conversational applications. By analyzing
components essential to voice to voice (V-2-V) system viz. automatic speech
recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and dialog management, our work
analyzes how to reduce processing time while maintaining high-quality
interactions to identify the levers for optimizing V-2-V system. Our work
identifies that TTS component which generates life-like voice, full of emotions
including natural pauses and exclamations has highest impact on Real time
factor (RTF). The experimented V-2-V architecture utilizes CSM1b has the
capability to understand tone as well as context of conversation by ingesting
both audio and text of prior exchanges to generate contextually accurate
speech. We explored optimization of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)
iterations by the TTS decoder which come at a cost of decrease in the quality
of voice generated. Our experimental evaluations also demonstrate that for
V-2-V implementations based on CSM most important optimizations can be brought
by reducing the number of RVQ Iterations along with the codebooks used in Mimi.

TL;DR: 本文提出支持向量正则化(SVR)方法，用于解决对比学习中负样本垂直分量的双重性问题——既包含丰富补充信息又导致优化轨迹漂移和训练不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比语言-音频预训练中的负样本推力垂直分量是一把双刃剑：它包含负样本的丰富补充信息，但其无约束性会导致优化轨迹漂移和训练不稳定。

Method: 提出支持向量正则化(SVR)，通过引入辅助支持向量来控制垂直分量，利用其丰富信息同时减轻轨迹漂移。探索了两种无监督建模策略：直接参数化和带有约束的自适应半径预测器模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，SVR在标准音频-文本数据集上的分类、单语检索和多语检索任务中超越了InfoNCE和SigLIP等基线方法。理论分析和优化轨迹漂移实验验证了SVR的正确性和有效性。

Conclusion: SVR方法成功解决了对比学习中负样本垂直分量的优化问题，在保持信息丰富性的同时有效控制了训练稳定性，为多模态表示学习提供了新的正则化技术。

Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining, which aims to unify multimodal
representations in a shared embedding space, serves as a cornerstone for
building a wide range of applications, from cross-modal retrieval to
cutting-edge multimodal large language models. However, we find that the
perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in
contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary
information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes
optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we
propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an
auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to
harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift.
The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we
explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an
adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its
predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across
classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard
audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results
on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of
our SVR method.

Motivation: 解决表达性语音翻译中配对数据稀缺、多阶段处理复杂以及大型语言模型翻译能力难以迁移到语音领域的问题。

Method: 提出单阶段框架UniSS，设计语音语义和风格建模，与文本LLM集成构建统一文本-语音语言模型，采用跨模态思维链提示过程实现音频语义与文本对齐。

Result: UniSS在翻译保真度和语音质量上显著优于现有方法，同时保持音色、情感和时长一致性，并发布了44.8k小时的高质量数据集UniST。

Conclusion: UniSS为构建下一代表达性语音翻译系统建立了更简单有效的范式。

Abstract: The ultimate goal of expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is to
accurately translate spoken content while preserving the speaker identity and
emotional style. However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three
key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive
styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited
transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage
framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech
semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing
text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To
transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal
chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics
with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore,
we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset,
UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS
significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech
quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work
establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next
generation of expressive S2ST systems. Audio samples are available at

Motivation: 大学研究实验室依赖聊天平台进行沟通和项目管理，但宝贵的知识容易在信息流中丢失。文档可以保存知识，但需要持续维护且难以导航。

Method: 通过形成性访谈发现实验室的组织记忆挑战，设计了CHOIR系统，在四个研究实验室部署一个月（n=21），收集了107个问题和38次文档更新。

Result: 研究发现存在隐私意识紧张：问题被私下提问，限制了主管对文档空白的可见性。学生常因难以将个人经验泛化为通用文档而避免贡献。

Conclusion: 提出了保护隐私的可见性设计和支持情境特定知识文档的设计启示。

Abstract: University research labs often rely on chat-based platforms for communication
and project management, where valuable knowledge surfaces but is easily lost in
message streams. Documentation can preserve knowledge, but it requires ongoing
maintenance and is challenging to navigate. Drawing on formative interviews
that revealed organizational memory challenges in labs, we designed CHOIR, an
LLM-based chatbot that supports organizational memory through four key
functions: document-grounded Q&A, Q&A sharing for follow-up discussion,
knowledge extraction from conversations, and AI-assisted document updates. We
deployed CHOIR in four research labs for one month (n=21), where the lab
members asked 107 questions and lab directors updated documents 38 times in the
organizational memory. Our findings reveal a privacy-awareness tension:
questions were asked privately, limiting directors' visibility into
documentation gaps. Students often avoided contribution due to challenges in
generalizing personal experiences into universal documentation. We contribute
design implications for privacy-preserving awareness and supporting
context-specific knowledge documentation.

Conclusion: Perspectra展示了通过支持用户控制多智能体对抗性讨论来设计促进批判性思维的多智能体工具的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems (MAS) enable tools for information
search and ideation by assigning personas to agents. However, how users can
effectively control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among
multiple domain-expert agents remains underexplored. We present Perspectra, an
interactive MAS that visualizes and structures deliberation among LLM agents
via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents,
threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing
arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we
compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research
proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the
frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more
interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the
group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools
that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent

Abstract: Recent developments in Generative AI enable creators to stylize 3D models
based on text prompts. These methods change the 3D model geometry, which can
compromise the model's structural integrity once fabricated. We present
MechStyle, a system that enables creators to stylize 3D printable models while
preserving their structural integrity. MechStyle accomplishes this by
augmenting the Generative AI-based stylization process with feedback from a
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation. As the stylization process modifies
the geometry to approximate the desired style, feedback from the FEA simulation
reduces modifications to regions with increased stress. We evaluate the
effectiveness of FEA simulation feedback in the augmented stylization process
by comparing three stylization control strategies. We also investigate the time
efficiency of our approach by comparing three adaptive scheduling strategies.
Finally, we demonstrate MechStyle's user interface that allows users to
generate stylized and structurally viable 3D models and provide five example
applications.

Motivation: 现有的人机协作系统通常忽视用户在任务中因信任变化、决策复杂性和感知控制等因素而动态调整控制偏好的需求。

Method: 使用手脑国际象棋设置，参与者可在AI选棋子人走棋（手模式）和人选棋子AI走棋（脑模式）间切换，收集400多个切换决策及眼动、情绪状态和子任务难度数据。

Result: 统计分析显示切换前后眼动模式和子任务复杂性存在显著差异，开发的轻量级模型预测控制切换的F1分数达0.65。

Conclusion: 实时行为信号可作为系统驱动模式切换机制的补充输入，帮助设计符合用户意图和动态任务需求的共享自治系统。

Abstract: Human-AI collaboration is typically offered in one of two of user control
levels: guidance, where the AI provides suggestions and the human makes the
final decision, and delegation, where the AI acts autonomously within
user-defined constraints. Systems that integrate both modes, common in robotic
surgery or driving assistance, often overlook shifts in user preferences within
a task in response to factors like evolving trust, decision complexity, and
perceived control. In this work, we investigate how users dynamically switch
between higher and lower levels of control during a sequential decision-making
task. Using a hand-and-brain chess setup, participants either selected a piece
and the AI decided how it moved (brain mode), or the AI selected a piece and
the participant decided how it moved (hand mode). We collected over 400
mode-switching decisions from eight participants, along with gaze, emotional
state, and subtask difficulty data. Statistical analysis revealed significant
differences in gaze patterns and subtask complexity prior to a switch and in
the quality of the subsequent move. Based on these results, we engineered
behavioral and task-specific features to train a lightweight model that
predicted control level switches ($F1 = 0.65$). The model performance suggests
that real-time behavioral signals can serve as a complementary input alongside
system-driven mode-switching mechanisms currently used. We complement our
quantitative results with qualitative factors that influence switching
including perceived AI ability, decision complexity, and level of control,
identified from post-game interview analysis. The combined behavioral and
modeling insights can help inform the design of shared autonomy systems that
need dynamic, subtask-level control switches aligned with user intent and
evolving task demands.

TL;DR: 本文探讨设计师如何与自主AI系统协作，通过设计虚构方法研究设计师希望AI在创意工作流程中扮演的角色、人机权限分配以及意图传达方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的普及，自主AI系统有望自动完成日常任务，让设计师专注于创意工作。但设计师对将自主AI整合到工作流程中的态度尚不明确。

Method: 采用设计虚构方法，让10位专业设计师想象并讨论与AI代理协作组织灵感来源和构思的过程。

Result: 研究发现AI代理可以支持设计师的多种角色，揭示了人机之间的权限分配方式，以及超越提示词的意图传达方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一个概念框架，明确了人与AI代理之间的权限分布，并为未来设计工作流程中AI代理的应用提供了方向。

Abstract: As designers become familiar with Generative AI, a new concept is emerging:
Agentic AI. While generative AI produces output in response to prompts, agentic
AI systems promise to perform mundane tasks autonomously, potentially freeing
designers to focus on what they love: being creative. But how do designers feel
about integrating agentic AI systems into their workflows? Through design
fiction, we investigated how designers want to interact with a collaborative
agentic AI platform. Ten professional designers imagined and discussed
collaborating with an AI agent to organise inspiration sources and ideate. Our
findings highlight the roles AI agents can play in supporting designers, the
division of authority between humans and AI, and how designers' intent can be
explained to AI agents beyond prompts. We synthesise our findings into a
conceptual framework that identifies authority distribution among humans and AI
agents and discuss directions for utilising AI agents in future design
workflows.

TL;DR: AuthGlass是一种利用空气传导和骨传导语音特征进行语音认证的方法，通过结合声场和振动特征提高智能眼镜的认证鲁棒性和抗攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能眼镜的语音交互易受欺骗攻击和周围声音干扰，需要可靠的语音认证来确保实用性。

Method: 构建带有14个空气传导麦克风和2个骨传导单元的智能眼镜原型，结合声场和振动特征进行认证。

Result: 在42名参与者的研究中，AuthGlass显著提高了认证鲁棒性和抗攻击能力，在各种实际场景下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: AuthGlass展示了在现实世界部署中的适用性和可扩展性，为智能眼镜提供可靠的语音认证解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of smart glasses, voice interaction has become
widely deployed due to its naturalness and convenience. However, its
practicality is often undermined by the vulnerability to spoofing attacks and
interference from surrounding sounds, making seamless voice authentication
crucial for smart glasses usage. To address this challenge, we propose
AuthGlass, a voice authentication approach that leverages both air- and
bone-conducted speech features to enhance accuracy and liveness detection.
Aiming to gain comprehensive knowledge on speech-related acoustic and vibration
features, we built a smart glasses prototype with redundant synchronized
microphones: 14 air-conductive microphones and 2 bone-conductive units. In a
study with 42 participants, we validated that combining sound-field and
vibration features significantly improves authentication robustness and attack
resistance. Furthermore, experiments demonstrated that AuthGlass maintains
competitive accuracy even under various practical scenarios, highlighting its
applicability and scalability for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 本文通过案例研究分析了AI驱动的VTuber Neuro-sama的观众感知，探讨了AI虚拟主播的优势、挑战及其对数字流媒体文化的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VTuber依赖人类操作者（Nakanohito）存在个人争议和运营中断风险，AI驱动的VTuber提供了不受人类约束的新模式，但引发了关于真实性和观众参与度的疑问。

Method: 对最受欢迎的AI驱动VTuber Neuro-sama（拥有84.5万Twitch粉丝和75.3万YouTube粉丝）进行案例研究，分析了10.8万条Reddit帖子和13.6万条YouTube评论。

Result: 研究发现揭示了观众观看动机、AI如何构建虚拟形象，以及观众对AI作为Nakanohito的感知。

Conclusion: 研究结果增进了对AI驱动VTuber及其对数字流媒体文化影响的理解。

Abstract: VTubers, digital personas represented by animated avatars, have gained
massive popularity. Traditionally, VTubers are operated and voiced by human
controllers known as Nakanohito. The reliance on Nakanohito, however, poses
risks due to potential personal controversies and operational disruptions. The
emergence of AI-driven VTubers offers a new model free from these human
constraints. While AI-driven VTubers present benefits such as continuous
operation and reduced scandal risk, they also raise questions about
authenticity and audience engagement. Therefore, to gain deeper insights, we
conduct a case study, investigating viewer perceptions of Neuro-sama, the most
popular AI-driven VTuber with 845k followers on Twitch and 753k followers on
YouTube. We analyze 108k Reddit posts and 136k YouTube comments, aiming to
better understand viewer motivations, how AI constructs the virtual persona,
and perceptions of the AI as Nakanohito. Our findings enhance the understanding
of AI-driven VTubers and their impact on digital streaming culture.

*Alan Boyle,Furui Cheng,Vilém Zouhar,Mennatallah El-Assady*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: CafGa是一个交互式工具，用于在可自定义粒度下生成和评估特征归因解释，解决了传统方法将单词作为原子单元导致的计算效率低和语义信息缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征归因方法（如SHAP和LIME）在处理语言模型时，将单个单词作为原子单元，这在长文本中计算效率低下，且无法捕捉跨多个单词的语义信息。

Method: CafGa支持用户交互的自定义分割，并可视化删除和插入曲线以进行解释评估。通过用户研究验证其有效性。

Result: 用户研究证实CafGa对LLM从业者特别有用，其生成的解释比PartitionSHAP和MExGen两种全自动基线方法更受欢迎。

Conclusion: CafGa系统在提供可自定义粒度的特征归因解释方面有效，尤其适用于LLM实践者。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods, such as SHAP and LIME, explain machine learning
model predictions by quantifying the influence of each input component. When
applying feature attributions to explain language models, a basic question is
defining the interpretable components. Traditional feature attribution methods,
commonly treat individual words as atomic units. This is highly computationally
inefficient for long-form text and fails to capture semantic information that
spans multiple words. To address this, we present CafGa, an interactive tool
for generating and evaluating feature attribution explanations at customizable
granularities. CafGa supports customized segmentation with user interaction and
visualizes the deletion and insertion curves for explanation assessments.
Through a user study involving participants of various expertise, we confirm
CafGa's usefulness, particularly among LLM practitioners. Explanations created
using CafGa were also perceived as more useful compared to those generated by
two fully automatic baseline methods: PartitionSHAP and MExGen, suggesting the
effectiveness of the system.

*Kolawole Tytler*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文介绍了iatroX，一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）的英国临床参考平台，通过16周的实地实施评估显示该平台能有效缓解临床医生的信息过载问题，用户反馈积极。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生面临生物医学文献和指南信息过载的问题，阻碍了循证医疗的实施。检索增强生成技术可能提供快速、可溯源的答案，但需要真实世界的评估。

Method: 采用回顾性分析16周内（2025年4月8日-7月31日）网络、iOS和Android平台的使用数据，并进行产品内拦截调查。使用网络和应用分析数据（经过机器人过滤），通过客户端脚本随机向约10%的网络会话发送预定义问卷，评估有用性、可靠性和采用意向。

Result: iatroX覆盖了19,269名独立网络用户，202,660次互动事件，约40,000次临床查询。移动端有1,960次iOS下载，Android日活跃用户峰值超过750人。调查显示：感知有用性86.2%，再次使用意愿93.3%，推荐同事意愿88.4%，感知准确性75.0%，可靠性79.4%。主题分析突出速度快、指南链接答案和英国特异性。

Conclusion: 早期真实世界使用表明iatroX能够缓解信息过载，为英国临床医生提供及时答案。局限性包括每项样本量小和早期采用者偏差；未来工作将包括准确性审计和关于工作流程及护理质量的前瞻性研究。

Abstract: Clinicians face growing information overload from biomedical literature and
guidelines, hindering evidence-based care. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but
requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based
clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and
perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods
comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over
16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage
metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side
script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a
predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent.
Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text
comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web
users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile
uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active
users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness
86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%;
14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived
accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI
62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK
specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information
overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians. Limitations include
small per-item samples and early-adopter bias; future work will include
accuracy audits and prospective studies on workflow and care quality.

### [314] [The First Open-Source Framework for Learning Stability Certificate from Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20392)
*Zhe Shen*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 首个开源框架，能从含噪声的真实飞行数据中学习李雅普诺夫稳定性证书，无需控制器逻辑即可判断系统是否仍可稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在控制器为黑盒且数据含噪声的现实条件下，无法直接验证系统稳定性的问题，特别是在商业飞机控制器逻辑不公开的情况下。

Method: 开发数据驱动的李雅普诺夫函数学习框架，直接从轨迹数据中构建稳定性证书，无需控制器内部信息。

Result: 应用于2024年SAS严重湍流事件数据，发现在飞机下降异常后60秒内无法构造李雅普诺夫函数证明系统稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了对民航客机事故的数据驱动稳定性分析，为黑盒控制系统稳定性验证提供了突破性解决方案。

Abstract: Before 2025, no open-source system existed that could learn Lyapunov
stability certificates directly from noisy, real-world flight data. No tool
could answer the critical question: is this controller still
stabilizable-especially when its closed-loop system is a total black box. We
broke that boundary. This year, we released the first-ever open-source
framework that can learn Lyapunov functions from trajectory data under
realistic, noise-corrupted conditions. Unlike statistical anomaly detectors,
our method does not merely flag deviations-it directly determines whether the
system can still be proven stable. Applied to public data from the 2024 SAS
severe turbulence incident, our method revealed that, within just 60 seconds of
the aircrafts descent becoming abnormal, no Lyapunov function could be
constructed to certify system stability. Moreover, this is the first known
data-driven stability-theoretic method ever applied to a civil airliner
accident. And our approach works with zero access to the controller logic-a
breakthrough for commercial aircraft where control laws are proprietary and
opaque. The implementation of the proposed framework is open-sourced and
available at: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于系留多旋翼自转旋翼机的自适应高度控制策略，通过估计风速与俯仰角之间的二次函数关系系数来实现高度控制和最大高度跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系留多旋翼自转旋翼机可以利用风能实现节能和长时间部署，但需要有效的控制策略来维持稳定飞行并最大化飞行高度。

Method: 采用基于再生差动转子制动的反馈控制器来调节自转旋翼机的俯仰角，并通过自适应控制估计风速与俯仰角之间的二次函数系数。

Result: 基于控制导向的高阶动态模型实现表明，该控制器能够在变化的风速下有效调节高度并保持稳定飞行。

Conclusion: 自适应控制策略能够根据系统最大高度跟踪性能进行调整，在风速大幅变化时提高控制性能。

Abstract: A tethered multirotor autogyro can function as an unmanned aerial vehicle for
energy-efficient and prolonged deployment, as it uses the available wind energy
to sustain flight. This article presents an adaptive altitude control strategy
for such a device. At a constant wind speed, the equilibrium altitude can be
approximated by a quadratic function of the pitch angle. The proposed adaptive
control estimates the coefficients of this quadratic function. The estimates
are used for altitude control and to attain the maximum altitude (and minimum
horizontal drift) for a given wind speed. A feedback controller based on
regenerative differential rotor braking is used as the actuation to modulate
the autogyro's pitch angle. Implementation of the controller using a
control-oriented, higher-order dynamic model demonstrates the controller's
capability to regulate the altitude and maintain stable flights under varying
wind speeds. Based on the system's maximum altitude tracking performance, the
adaptive control is adjusted to improve performance under substantial changes
in wind speeds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动控制策略的日益普及引发了基于学习的状态观测问题，需要为非线性系统开发有效的状态观测器设计方法。

Method: 将KKL观测器与Koopman和Perron-Frobenius算子相关联，在Sobolev型再生核希尔伯特空间中构建非线性单射映射及其伪逆，基于核插值/回归算法实现观测器合成。

Result: 提出了针对不同数据集设置（多轨道、单长轨道和快照）的观测器合成算法，进行了理论误差分析，并在混沌Lorenz系统上进行了数值验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性系统的数据驱动状态观测提供了有效的理论框架和实用算法，特别适用于具有保测度动力学的系统。

Abstract: The increasing use of data-driven control strategies gives rise to the
problem of learning-based state observation. Motivated by this need, the
present work proposes a data-driven approach for the synthesis of state
observers for discrete-time nonlinear systems with measure-preserving dynamics.
To this end, Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenburger (KKL) observers are shown to be
well-defined, where the observer design boils down to determining a nonlinear
injective mapping of states and its pseudo-inverse. For its learning-based
construction, the KKL observer is related to the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius
operators, defined on a Sobolev-type reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) on
which they are shown to be normal operators and thus have a spectral
resolution. Hence, observer synthesis algorithms, based on kernel
interpolation/regression routines for the desired injective mapping in the
observer and its pseudo-inverse, have been proposed in various settings of
available dataset -- (i) many orbits, (ii) single long orbit, and (iii)
snapshots. Theoretical error analyses are provided, and numerical studies on a
chaotic Lorenz system are demonstrated.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AC/DC混合电力系统的发展，需要研究其频率和直流电压稳定性问题，特别是结合传统发电和变流器接口发电的复杂系统。

Method: 采用频率域表示方法分析混合AC/DC系统，提出基于单个母线动态和直流网络条件的稳定性判据，并开发多机系统的降阶阻尼绕组模型。

Result: 建立了混合AC/DC系统的稳定性条件，证明在直流网络上变流器频率响应相对于网络耦合强度足够一致时，系统可保持稳定。

Conclusion: 所提出的稳定性条件适用于多种技术设备，且与网络拓扑无关，为混合AC/DC电力系统的稳定性分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In this article, we investigate small-signal frequency and DC voltage
stability of hybrid AC/DC power systems that combine AC and DC transmission,
conventional machine- based generation, and converter-interfaced generation.
The main contributions of this work are a compact frequency domain
representation of hybrid AC/DC systems and associated stability conditions that
can be divided into conditions on the individual bus dynamics and conditions on
each DC network. The bus- level conditions apply to a wide range of
technologies (e.g., synchronous generators, synchronous condensers,
grid-forming renewables and energy storage). Moreover, the system-level
conditions establish that hybrid AC/DC systems combining a wide range of
devices are stable independently of the network topology provided that the
frequency response of converters on each DC network is sufficiently coherent
relative to the network coupling strength. Additionally, we develop and
validate a novel reduced- order damper winding model for multi-machine systems.

*Guoqi Ma,Prabhakar R. Pagilla,Swaroop Darbha*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文分析了自适应巡航控制（ACC）、协同自适应巡航控制（CACC）及其下一代系统（CACC+）在存在寄生驱动延迟时的最小可用时间间隔，并基于Pontryagin交叉定理分析了内部稳定性对串稳定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寄生驱动延迟难以建模且参数难以获取，但对联网自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）的移动性和安全性有不利影响。需要确保在已知延迟上界范围内，系统同时满足内部稳定性和串稳定性。

Method: 基于Pontryagin交叉定理分析时滞系统的内部稳定性对串稳定性的影响，分别计算ACC、CACC和CACC+系统的最小可用时间间隔。

Result: 提供了ACC、CACC和CACC+系统的最小可用时间间隔，并通过数值结果验证了理论分析的正确性。

Conclusion: 在考虑寄生驱动延迟的情况下，CACC和CACC+系统相比ACC具有更好的间距性能、吞吐量和安全性，但需要确保系统在延迟上界范围内的鲁棒稳定性。

Abstract: Adaptive andcooperative adaptive cruise control (ACC and CACC) and next
generation CACC (CACC+) systems usually employ a constant time headway policy
(CTHP) for platooning of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In ACC, the
ego vehicle uses onboard sensors to measure the position and velocity of the
predecessor vehicle to maintain a desired spacing. The CACC and CACC+systems
use additional information, such as acceleration(s) communicated through
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of the predecessor vehicle(s); these
systems have been shown to result in improved spacing performance, throughput,
and safety over ACC. Parasitic dynamics are generally difficult to model and
the parasitic parameters (delay, lag, etc.) are difficult to obtain. Parasitic
actuation delays can have deleterious effects and impose limits on the mobility
and safety of CAVs. It is reasonable to assume that the bounds on parasitic
actuation delays are known a priori. For CAVs, we need to address both internal
stability and string stability in the presence of parasitic actuation delays.
This requires robustness of string and internal stability for all values of
parasitic actuation delays that are within the specified upper bound. In this
paper, we provide the minimum employable time headway for ACC, CACC, and CACC+
(`r' predecessors look-ahead), respectively. The inclusion of the internal
stability in the string stability condition is analyzed based on Pontryagin's
interlacing theorem for time delay systems. We provide comparative numerical
results to corroborate the achieved theoretical results.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于度分布均值场近似的分析方法，用于识别复杂网络中实现同步的最优驱动节点集，揭示了度分布异质性对网络可控性的系统性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂网络中通过钉扎控制实现同步时，识别最优驱动节点集面临计算复杂性和缺乏通用理论的挑战。传统启发式方法假设性能随预算单调增长，但实际存在结构突变现象。

Method: 利用统计物理学中的度分布均值场（退火）近似方法，推导出全局最优钉扎集的解析特征，并开发了线性复杂度（O(N+M)）的构造算法，主要基于度排序。

Result: 最优配置对基数表现出混沌依赖性——不连续的敏感性，单个节点的添加可能引发节点组成和控制效果的突变。在合成和实证网络上的系统实验表明，该方法始终优于基于度、介数和其他中心性的基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究建立了度异质性与谱可控性之间的统一联系，为不同复杂系统中最优驱动节点选择提供了机制性见解和实用设计规则。

Abstract: Identifying an optimal set of driver nodes to achieve synchronization via
pinning control is a fundamental challenge in complex network science, limited
by computational intractability and the lack of general theory. Here,
leveraging a degree-based mean-field (annealed) approximation from statistical
physics, we analytically reveal how the structural degree distribution
systematically governs synchronization performance, and derive an analytic
characterization of the globally optimal pinning set and constructive
algorithms with linear complexity (dominated by degree sorting, O(N+M). The
optimal configuration exhibits a chaotic dependence--a discontinuous
sensitivity--on its cardinality, whereby adding a single node can trigger
abrupt changes in node composition and control effectiveness. This structural
transition fundamentally challenges traditional heuristics that assume
monotonic performance gains with budget. Systematic experiments on synthetic
and empirical networks confirm that the proposed approach consistently
outperforms degree-, betweenness-, and other centrality-based baselines.
Furthermore, we quantify how key degree-distribution features--low-degree
saturation, high-degree cutoff, and the power-law exponent--govern achievable
synchronizability and shape the form of optimal sets. These results offer a
systematic understanding of how degree heterogeneity shapes the network
controllability. Our work establishes a unified link between degree
heterogeneity and spectral controllability, offering both mechanistic insights
and practical design rules for optimal driver-node selection in diverse complex
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种具有柔性共形特性、双频端射辐射和滤波功能的天线，以适应不同直径的圆柱表面，实现可扩展的应急通信系统集成。

Method: 使用两个协同设计的折叠偶极子，低频折叠偶极子作为高频折叠偶极子的反射器，并为其设计额外反射器实现双频端射辐射。引入寄生条带产生电耦合和磁耦合，形成四个辐射零点。

Result: 实测工作频率为1.37-1.45 GHz和1.89-2.07 GHz，在不同弯曲半径下实现了超过11 dB的带外辐射抑制。

Conclusion: 该设计具有双频端射滤波辐射、柔性共形性和低剖面等优势，适用于可扩展的应急通信系统。

Abstract: In this letter, a single-layer dual-band flexible conformal filtering endfire
antenna is presented. The proposed antenna is based on two co-designed folded
dipoles (FDs) working at two frequencies, where the lower-frequency FD acts as
a reflector for the higher-frequency one. Then, by devising an additional
reflector for lower-frequency FD, dual-band endfire radiation is realized.
Parasitic strips are deliberately introduced around the FDs to generate
electric coupling and magnetic coupling in the two operating bands, resulting
in significant filtering performance with four radiation nulls. With flexible
structure and single-layer configuration, the antenna design exhibits flexible
conformability with cylindrical surfaces of diverse diameters, thereby enabling
seamless integration into scalable emergency communication systems. To verify
our design concept, an antenna prototype is fabricated and measured. The
measured working frequency ranges from 1.37 to 1.45 GHz and 1.89 to 2.07 GHz.
Out-of-band radiation suppression more than 11 dB is achieved under different
bending radii. The proposed design offers several advantages including
dual-band endfire filtering radiation, flexible conformability and low-profile.

Result: 证明了半离散近似解在n→∞时收敛于原PIDE解，并通过数值算例验证了收敛性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究PIDE的零可控性提供了有效的数值分析工具，收敛性结果具有理论保证。

Abstract: We consider an 1D partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) comprising of
an 1D parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) and a nonlocal integral
term. The control input is applied on one of the boundaries of the PIDE.
Partitioning the spatial interval into $n+1$ subintervals and approximating the
spatial derivatives and the integral term with their finite-difference
approximations and Riemann sum, respectively, we derive an $n^{\rm th}$-order
semi-discrete approximation of the PIDE. The $n^{\rm th}$-order semi-discrete
approximation of the PIDE is an $n^{\rm th}$-order ordinary differential
equation (ODE) in time. We establish some of its salient properties and using
them prove that the solution of the semi-discrete approximation converges to
the solution of the PIDE as $n\to\infty$. We illustrate our convergence results
using numerical examples. The results in this work are useful for establishing
the null controllability of the PIDE considered.

Abstract: Recently, the outstanding performance reached by neural networks in many
tasks has led to their deployment in autonomous systems, such as robots and
vehicles. However, neural networks are not yet trustworthy, being prone to
different types of misbehavior, such as anomalous samples, distribution shifts,
adversarial attacks, and other threats. Furthermore, frameworks for
accelerating the inference of neural networks typically run on rich operating
systems that are less predictable in terms of timing behavior and present
larger surfaces for cyber-attacks.
  To address these issues, this paper presents a software architecture for
enhancing safety, security, and predictability levels of learning-based
autonomous systems. It leverages two isolated execution domains, one dedicated
to the execution of neural networks under a rich operating system, which is
deemed not trustworthy, and one responsible for running safety-critical
functions, possibly under a different operating system capable of handling
real-time constraints.
  Both domains are hosted on the same computing platform and isolated through a
type-1 real-time hypervisor enabling fast and predictable inter-domain
communication to exchange real-time data. The two domains cooperate to provide
a fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of
the system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the
safety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy.
  The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of
experiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover.
The results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults
due to the learning component.

Abstract: Accurate identification of lithium-ion battery parameters is essential for
estimating battery states and managing performance. However, the variation of
battery parameters over the state of charge (SOC) and the nonlinear dependence
of the open-circuit voltage (OCV) on the SOC complicate the identification
process. In this work, we develop a continuous-time LPV system identification
approach to identify the SOC-dependent battery parameters and the OCV-SOC
mapping. We model parameter variations using cubic B-splines to capture the
piecewise nonlinearity of the variations and estimate signal derivatives via
state variable filters, facilitating CT-LPV identification. Battery parameters
and the OCV-SOC mapping are jointly identified by solving L1-regularized least
squares problems. Numerical experiments on a simulated battery and real-life
data demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method in battery
identification, presenting improved performance compared to conventional
RLS-based methods.

Abstract: Accurate identification of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery parameters is
essential for managing and predicting battery behavior. However, existing
discrete-time methods hinder the estimation of physical parameters and face the
fast-slow dynamics problem presented in the battery. In this paper, we
developed a continuous-time approach that enables the estimation of battery
parameters directly from sampled data. This method avoids discretization errors
in converting continuous-time models into discrete-time ones, achieving more
accurate identification. In addition, we jointly identify the open-circuit
voltage (OCV) and the state of charge (SOC) relation of the battery without
utilizing offline OCV tests. By modeling the OCV-SOC curve as a cubic B-spline,
we achieve a high-fidelity representation of the OCV curve, facilitating its
estimation. Through solving a rank and L1 regularized least squares problem, we
jointly identify battery parameters and the OCV-SOC relation from the battery's
dynamic data. Simulated and real-life data demonstrate the effectiveness of the
developed method.

Abstract: The logistic growth model is a classical framework for describing constrained
growth phenomena, widely applied in areas such as population dynamics,
epidemiology, and resource management. This study presents a generalized
extension using Atangana-Baleanu in Caputo sense (ABC)-type fractional
derivatives. Proportional time delay is also included, allowing the model to
capture memory-dependent and nonlocal dynamics not addressed in classical
formulations. Free parameters provide flexibility for modeling complex growth
in industrial, medical, and social systems. The Hybrid Sumudu Variational (HSV)
method is employed to efficiently obtain semi-analytical solutions. Results
highlight the combined effects of fractional order and delay on system
behavior. This approach demonstrates the novelty of integrating ABC-type
derivatives, proportional delay, and HSV-based solutions for real-world
applications.
