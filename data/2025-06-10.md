TL;DR: DigitalShadow是一种基于面部基础模型的CAD早期预警系统，通过无接触方式从视频流中提取面部特征，生成个性化风险报告和健康建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球老龄化加剧了医疗系统压力，CAD是主要死因之一，早期检测和管理至关重要。

Method: 系统预训练2100万张面部图像，微调为LiveCAD模型，使用7004张来自1751名受试者的面部图像进行CAD风险评估。

Result: DigitalShadow能被动、无接触地工作，生成自然语言风险报告和个性化建议，支持本地部署以保护隐私。

Conclusion: DigitalShadow为CAD早期检测提供了高效、隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Global population aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems,
with coronary artery disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million
deaths annually, making it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is
largely preventable, early detection and proactive management are essential. In
this work, we introduce DigitalShadow, an advanced early warning system for
CAD, powered by a fine-tuned facial foundation model. The system is pre-trained
on 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a
specialized CAD risk assessment model trained on 7,004 facial images from 1,751
subjects across four hospitals in China. DigitalShadow functions passively and
contactlessly, extracting facial features from live video streams without
requiring active user engagement. Integrated with a personalized database, it
generates natural language risk reports and individualized health
recommendations. With privacy as a core design principle, DigitalShadow
supports local deployment to ensure secure handling of user data.

### [2] [Exploring Adversarial Watermarking in Transformer-Based Models: Transferability and Robustness Against Defense Mechanism for Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06389)
*Rifat Sadik,Tanvir Rahman,Arpan Bhattacharjee,Bikash Chandra Halder,Ismail Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了Vision Transformers（ViTs）在医学图像中对对抗性水印攻击的脆弱性，并通过对抗训练提升了防御性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ViTs在计算机视觉任务中的成功应用，研究其在医学图像中的对抗性攻击脆弱性具有重要意义。

Method: 使用Projected Gradient Descent（PGD）生成对抗性水印，测试ViTs和CNNs的脆弱性，并分析对抗训练的效果。

Result: ViTs对对抗性攻击非常脆弱（准确率降至27.6%），但对抗训练能显著提升防御性能（准确率恢复至90.0%）。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学图像中易受对抗性攻击，但对抗训练是一种有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

### [3] [(LiFT) Lightweight Fitness Transformer: A language-vision model for Remote Monitoring of Physical Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06480)
*A. Postlmayr,P. Cosman,S. Dey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RGB智能手机摄像头的远程健身追踪系统，具有隐私性、可扩展性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健身追踪模型要么运动种类有限，要么过于复杂难以部署，无法泛化到多样化动作。

Method: 开发了一个多任务运动分析模型，结合大规模健身数据集Olympia（覆盖1900多种运动），利用视觉-语言模型进行运动检测和重复计数。

Result: 模型在Olympia数据集上运动检测准确率为76.5%，重复计数准确率为85.3%。

Conclusion: 通过单一视觉-语言模型实现运动识别和计数，推动了AI健身追踪的普及。

Abstract: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for
exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more
private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated
exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise
variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically
focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse
movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model
capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across
hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome
previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia
covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model
is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On
Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count
repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting
a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and
rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered
fitness tracking.

### [4] [GS4: Generalizable Sparse Splatting Semantic SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06517)
*Mingqi Jiang,Chanho Kim,Chen Ziwen,Li Fuxin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯泼溅（GS）的可泛化语义SLAM算法，通过学习网络从RGB-D视频流增量构建3D场景表示，解决了现有GS-SLAM方法依赖场景优化且泛化性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM算法在相机跟踪上表现优秀，但生成的3D地图分辨率低且不完整。现有GS-SLAM方法依赖场景优化，耗时长且泛化性不足。

Method: 使用可泛化网络从RGB-D图像预测高斯参数，集成3D语义分割，并通过全局定位后仅优化1次高斯泼溅来修正定位漂移和浮点问题。

Result: 在ScanNet基准测试中表现最优，高斯数量比其他GS方法少一个数量级，并在NYUv2和TUM RGB-D数据集上展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义SLAM中实现了高效且泛化的3D地图构建，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might
generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting
(GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map
building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene
optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes
well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM
algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from
an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach
starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian
parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location.
Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS
framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To
correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for
only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of
magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and
showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to
the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

### [5] [Bridging Audio and Vision: Zero-Shot Audiovisual Segmentation by Connecting Pretrained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06537)
*Seung-jae Lee,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本视听分割框架，利用预训练模型，无需任务特定训练即可实现声音源分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖大规模像素级标注，成本高且耗时。

Method: 整合音频、视觉和文本表示，探索预训练模型连接策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 多模态模型整合对精细视听分割有效。

Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding
to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance,
and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale
pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To
address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates
task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach
integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps,
enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We
systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models
and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS
performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for
finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

### [6] [Securing Traffic Sign Recognition Systems in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06563)
*Thushari Hapuarachchi,Long Dang,Kaiqi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了针对交通标志识别的深度神经网络（DNNs）的鲁棒性，提出了一种基于数据增强的训练方法以抵御误差最小化攻击，并开发了一个检测模型识别中毒数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DNNs在交通标志识别中的广泛应用，且训练数据来源未知，确保模型在训练过程中不被攻击或中毒至关重要。

Method: 首先对DNNs进行误差最小化攻击，然后提出一种基于非线性变换的数据增强训练方法以提高模型鲁棒性，并开发了一个检测模型识别中毒数据。

Result: 攻击使DNNs的预测准确率从99.90%降至10.6%，但提出的方法成功恢复至96.05%，检测模型识别攻击的成功率超过99%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在交通标志识别系统中采用先进的训练方法对抵御数据中毒攻击至关重要。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

*Yannis Spyridis,Vasileios Argyriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用RGB图像和深度学习技术（如迁移学习和基础模型）在自动化纺织品回收中实现分类和分割任务的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高纺织品回收的效率和可扩展性，解决从传感器数据中准确识别材料成分和检测污染物的挑战。

Method: 使用预训练架构（如EfficientNetB0）进行纺织品分类，结合Grounding DINO和Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行零样本特征分割。

Result: 分类任务达到81.25%准确率，分割任务mIoU为0.90。

Conclusion: RGB图像结合现代深度学习技术可用于自动化纺织品回收的关键分析步骤。

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of
textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and
detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper
investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing
modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present
computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a)
classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile
features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained
architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with
EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with
81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the
Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the
generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility
of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including
transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot
segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile
recycling pipelines.

### [8] [A Deep Learning Approach for Facial Attribute Manipulation and Reconstruction in Surveillance and Reconnaissance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06578)
*Anees Nashath Shaik,Barbara Villarini,Vasileios Argyriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据驱动平台，通过生成合成训练数据来解决人脸识别中的偏见问题，提升监控系统的准确性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监控系统因图像质量低和人脸识别模型存在肤色和遮挡偏见，导致识别效果不佳，主要原因是训练数据缺乏多样性。

Method: 利用深度学习的自动编码器和生成对抗网络（GANs）生成多样化高质量合成数据，并集成图像增强模块提升低分辨率或遮挡人脸的清晰度。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上的实验表明，该平台显著提升了训练数据的多样性和模型公平性。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了AI人脸分析的偏见，提高了监控系统在复杂环境中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but
their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos,
leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing
AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone
variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness
in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data
limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient
diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance.
To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances
surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to
compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based
facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality
facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement
module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in
surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset,
demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity
and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial
analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments,
leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

*Youssef Farah,Federico Paredes-Vallés,Guido De Croon,Muhammad Ahmed Humais,Hussain Sajwani,Yahya Zweiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EV-LayerSegNet是一种自监督CNN，用于事件相机的运动分割，通过分层场景动态表示学习光流和分割掩码，并利用去模糊质量作为自监督损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在运动任务中表现优异，但获取地面真实数据昂贵且困难，因此需要自监督方法。

Method: 提出EV-LayerSegNet，通过分层动态表示分别学习仿射光流和分割掩码，并利用去模糊质量作为自监督损失。

Result: 在仅含仿射运动的模拟数据集上，IoU和检测率分别达到71%和87%。

Conclusion: EV-LayerSegNet展示了自监督方法在事件相机运动分割中的潜力。

Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics
with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels
react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited
for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training
event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining
ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this
article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based
motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene
dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and
segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The
deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.
We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,
achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

### [10] [RARL: Improving Medical VLM Reasoning and Generalization with Reinforcement Learning and LoRA under Data and Hardware Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06600)
*Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RARL的推理感知强化学习框架，旨在提升医疗视觉语言模型（VLM）的推理能力，同时保持高效性和低资源适应性。实验表明，RARL在医疗图像分析和临床推理任务中表现优异，且计算资源需求较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗VLM在泛化性、透明性和计算效率方面存在局限，阻碍了其在资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Method: 采用低秩适应（Low-Rank Adaptation）和自定义奖励函数对轻量级基础模型Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct进行微调，结合诊断准确性和推理质量。训练在单块NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU上完成。

Result: RARL在推理任务中比监督微调性能提升约7.78%，在未见数据集上泛化能力提升27%，且计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 推理引导学习和推理提示技术可显著提升医疗VLM的透明度、准确性和资源效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical
applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However,
current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency,
and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world,
resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and
adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight
base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward
functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.
Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the
feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate
the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and
explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves
VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming
supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while
requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the
generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving
around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%
over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity
prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial
for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of
reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward
more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.
Code and data are publicly available.

### [11] [Zero Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06602)
*Santhosh Kakarla,Gautama Shastry Bulusu Venkata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过微调BLIP-2和轻量级Q-Former，将FashionIQ基准上的Recall@10提升至45.6%（衬衫）、40.1%（连衣裙）和50.4%（T恤），平均Recall@50达67.6%。Retrieval-DPO方法因缺乏多模态融合和高质量负样本，效果较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升零样本组合图像检索（CIR）的性能，解决现有方法在FashionIQ基准上Recall@10仅为20-25%的问题。

Method: 1. 微调BLIP-2，使用轻量级Q-Former融合视觉和文本特征；2. 尝试Retrieval-DPO方法，优化CLIP文本编码器。

Result: BLIP-2方法显著提升Recall@10和Recall@50；Retrieval-DPO因多模态融合不足和负样本质量低，效果不佳。

Conclusion: 有效的基于偏好的CIR需要多模态融合、排名感知目标和高质量负样本。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by
applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove
stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the
text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\%
Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2
with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a
single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and
50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also
examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct
Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite
extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy,
Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and
prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii)
uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on
low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen.
Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine
multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

TL;DR: PhysLab是一个针对教育场景的视频数据集，专注于复杂物理实验，提供多级注释以支持多种视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在注释粒度、领域覆盖和程序指导方面存在不足，限制了视觉解析的进展。

Method: 引入PhysLab数据集，包含620个长视频和四类代表性实验，提供多级注释。

Result: 建立了基线并进行了广泛评估，突出了教育视频解析中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: PhysLab有望推动细粒度视觉解析和智能课堂系统的发展。

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by
limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity,
which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2)
limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for
educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with
minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task
process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset
that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset
includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific
instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises
620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety
of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis,
etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to
highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We
expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained
visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering
closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The
dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at

TL;DR: 利用暗通道作为补充线索，从单张空间变异散焦模糊图像中估计场景深度，通过对抗性训练实现端到端深度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度估计方法通常依赖多张图像，而单张散焦图像的深度估计问题尚未充分解决。本文旨在通过暗通道先验和局部模糊与对比度变化的关系，提升单张图像的深度估计性能。

Method: 利用暗通道先验捕捉模糊图像的局部统计信息，结合局部散焦模糊与对比度变化的关系，通过对抗性训练实现端到端深度估计。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，暗通道先验的引入显著提升了单张散焦图像的深度估计效果。

Conclusion: 暗通道先验为单张散焦图像的深度估计提供了有效补充，验证了该方法的实用性。

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate
the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to
its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred
images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques
typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to
recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single
defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method
capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast
variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating
the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully
end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic
depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior
into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating
the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D高斯泼溅方法在稀疏单目输入下泛化能力差和优化时间长的问题。

Method: PGHM包含UV对齐的潜在身份图编码几何和外观，以及分离的多头U-Net预测高斯属性。

Result: PGHM仅需约20分钟即可生成视觉质量相当的化身，效率显著优于从头优化方法。

Conclusion: PGHM为实际单目化身创建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for
virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering
quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges,
including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under
sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human
Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human
priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from
monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent
identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance
into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that
predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and
view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust
rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing
efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long
optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient
than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes
per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby
demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar
creation.

Method: 结合SAR/InSAR、高分辨率光学底图和洪水风险层，采用多模态Mamba架构预测损坏状态、洪水范围和建筑轮廓。

Result: 在Hurricane Harvey数据上，F1分数比现有方法提升19个百分点，尤其在轻微和中度损坏分类中表现突出。

Conclusion: Flood-DamageSense通过风险感知建模和SAR全天候能力，提供更快、更精细的洪水损坏情报。

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life,
affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise
in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the
primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address
the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic
in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented
reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or
video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation
and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years,
numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly
based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures,
loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper
presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and
video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that
existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in
capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that
comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected
under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure
settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional
benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization
capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on
both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising
directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation
metrics introduced in this work are publicly available and will be regularly
updated. Project page: https://github.com/nqian1/Survey-on-ODISR-and-ODVSR.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于双曲平均曲率流的主动轮廓模型（HMCF-ACMs）和双模式正则化流驱动的主动轮廓模型（HDRF-ACMs），通过可调初始速度场和边缘感知力调制，提升了图像分割的精度和抗噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的抛物线平均曲率流驱动的主动轮廓模型（PMCF-ACMs）对初始曲线配置依赖性强，限制了其适应性和性能。本文旨在通过引入双曲平均曲率流和正则化技术，解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 提出HMCF-ACMs，引入可调初始速度场；2. 证明HMCF-ACMs是法向流，并通过水平集方法建立数值等价性；3. 开发HDRF-ACMs，利用平滑Heaviside函数抑制弱边界处的过度扩散；4. 优化加权四阶Runge-Kutta算法求解波方程。

Conclusion: HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs通过任务自适应的初始配置，显著提升了图像分割的性能，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are
widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the
selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose
several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce
tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse
segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows
and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations
and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance
function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic
dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth
Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion
near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta
algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the
above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and
HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise
resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of
initial velocities and initial contours.

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters
between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying
individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five
African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species.
The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a
closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their
predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To
this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric
contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and
projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare
our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show
feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying
classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features
achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the
best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉和语言结合方面取得了显著成功，但仍存在输出与图像内容不符的幻觉问题，需要一种简单有效的方法来缓解。

Method: 引入Local Perception Search (LPS)，一种在推理过程中利用局部视觉先验信息作为价值函数来修正解码过程的方法。

Result: 在广泛使用的幻觉基准测试和噪声数据上，LPS显著减少了幻觉现象，尤其在噪声环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: LPS是一种即插即用的方法，能有效抑制多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象，尤其在噪声场景下效果显著。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为SAR图像的高级信息检索提供了新思路，展示了结构建模在语义信息提取中的潜力。

Abstract: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms
for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information
retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local
geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural
modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:
SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target
and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry
and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural
consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed
in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of
target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a
two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.
Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real
SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical
structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are
integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results
validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time,
that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly
derived from a single-view SAR image.

Result: LitMAS仅需6M参数，在七个数据集上的平均EER比现有方法高1.36%，表现出高效性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LitMAS是一种高效、通用的多模态反欺骗解决方案，适合边缘部署。

Abstract: Biometric authentication systems are increasingly being deployed in critical
applications, but they remain susceptible to spoofing. Since most of the
research efforts focus on modality-specific anti-spoofing techniques, building
a unified, resource-efficient solution across multiple biometric modalities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose LitMAS, a
$\textbf{Li}$gh$\textbf{t}$ weight and generalizable $\textbf{M}$ulti-modal
$\textbf{A}$nti-$\textbf{S}$poofing framework designed to detect spoofing
attacks in speech, face, iris, and fingerprint-based biometric systems. At the
core of LitMAS is a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss, which enhances
inter-class separability while preserving cross-modal consistency and enabling
robust spoof detection across diverse biometric traits. With just 6M
parameters, LitMAS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by $1.36\%$ in average
EER across seven datasets, demonstrating high efficiency, strong
generalizability, and suitability for edge deployment. Code and trained models

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term
forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object
dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格迁移技术在保持身份和高质量风格化之间存在矛盾，尤其是在小面部或远距离拍摄的图像中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高风格保真度和身份完整性方面显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或微调，适用于复杂场景和小面部图像。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities,
existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while
achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for
images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances,
frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we
introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized
image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the
"Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity
retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content
consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details
by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our
experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the
baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust
identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or
significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model
retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RDVP-MSD无需训练即可显著提升分割准确性和效率，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for
various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each
object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims
to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic
prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to
Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical
issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text
prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic
captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)
\textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in
getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global
background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,
causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we
propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework
that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream
\textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal
\textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT
progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity,
while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently
samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively
mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any
training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation
result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than
previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Result: 实验表明Hi-LSplat在开放词汇分割和定位中表现优异，尤其在层次语义数据集上。

Conclusion: Hi-LSplat能够有效捕捉3D场景中的复杂层次语义，解决了视图一致性和语义一致性问题。

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language
queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based
models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but
lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies.
Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in
object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic
understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent
Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying.
To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features
to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered
instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D
semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise
contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations.
Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the
model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments
highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and
localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets
underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D
scenes.

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown
its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP
from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the
scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be
successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between
robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process?
If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to
mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three
questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To
mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt
Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally
compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of
robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly
enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are
universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种注意力级别控制方法，用于耦合图像生成任务，确保背景相似的同时保持中心对象的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多图像生成中背景耦合与对象灵活性的平衡问题。

Method: 通过解耦背景和实体组件，并引入时间变化的权重控制参数进行优化。

Result: 在背景耦合、文本对齐和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了背景耦合与对象灵活性的统一。

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image
generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images
are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds
coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to
enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method
disentangles the background and entity components in the model's
cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight
control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this
sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses
how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall
visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches across these criteria.

Conclusion: EndoARSS有望推动AI驱动的内窥镜手术系统发展，提升手术安全与效率。

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally
invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection
and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes,
characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and
confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges
for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often
struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in
each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task
learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance
overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel
multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery
activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2
foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate
efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank
Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we
introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature
representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global
information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we
present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored
for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity
recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks,
significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing
models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven
endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical
safety and efficiency.

*Zelin He,Sarah Alnegheimish,Matthew Reimherr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的两阶段时间序列异常检测方法，结合视觉筛选和VLM推理，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏视觉-时间推理能力，无法像人类专家那样识别上下文异常。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：ViT4TS（视觉筛选）和VLM4TS（VLM推理），结合2D时间序列表示和全局时间上下文。

Result: VLM4TS在未进行时间序列训练的情况下，F1-max分数比最佳基线提升24.6%，且效率更高。

Conclusion: VLM方法在时间序列异常检测中表现出色，兼具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of
fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior
methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，对3D场景进行艺术风格化以匹配参考图像的需求增长，但现有方法在适配多风格和保持内存效率方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用二分匹配机制自动识别风格图像与渲染图像局部区域的对应关系，提出语义风格损失函数和局部-全局特征匹配以增强多视角一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成合理的风格化结果和提供灵活编辑方面优于现有方法，同时实现了内存高效训练和更好的纹理细节。

Conclusion: Multi-StyleGS通过创新的语义风格损失和局部-全局匹配机制，有效解决了3D GS风格化的挑战，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene
to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes.
While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method
for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to
stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style
transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for
stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization
solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we
employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify
correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered
images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style
loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to
various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to
enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve
memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To
better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several
techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our
comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing
plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

Result: Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick方法误差最低（7.96），接近现有最优融合滤波器。

Conclusion: 神经网络可用于高效姿态估计，性能接近传统复杂方法。

Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention
due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint
estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads
to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens
Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract
the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose
estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network
architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can
estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda)
Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method
was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle
distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was
conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation,
window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error.
This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose,
with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于位置预测的自监督学习方法（LOCA），用于多模态卫星图像语义分割，显著优于现有的基于重建的自监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像的语义分割对地球观测应用至关重要，但受限于标记训练数据的不足。现有方法（如MAE）侧重于重建而非定位，而定位是分割任务的基础。

Method: 扩展SatMAE的通道分组至多模态数据，引入同组注意力掩码以促进跨模态交互，采用相对补丁位置预测任务以增强空间推理能力。

Result: 在Sen1Floods11洪水测绘数据集上，该方法显著优于基于重建的自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 针对多模态卫星图像的位置预测任务能学习到更有效的表示，优于基于重建的方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation
applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While
self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown
promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental
aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a
position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite
imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of
satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to
multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and
introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction
during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction,
encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it
significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised
learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position
prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn
representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than
reconstruction-based approaches.

Result: 在Argoverse 2单代理运动预测基准上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 仅解码器模型在轨迹预测中表现更优，未来可进一步探索多代理场景。

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for
autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by
the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a
Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing
encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and
predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the
model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that
the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the
performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language
modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the
auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This
allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the
performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach
outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art
results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Result: 在Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark上实现了5%的性能提升，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: Vision-EKIPL克服了传统强化学习方法的局限性，显著提升了视觉推理性能，为该领域研究提供了新范式。

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and
advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the
reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through
Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL
approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which
limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to
inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in
introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during
the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The
policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly
expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning
boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and
efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL
achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark
compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can
overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the
visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for
research in this field.

Method: 设计了基于条件生成对抗网络（cGAN-TOP）的去噪模块和动态图卷积神经网络（LDGCNN）的识别模块。

Result: 在Bosphorus数据集上验证，所有噪声设置下识别精度显著提升，最高增益达14.81%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了噪声点云下的3D人脸识别问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw
point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect
sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point
cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and
recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the
noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent
recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is
then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which
hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of
multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It
significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with
a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Abstract: Accurate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is vital for early

Motivation: 现有模型仅在视觉图像重建上表现良好，但心理图像重建在医学和脑机接口应用中更为关键。

Method: 通过NSD-Imagery评估多个NSD训练的视觉解码模型（如MindEye1、Brain Diffuser等）在心理图像上的表现。

Result: 心理图像解码性能与视觉重建性能脱钩，简单线性架构和多模态特征解码表现更好。

Conclusion: 心理图像数据集对实际应用至关重要，NSD-Imagery为视觉解码方法的优化提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在3D点云数据分析中表现出色，但对对抗攻击（如点丢弃、移动和添加）的脆弱性威胁了3D视觉系统的可靠性。

Method: 基于流形假设和特征空间中的最近邻搜索，KNN-Defense通过语义相似性恢复受扰动的输入，而非重建表面几何或强制均匀点分布。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，KNN-Defense显著提升了对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，特别是在点丢弃攻击下，对PointNet等模型的准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: KNN-Defense为增强3D点云分类器的对抗鲁棒性提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge
to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the
semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing
defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named
KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and
nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface
geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores
perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples
from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally
efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and
practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset
demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various
attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing
methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the
proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on
PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that
KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the
adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source
implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯泼溅技术在静态场景中表现优异，但在长期动态场景（场景在视野外变化）中表现不足，亟需改进。

Method: 引入动态场景适应机制持续更新3D表示，并提出关键帧管理机制以保持几何和语义一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上评估，GaME方法比现有技术更准确。

Conclusion: GaME方法有效解决了长期动态场景的挑战，提升了3D高斯泼溅技术的实用性。

Abstract: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used
in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving
applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS
performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes.
While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within
the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes
out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D
representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining
geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale
observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe
management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as
much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes
(GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more
accurate than the state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PSG依赖EEG，复杂且不便，研究探索了PSM和EOG作为替代方案。

Method: 使用ImageBind模型整合PSM和双通道EOG信号，首次融合这两种数据。

Result: 模型在未微调时表现良好，微调后显著优于现有单模态或多模态方法。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态模型可有效用于睡眠分类，接近依赖EEG的系统性能。

Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep
disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography
(PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its
complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring
challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of
electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive
alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a
novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning
model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage
classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and
EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate
that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy,
outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet),
exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches
(MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning,
highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data,
making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our
method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings
suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally
developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep
staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

Abstract: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the
environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and
the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense
images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption,
consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially
relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this
work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the
event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting
the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed
method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and
leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our
results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where
RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a
wearable RGB camera.

TL;DR: 研究发现，仅通过图像训练的Video LLMs在时间推理能力上表现优于预期，而视频训练的改进效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Video LLMs在时间推理上的能力，尤其是图像训练与视频训练的效果差异。

Method: 使用LongVU算法训练的两个LLMs，并在TVBench上进行测试；引入基于图像序列和问题的微调方案。

Result: 图像训练的LLMs在时间推理任务上表现显著高于随机水平，且接近或超过视频训练的LLMs。

Conclusion: 当前视频训练方案未充分利用时间特征，需进一步研究图像训练LLMs的时间推理机制及视频训练的瓶颈。

Abstract: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with
numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these
models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both
image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings
indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after
image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from
video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that
image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm
perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning
benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving
sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities.
This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and
occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests
suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current
models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow
image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the
bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

*Mellon M. Zhang,Glen Chou,Saibal Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHiM是一种新型状态空间模型，专为极坐标流式LiDAR设计，通过局部双向Mamba块和全局前向Mamba块实现高效检测，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要低延迟、高吞吐的实时感知，传统方法处理全扫描LiDAR数据延迟高，流式方法因极坐标几何与卷积不匹配导致性能下降。

Method: PHiM采用局部双向Mamba块进行空间编码和全局前向Mamba块进行时间建模，替代卷积和位置编码，实现失真感知操作。

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上，PHiM性能优于之前最佳流式检测器10%，吞吐量翻倍。

Conclusion: PHiM为极坐标流式LiDAR提供了一种高效解决方案，性能与全扫描基线相当，代码将开源。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be
available at https://github.com/meilongzhang/Polar-Hierarchical-Mamba .

Method: 基于预训练视觉语言模型，引入分层时间步专家流架构和残差注意力机制，提高生成效率。

Result: 在多模态理解任务中表现优异，图像生成质量竞争性且推理速度快6倍。

Conclusion: LaTtE-Flow为多模态任务提供了一种高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding
and generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of
vision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing
unified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve
the same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task.
Additionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds,
limiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based
Transformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image
understanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow
builds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong
multimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise
Timestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation.
LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of
Transformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This
design significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small
subset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we
propose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient
information reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow
achieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving
competitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed
compared to recent unified multimodal models.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在模拟数据集上表现良好，但在真实场景（如文档扫描）中泛化能力不足，需解决复杂退化和语义变化问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在模拟和真实文档数据集上提升了文本检测性能（IoU指标），同时保持了图像保真度。

Conclusion: 多目标优化有助于缩小模拟训练与真实部署之间的差距，提升超分辨率模型在实际场景中的应用价值。

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a
high-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent
deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated
datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling
high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world
settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations
and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task
learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically
optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate
auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text
detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a
convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,
and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic
weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of
each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon
the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for
single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and
real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while
preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of
multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap
between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: AR-RAG是一种通过自回归方式在图像生成过程中动态检索并融合相关视觉参考的新方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成前进行静态检索，可能导致过度复制或风格偏差，AR-RAG旨在通过动态检索提升生成质量。

Method: 提出两种框架：DAiD（直接合并预测与检索分布）和FAiD（通过多尺度卷积平滑检索特征）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有图像生成模型。

Conclusion: AR-RAG通过动态检索和融合机制有效提升了图像生成的灵活性和质量。

Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm
that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest
neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a
single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation
on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each
generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and
incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model
to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g.,
over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize
AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in
Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly
merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of
retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features
of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them
to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of
AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and
DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
image generation models.

Motivation: 现有手语数据集覆盖不全且多为单视角，难以应对手部遮挡问题，因此需要构建更全面的双视角数据集。

Method: 提出双视角手语数据集NationalCSL-DP，并设计CNN-Transformer网络及简单有效的融合策略。

Result: 实验表明融合策略显著提升识别性能，但序列到序列模型难以从双视角视频中学习互补特征。

Conclusion: 双视角数据集和融合策略有效，但需进一步优化模型以更好地利用双视角信息。

Abstract: Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language
recognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition,
the development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for
this breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the
real world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign
vocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view
RGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing
ISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset
for ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign
language vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten
signers with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left
side. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong
baseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.
Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets
as well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can
significantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the
sequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or
late-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the
sign videos of two vertical views.

Motivation: CLIP在多模态检索中存在模态鸿沟问题，而现有MLLM虽具备对齐能力，但机制较粗糙。MAPLE旨在利用MLLM的细粒度对齐先验优化跨模态表示学习。

Method: 提出MAPLE框架，包含自动偏好数据构建和RPA损失函数，将学习过程建模为强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，MAPLE在细粒度跨模态检索中取得显著提升。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过偏好引导的对齐机制，有效解决了跨模态检索中的细粒度语义对齐问题。

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability
to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in
its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs
(Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality
alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified
architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality
alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We
introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel
framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to
guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning
process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic
preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative
Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our
preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained
cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced
semantic distinctions.

Conclusion: 混合表示方法在室内场景中实现了高效且高质量的渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in
image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with
complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color
variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address
this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that
combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle
texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate
geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted
mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint
optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and
transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions
seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation
maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second
FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.

Motivation: 理解Vision Transformers（ViTs）的特性与机制需要有效的对抗样本，但现有方法因过拟合导致迁移性不足。

Method: COGO包含共性增强（CE）和个体抑制（IS）两部分：CE扰动中低频区域，IS通过自适应阈值评估梯度相关性。

Result: 实验表明，COGO显著提升了对抗攻击的迁移成功率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COGO通过优化共性信息与抑制个体特征，为提升对抗样本迁移性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for
understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs).
However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit
weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods
improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform
gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully
leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the
same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing
perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing
those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve
transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient
optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality
Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low
frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset
tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS
employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated
gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer
success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Dual-camera super-resolution is highly practical for smartphone photography
that primarily super-resolve the wide-angle images using the telephoto image as

To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded
domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs
corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency
structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching
module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple
receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also
introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and
inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results
on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，推理速度与最新高效方法相当。

Conclusion: BePo通过结合BEV和稀疏点表示，有效解决了小物体和大物体的3D占用预测问题。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover,
BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest
efficient approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法（如MPGD）在去噪步骤中仅应用单次梯度更新，限制了恢复的保真度和鲁棒性，尤其是在嵌入式或分布外场景中。

Method: 在去噪的每个时间步中引入多步优化策略，增加梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: MPGD可作为轻量级、即插即用的恢复模块，适用于无人机和移动机器人等实时视觉感知任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin
Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally
trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes.
Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play
restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such
as drones and mobile robots.

Abstract: This work presents UNO, a unified monocular visual odometry framework that
enables robust and adaptable pose estimation across diverse environments,

deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach
generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including
autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, mobile robots, and handheld devices. To
this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state
estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class
of ego-motion patterns. Moreover, we introduce a fully differentiable
Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph,
selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues
are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained,
scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to
enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three
major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV

Conclusion: 分层评分范式显著提升了导航效率和准确性。

Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify
and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image
captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view
synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or
trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues.
This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping
image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing
both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN
framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal
viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic
scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high
semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local
geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising
regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world
applicability.

Our approach formulates row and column splitting as sequence labeling tasks,
utilizing dual Transformer encoders to capture feature interactions. The
merging process is framed as a grid cell classification task, leveraging an

in real-world applications. Our method offers a robust, scalable, and efficient
solution for large-scale table recognition, making it well-suited for
industrial deployment.

Motivation: 现有视频问答基准局限于单一视频片段，无法满足实际应用中大规模音频-视觉检索和复杂推理的需求。

Method: 提出AVHaystacks基准和MAGNET多智能体框架，并引入STEM和MTGS指标。

Result: MAGNET在BLEU@4和GPT评分上分别提升89%和65%。

Conclusion: AVHaystacks和MAGNET为多视频检索和时序定位提供了有效解决方案和新评估标准。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual
understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex
reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video
question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per
query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale,
audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal
is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query
and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we
present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA
pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and
temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent
framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65%
relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores
in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of
multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation,
we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a
ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and
interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance. Project:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的方法，用于检测AI生成图像并提供可解释的视觉定位和文本解释。通过构建标注数据集和多阶段优化策略，显著提升了检测性能和解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测方法多为黑箱，缺乏可解释性；MLLM虽具备分析能力，但在视觉与文本对齐上存在不足。

Method: 构建标注数据集，通过多阶段优化策略微调MLLM，平衡检测、定位和解释目标。

Result: 模型在检测和定位AI生成图像方面表现优异，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI生成图像的检测和解释提供了有效解决方案，未来可进一步优化对齐能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PRE-Net的两阶段模型，通过多模态知识扩展技术提升红外降水反演的准确性，解决了现有方法的范围限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外降水反演算法精度低，而被动微波和雷达方法范围有限，因此需要一种能在全盘范围内实现高精度降水反演的技术。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) Swath-Distilling阶段，通过CoMWE技术将多模态知识迁移到红外模型；2) Full-Disc Adaptation阶段，利用Self-MaskTune平衡多模态和红外知识。

Result: PRE-Net在PRE基准测试中显著优于PERSIANN-CCS、PDIR和IMERG等领先产品。

Conclusion: PRE-Net通过多模态知识扩展实现了高精度的全盘降水反演，为卫星降水反演提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by
satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low
accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive
microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This
challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which
aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals
beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a
two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling
stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to
an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and
Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune
refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc
infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate
that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance,
outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code
will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖局部特征，缺乏发现更丰富语义先验的能力。

Method: LogoSP通过频域中的全局模式分组超点，生成语义伪标签用于训练分割网络。

Result: 在两个室内和一个室外数据集上，LogoSP显著优于现有无监督方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogoSP证明了在无人类标注的情况下，全局模式能有效表示有意义的3D语义。

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point
clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually
formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework
for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely
on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and
enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method
achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD
method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on
ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under
few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model
generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized
teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary
classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes
our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable
low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our
framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical
environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates
the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory
data under weak supervision.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂物理运动或边界时表现不佳，且依赖物体先验信息（如掩码或类型）。FreeGave旨在解决这些问题。

Conclusion: FreeGave成功学习了无标签的3D物理运动模式，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

Motivation: 现有方法在目标模型的损失函数引导和对抗样本生成方面存在不足，需要改进。

Result: 在多个基准数据库和模型上实验表明，D2R Loss与CAG结合能显著提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D2R Loss和CAG策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要完整3D模型或大量参考图像，而部分参考数据下的姿态估计仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于有限RGBD图像或单张2D图像初始化部分3D模型，并引入不确定性区分已知与未知区域，指导在线补全。

Result: 在YCB-Video等数据集上表现优于现有方法，特别是在不完整观测下。

Conclusion: UA-Pose通过不确定性建模和在线补全，显著提升了部分参考数据下的6D姿态估计性能。

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.
However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed
3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating
6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's
appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose
UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online
object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume
access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a
single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model
based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use
image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method
integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between
seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose
estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object
completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving
object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and
HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots
and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are
incomplete or partially captured. Project page:

Abstract: The growing availability of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) data enables
accurate global land cover and crop type monitoring. However, the volume and
heterogeneity of these datasets pose major processing and annotation
challenges. To address this, the French National Institute of Geographical and
Forest Information (IGN) is actively exploring innovative strategies to exploit
diverse EO data, which require large annotated datasets. IGN introduces
FLAIR-HUB, the largest multi-sensor land cover dataset with
very-high-resolution (20 cm) annotations, covering 2528 km2 of France. It
combines six aligned modalities: aerial imagery, Sentinel-1/2 time series, SPOT
imagery, topographic data, and historical aerial images. Extensive benchmarks
evaluate multimodal fusion and deep learning models (CNNs, transformers) for
land cover or crop mapping and also explore multi-task learning. Results
underscore the complexity of multimodal fusion and fine-grained classification,
with best land cover performance (78.2% accuracy, 65.8% mIoU) achieved using
nearly all modalities. FLAIR-HUB supports supervised and multimodal
pretraining, with data and code available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能优异，甚至超过部分全监督方法。

Conclusion: UCOD-DPL通过动态伪标签学习和多模块协作，显著提升了无监督伪装目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it
doesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods
typically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1
convolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared
to fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:
1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label
containing substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn
the semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized
objects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between
foreground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a
teacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,
which contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial
(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines
pseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent
the model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for
self-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different
segmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background
confusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human
tendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on
small-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates
outstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised
methods. The code is available now.

Conclusion: SceneLCM通过结合LLM和LCM，实现了高效、高质量的室内场景生成与编辑。

Abstract: Our project page: https://scutyklin.github.io/SceneLCM/. Automated generation
of complex, interactive indoor scenes tailored to user prompt remains a
formidable challenge. While existing methods achieve indoor scene synthesis,
they struggle with rigid editing constraints, physical incoherence, excessive
human effort, single-room limitations, and suboptimal material quality. To
address these limitations, we propose SceneLCM, an end-to-end framework that
synergizes Large Language Model (LLM) for layout design with Latent Consistency
Model(LCM) for scene optimization. Our approach decomposes scene generation
into four modular pipelines: (1) Layout Generation. We employ LLM-guided 3D
spatial reasoning to convert textual descriptions into parametric blueprints(3D
layout). And an iterative programmatic validation mechanism iteratively refines
layout parameters through LLM-mediated dialogue loops; (2) Furniture
Generation. SceneLCM employs Consistency Trajectory Sampling(CTS), a
consistency distillation sampling loss guided by LCM, to form fast,
semantically rich, and high-quality representations. We also offer two
theoretical justification to demonstrate that our CTS loss is equivalent to
consistency loss and its distillation error is bounded by the truncation error
of the Euler solver; (3) Environment Optimization. We use a multiresolution
texture field to encode the appearance of the scene, and optimize via CTS loss.
To maintain cross-geometric texture coherence, we introduce a normal-aware
cross-attention decoder to predict RGB by cross-attending to the anchors
locations in geometrically heterogeneous instance. (4)Physically Editing.
SceneLCM supports physically editing by integrating physical simulation,
achieved persistent physical realism. Extensive experiments validate SceneLCM's
superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, showing its wide-ranging
potential for diverse applications.

Conclusion: EdgeSpotter方法在工业面板监测任务中实现了准确和鲁棒的文本检测，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Text spotting for industrial panels is a key task for intelligent monitoring.
However, achieving efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial
panels remains challenging due to issues such as cross-scale localization and
ambiguous boundaries in dense text regions. Moreover, most existing methods
primarily focus on representing a single text shape, neglecting a comprehensive
exploration of multi-scale feature information across different texts. To
address these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter
for edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust
industrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient
mixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features,
integrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature
sampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the
shape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed
detections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text
regions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring
(IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
this challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the
proposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally,
practical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system
demonstrate the practicality of the method. The code and demo will be available

*Huaize Liu,Wenzhang Sun,Qiyuan Zhang,Donglin Di,Biao Gong,Hao Li,Chen Wei,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-VAE是一种高效的视频自编码框架，通过分层编码视频动态的粗到细运动表示，显著减少冗余，实现高压缩比和高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频自编码方法未能高效建模动态中的时空冗余，导致压缩效果不佳和训练成本高。

Method: Hi-VAE将视频动态分解为全局运动和细节运动两个潜在空间，使用自监督运动编码器压缩表示，并通过条件扩散解码器重建视频。

Result: 实验表明，Hi-VAE的压缩比高达1428倍，远超基线方法（如Cosmos-VAE的48倍），同时保持高质量重建。

Conclusion: Hi-VAE在高效压缩和高质量重建方面表现出色，具有可解释性和可扩展性，为视频潜在表示和生成提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video
generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal
redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This
shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address
this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that
hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics
and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task.
Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global
Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding
high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders,
we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce
redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs
videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling
high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$
higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the
efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction
quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream
generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability,
providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent
representation and generation.

### [77] [Learning Compact Vision Tokens for Efficient Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07138)
*Hao Tang,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种空间令牌融合（STF）和多块令牌融合（MBTF）方法，以减少视觉令牌序列长度并提升推理效率，同时保持多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）因计算成本高和视觉令牌序列处理复杂度高而面临挑战，需要减少冗余令牌并提升效率。

Method: 通过STF融合空间相邻令牌以减少序列长度，并通过MBTF补充多粒度特征以平衡信息保留。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仅使用25%视觉令牌的情况下，在8个基准测试中性能与基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: STF和MBTF的结合有效提升了推理效率，同时保持了多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The

*Van Nguyen Nguyen,Christian Forster,Sindi Shkodrani,Vincent Lepetit,Bugra Tekin,Cem Keskin,Tomas Hodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoTrack是一种基于CAD的高效6DoF物体姿态优化与跟踪方法，无需对象特定训练，结合了模型到帧和帧到帧的注册。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪方法仅依赖分析-合成方法进行模型到帧注册，GoTrack通过结合帧到帧注册节省计算并稳定跟踪。

Method: 利用光流估计实现两种注册：模型到帧注册使用标准神经网络块（基于DINOv2的Transformer），帧到帧注册使用轻量级现成光流模型。

Result: GoTrack与现有粗姿态估计方法结合，在标准6DoF姿态估计与跟踪基准测试中达到RGB-only的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: GoTrack提供了一种高效、准确的姿态优化与跟踪方法，适用于多样化对象，且无需特定训练。

Abstract: We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF
object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without
any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely
on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack
additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and
stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow
estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in
existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer
is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores
without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an
easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we
employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack
can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to
create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on
standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source
code and trained models are publicly available at

### [79] [Faster than Fast: Accelerating Oriented FAST Feature Detection on Low-end Embedded GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07164)
*Qiong Chang,Xinyuan Chen,Xiang Li,Weimin Wang,Jun Miyazaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种方法，用于在低端嵌入式GPU上加速Oriented FAST特征检测，显著提升了SLAM系统的实时处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Oriented FAST计算耗时占整个SLAM系统的一半，现有ORB-based SLAM系统在移动平台上难以满足实时处理需求。

Method: 通过二进制级编码策略快速确定候选点，以及利用高效的低级GPU硬件特定指令实现可分离的Harris角点检测策略。

Result: 在Jetson TX2嵌入式GPU上的实验表明，相比广泛使用的OpenCV（支持GPU），平均加速超过7.3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了处理速度，展示了在移动和资源受限环境中实时应用的潜力。

Abstract: The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology
widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality,
which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to
construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own
location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power
consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST
and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in
terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of
meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This
limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations
accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper
presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on
low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in
Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner
detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy
to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy
with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive
experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over
7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant
improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time
applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖微调大规模视频模型，随着模型规模增长变得不切实际，因此需要一种无需训练的可控视频生成方法。

Method: 提出Frame Guidance，基于帧级信号（如关键帧、风格参考图等），采用简单的潜在处理方法减少内存，并设计新的潜在优化策略以实现全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明，Frame Guidance能高效生成高质量可控视频，适用于多种任务和输入信号。

Conclusion: Frame Guidance是一种无需训练、兼容性强且高效的可控视频生成方法。

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality,
directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing
methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks,
which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this
work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable
video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style
reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free
guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically
reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed
for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective
control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and
looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental
results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for
a wide range of tasks and input signals.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分层解耦的后训练框架，通过重构中间特征图引入代理监督信号，提升模型透明度和训练灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端自动驾驶模型中黑箱特性带来的可解释性和安全性问题。

Method: 利用真实标签重构中间特征图，将特征级反向计算形式化为优化问题（线性方程组或最小二乘问题），实现独立组件训练。

Result: 在多个标准图像分类基准测试中表现出优越的泛化性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络训练提供了新的高效范式，验证了其有效性和潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a dominant paradigm, yet its
highly entangled black-box models pose significant challenges in terms of
interpretability and safety assurance. To improve model transparency and
training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled
post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By
reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate
supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent
training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling
of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights
into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed
optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear
equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient
training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature
backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to
traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了SAP-Bench数据集和MLLM-SAP框架，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在手术动作规划任务中的表现，揭示了当前模型的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估手术决策任务中对原子视觉动作的区分和复杂长期程序的协调能力，因此需要高质量数据集和评估方法。

Method: 通过构建SAP-Bench数据集（包含1,226个临床验证的手术动作片段）和提出MLLM-SAP框架，利用MLLMs生成手术场景中的下一步动作推荐。

Result: 评估了七种先进MLLMs，发现它们在下一步动作预测任务中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: SAP-Bench和MLLM-SAP为手术动作规划任务提供了有效的评估工具，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction
performance.

TL;DR: TV-LiVE是一种无需训练、基于文本引导的视频编辑框架，通过利用关键层信息实现复杂编辑任务，如添加新对象和非刚性变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法主要关注简单任务（如风格迁移、背景替换），而复杂任务（如添加新对象和非刚性变换）研究较少。TV-LiVE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过识别视频生成模型中的关键层（与RoPE相关），选择性注入源模型的特征到目标模型，实现对象添加和非刚性编辑。

Result: 实验表明，TV-LiVE在对象添加和非刚性编辑任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TV-LiVE为复杂视频编辑任务提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress
of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements,
there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video
editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused
on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,
and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the
source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel
objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this
paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing
framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify
vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the
quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method
enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively
injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding
layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,
we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding
to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the
prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental
results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both
object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page:

*Zhiyuan Zhong,Zhen Sun,Yepang Liu,Xinlei He,Guanhong Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的跨模态后门攻击方法BadSem，利用图像-文本语义不匹配作为隐式触发器，攻击视觉语言模型（VLMs）。实验表明其攻击成功率高达98%，且现有防御方法难以应对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击主要依赖单模态触发器，忽略了VLMs的跨模态融合特性，因此研究跨模态语义不匹配作为触发器的攻击方法具有重要意义。

Method: 提出BadSem攻击方法，通过故意在训练时错配图像-文本对（如颜色和物体属性）植入后门，并构建SIMBad数据集支持攻击。

Result: 在四种主流VLMs上，BadSem平均攻击成功率（ASR）超过98%，且能泛化到分布外数据。可视化分析显示后门模型在语义敏感区域异常聚焦。

Conclusion: BadSem揭示了VLMs的语义漏洞，现有防御方法无效，亟需研究更安全的跨模态模型部署方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also
vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's
outputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on
single-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs
largely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that
leverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this
insight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data
poisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning
image-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a
dataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object
attributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem
achieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution
datasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis
using attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on
semantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining
normal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense
strategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both
of them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the
urgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer
deployment.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial technique in deep learning, particularly for
tasks with limited dataset diversity, such as skeleton-based datasets. This
paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates
geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and
intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to
simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of
spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias
and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions
for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data
set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed
augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR
point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments
are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB.
The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture
recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best
performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition.
DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action
recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB).
The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed
augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and
robustness across diverse datasets and architectures. This framework not only
establishes state-of-the-art results on all three evaluated models but also
offers a scalable solution to advance HGR and action recognition applications
in real-world scenarios. The framework is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在细粒度视觉差异任务中表现不佳的解决方案，通过构建微编辑数据集（MED）和引入特征级一致性损失的监督微调框架，显著提升了模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但在细粒度视觉差异（如属性、数量、位置等）上容易产生幻觉或遗漏语义变化，这主要源于训练数据和目标函数的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种可控数据生成流程，构建了包含50K图像-文本对的微编辑数据集（MED），并设计了基于特征级一致性损失的监督微调框架。

Result: 在微编辑检测基准测试中，该方法显著提升了差异检测准确性并减少了幻觉，同时在标准视觉语言任务（如图像描述和视觉问答）中表现一致优于基线模型（如GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: 通过结合针对性数据和目标对齐，可以有效增强MLLMs在细粒度视觉推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs采用静态推理范式，限制了其动态适应和迭代优化的能力，与人类感知的动态性不符。

Method: 提出基于马尔可夫决策过程的框架，结合推理器和验证器，通过多步直接偏好优化（DPO）训练验证器。

Result: 方法在多个视觉推理基准上显著优于现有方法，提高了准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 动态推理机制为下一代MLLMs实现细粒度、上下文感知的视觉推理提供了潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

Result: 模型在低层视觉任务（如分割、姿态估计）和高层推理任务（如ARC-AGI）中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VDMs不仅是生成引擎，还是适应性强的视觉学习器，有望成为未来视觉基础模型的核心。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools,
capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their
potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training
dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally
pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit
understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal
knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs
for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task
into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short
input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen
VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization
across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose
estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results
reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual
learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation
models in vision.

Method: 数据集包含多样化的低分辨率视频，任务包括人脸匹配和车牌识别，评估指标基于身份正确性和字符级准确性。

Result: 基线方法在两项任务中分别得分为0.58和0.42，表明任务可行但具挑战性。

Conclusion: FANVID旨在推动低分辨率视频时序建模的创新，适用于监控、法医和自动驾驶领域。

Abstract: Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable
in individual low-resolution (LR) frames, hindering reliable identification. To
advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based
benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63
identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each
video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and
realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and
labels.
  FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and
matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition --
extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are
downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are
indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal
information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average
Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and
character-level accuracy for text.
  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and
recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate
recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks.
FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition
challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and
annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze
innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in
surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

TL;DR: AllTracker是一种通过估计查询帧与视频中其他帧之间的流场来估计长距离点轨迹的模型，提供高分辨率和密集（全像素）的对应字段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点跟踪方法无法提供高分辨率和密集对应字段，而现有光流方法仅能对应下一帧。AllTracker旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合光流和点跟踪技术，采用低分辨率网格的迭代推断，通过2D卷积层和像素对齐注意力层分别进行空间和时间信息传播。

Result: 模型参数高效（1600万参数），在768x1024像素分辨率下实现最先进的点跟踪精度，并在40G GPU上运行快速。

Conclusion: AllTracker通过结合光流和点跟踪技术，实现了高效、高精度的长距离点跟踪，且训练数据集的多样性对性能至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by
way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of
a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers
high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be
visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach
corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the
next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques
from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs
iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates,
propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating
information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast
and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art
point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on
a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train on a wider set of
datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide
an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe,
making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are
available at https://alltracker.github.io .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性方法在可视化模型预测时被广泛使用，但其视觉合理性可能掩盖了关键局限性，尤其是对类别标签的敏感性不足。

Method: 提出了一种诊断测试（class sensitivity），并通过实验验证了许多显著性方法的类别不敏感性。随后提出了对比性解释方法CASE，通过隔离对预测类别唯一具有区分性的特征来生成解释。

Result: 实验表明，许多显著性方法对类别标签不敏感，而CASE在诊断测试和基于扰动的保真度测试中表现更优，能生成更忠实且类别特定的解释。

Conclusion: 显著性方法的类别不敏感性是一个普遍问题，而CASE通过对比性解释提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合TPS和CBAM的改进YOLO模型（CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO），用于解决农业场景中目标检测的遮挡和非刚性变形问题，显著提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业目标检测中，遮挡、不规则结构和背景噪声导致传统模型（如YOLO）性能下降。STN的仿射变换无法处理非刚性变形（如弯曲叶片和重叠）。

Method: 模型结合了TPS（用于非刚性空间变换）和CBAM（用于抑制背景噪声并增强关键特征），改进了STN-YOLO。

Result: 在PGP数据集上，模型在精度、召回率和mAP上优于STN-YOLO，假阳性减少12%。

Conclusion: 该轻量级模型提升了空间感知能力，适合实时边缘部署，适用于精准农业的智能监测。

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,
disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle
with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection
accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance
through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid
deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align
features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

Motivation: 现有的对比学习方法在多目标图像上表现不佳，需要改进无监督表征。

Method: 通过拼接单目标图像生成多目标图像，利用预定的对象对应关系优化表征。

Result: 在ImageNet、CIFAR和COCO数据集上，MOS方法在单目标和多目标图像上均取得领先的无监督表征性能。

Conclusion: MOS方法简单有效，能显著提升多目标图像的无监督表征能力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中标注数据不足和边界细节捕捉不精确的问题。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，95HD和ASD指标提升至少6%。

Conclusion: C3S3模型显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的精度和边界细节表现。

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical
field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising
solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target
areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle
details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic
inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised
segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition
and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary
delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an
$\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining
boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic
Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing
sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation
quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly
accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to
previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our
approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the
significant advancements. The code is available at

Abstract: The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression,
reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability
for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video
Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could
characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream
compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models
to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at
the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable
high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far
surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of
GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,
systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and
industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of
existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization
strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we
construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective
Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the
most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the
GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a
low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future
practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of
GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and
future opportunities.

TL;DR: ARGUS是一个针对VideoLLM的基准测试，通过自由文本生成任务（如视频字幕）评估模型性能，量化幻觉率和遗漏率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于VideoLLM在自由文本生成任务中幻觉问题严重，现有基准测试（如多选题）无法全面评估其性能。

Method: 提出ARGUS基准，通过比较模型生成的字幕与人工标注的真实字幕，量化幻觉（错误描述）和遗漏（重要细节缺失）率。

Result: ARGUS提供了对视频字幕性能的双重评估指标，弥补了现有基准的不足。

Conclusion: ARGUS为VideoLLM的性能评估提供了更全面的视角，有助于改进模型在自由文本生成任务中的表现。

Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to
their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on
multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more
aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they
do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose
ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning
performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions,
ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in
the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships.
Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive
details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video
captioning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在车辆类别，缺乏对多类别对象的有效解决方案，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计了全局空间注意力融合模块（GSAF）增强多尺度特征学习，引入视觉语义重识别模块（REID）减少ID切换错误，并开发了基于速度的自适应轨迹管理模块（VATM）。

Result: 在V2X-Real和OPV2V数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检测和跟踪精度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多类别道路用户提供了有效的协同感知解决方案，提升了实际场景的适用性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental
understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness
against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection
and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual
frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time.
However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle
superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative
detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in
real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying
appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse
road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion
(GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying
sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that
leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce
ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small
objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet
management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based
on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show
that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in both detection and tracking accuracy.

Motivation: 解决跨域少样本分割中的域差距和数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出DFN作为结构化解耦器，并结合SAM-SVN方法防止过拟合。

Result: 在1-shot和5-shot场景下，性能分别提升2.69%和4.68% MIoU。

Conclusion: DFN能有效解耦域信息，提升跨域少样本分割性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

Result: 在两个视觉数据集和八个主流视觉语言模型上验证了MrM的高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MrM填补了视觉模态成员推理攻击的研究空白，为多模态RAG系统的隐私保护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large
vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their
increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge
databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.
However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access
to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,
particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods
targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the
visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG
systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by
counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to
retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership
information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method
to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.
Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to
prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the
interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we
perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract
features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response
patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial
visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves
consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level
evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

Motivation: 大规模模型在资源受限环境中的广泛部署需要高效传输中间特征表示，而特征压缩过程中的语义退化难以量化，因此需要研究CFQA。

Method: 提出了第一个CFQA基准数据集，包含300个原始特征和12000个压缩特征，评估了MSE、余弦相似度和中心核对齐三种指标的性能。

Result: 数据集具有代表性，但现有指标难以捕捉语义退化的细微差别，需要更精细的指标。

Conclusion: 论文为CFQA研究提供了基础资源，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained
environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of
intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which
compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for
scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this
compression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is
notoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,
this paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality
Assessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed
features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset,
comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from
three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are
provided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics. We
assess the performance of three widely used metrics (MSE, cosine similarity,
and Centered Kernel Alignment) in capturing semantic degradation. The results
underscore the representativeness of the dataset and highlight the need for
more refined metrics capable of addressing the nuances of semantic distortion
in compressed features. To facilitate the ongoing development of CFQA research,
we release the dataset and all accompanying source code at
\href{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}.
This contribution aims to advance the field and provide a foundational resource

Conclusion: DPFormer通过提示方案有效解决了持续学习中的关键问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make
the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task
confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between
different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a
novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt
schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and
tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a
single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters.
Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks
to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified
classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge
distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our
method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and
ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual
learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.

Conclusion: 该模型有效提升了超声图像分割的精度和效率，尤其适用于复杂场景下的胎儿股骨和颅骨分割。

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise
biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces
significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models
are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt
to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly
evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image
segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address
these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent
viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were
designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve
the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized
residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and
enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information
and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different
optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental
validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best
segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has
introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on
construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on
domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and
describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,
despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited
investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks
within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a
comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,
GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify
potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested
under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated
basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided
step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative
analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all
conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced
performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across
models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with
GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also
demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and
consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study
offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs
for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more
reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in motion capture and generative artificial
intelligence, leveraging large-scale MoCap datasets to train generative models
for synthesizing diverse, realistic human motions has become a promising
research direction. However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative
models often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as
interpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in
multi-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To
address these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout
the human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation
within a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions
into a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to
real-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning.
This mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs
post-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of
multi-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework.
Motion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are
introduced to improve model performance. Experiments show our method achieves
impressive results in generated human motion quality, with a 3%-89% improvement
in physical fidelity. Project page http://yw0208.github.io/physiinter

TL;DR: 论文提出GLOS框架，通过时间对齐的gloss级条件改进手语生成，解决了现有方法中词汇顺序错误和语义准确性低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语生成方法因句子级条件无法捕捉时间结构和单词级语义，导致词汇顺序混乱和动作模糊。

Result: 在CSL-Daily和Phoenix-2014T数据集上表现优于现有方法，生成的手语词汇顺序正确且语义准确。

Conclusion: GLOS框架通过时间对齐的gloss级条件显著提升了手语生成的质量。

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

Motivation: GRPO在视频大语言模型中的应用研究较少，且存在依赖安全措施和优势消失问题，需改进。

Method: 提出Reg-GRPO（将GRPO目标重构为回归任务）和难度感知数据增强策略。

Result: DeepVideo-R1在多个视频推理基准测试中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Reg-GRPO和难度感知数据增强策略有效解决了GRPO在视频大语言模型中的学习问题。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement
algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO
to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this
paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that
impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the
vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose
DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO
(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO
reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the
advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping
and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning
the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data
augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable
difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our
comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video
reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种处理文本与视频内容模糊性的框架（ARL），通过多正对比学习和双重三元组损失优化部分相关视频检索（PRVR）。


<details>

Motivation: 传统PRVR训练假设文本与视频一对一相关，忽略了文本与视频内容的模糊性，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 提出ARL框架，基于不确定性和相似性检测模糊对，通过多正对比学习和双重三元组损失学习语义关系，并探索视频内细粒度关系。

Result: ARL框架在PRVR任务中表现出色，有效解决了文本与视频的模糊性问题。

Conclusion: ARL通过检测和学习模糊性，提升了PRVR的性能，为多模态检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a
specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes
of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to
only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and
video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that
incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we
propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous
text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:
uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include
commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates
pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL
hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive
learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained
relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the
text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the
inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often
contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the
text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to
mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to
detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our
proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

Result: 实验表明CoCoA-Mix在专业化和泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoCoA-Mix通过结合CoA-loss和CoA-weights，有效解决了特征对齐和泛化问题。

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and
generalization. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前4D生成技术在现代渲染引擎中效率低且兼容性差，而骨骼动画需要大量手动工作且缺乏跨类别泛化能力。

Method: 使用4D扩散模型对潜在集序列去噪，并通过基于变压器的变分自编码器解码生成网格动画。

Result: 实验表明，DriveAnyMesh能快速生成高质量动画，且兼容现代渲染引擎。

Conclusion: 该方法在游戏和电影行业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose DriveAnyMesh, a method for driving mesh guided by monocular video.
Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering
engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to
rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual
effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets,
instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the
input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion
model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce
mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets
leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing
3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,
transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple
latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated
results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly
produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with
modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both
the gaming and filming industries.

  To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset

ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling
and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art

Abstract: We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view

generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are
directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution

Conclusion: MoQAE通过混合精度量化和优化路由机制，显著提升了KV缓存的效率和效果。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for
long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value
(KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated
promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization
methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this
paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via
mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization
bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts
(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency
caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE
method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a
lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive
loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,
we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to
further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV
cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Result: 42个初步提交和9个决赛方案展示了可行性，创新方法包括跨模态协作和视觉基础模型集成。

Conclusion: APTOS-2024挑战赛首次验证了2D到3D OCT合成的潜力，为资源匮乏地区提供了一种可能的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and
non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical
tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread
adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators.
In comparison, 2D color fundus photography offers faster acquisition and
greater accessibility with less dependence on expensive devices. Although
generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated promising results in
medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images
presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality
and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in
the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society
(APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT
Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework
(referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset,
evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance
(pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level
volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The
challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions
and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data
preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms),
pre-training on external ophthalmic imaging datasets, integration of vision
foundation models, and model architecture improvement. The APTOS-2024 Challenge
is the first benchmark demonstrating the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT
synthesis as a potential solution for improving ophthalmic care accessibility
in under-resourced healthcare settings, while helping to expedite medical
research and clinical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DP图像合成方法难以生成高分辨率且忠实于原始数据的图像，SPTI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPTI将图像转换为文本描述，利用改进的Private Evolution算法生成DP文本，再通过文本到图像模型重建图像。

Result: 在LSUN Bedroom和MM CelebA HQ数据集上，SPTI的FID显著优于现有方法（如26.71 vs 40.36）。

Conclusion: SPTI提供了一种资源高效且兼容专有模型的框架，显著扩展了对私有视觉数据的访问。

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

Motivation: 现有H&E-to-IHC研究常忽视细胞核与细胞膜的跨通道相关性，限制了病理图像分析与诊断的准确性。

Method: CCPL将HER2免疫组化染色分解为Hematoxylin和DAB染色通道，利用Gigapath的Tile Encoder提取双通道特征并测量跨通道相关性，同时计算特征蒸馏损失和光学密度统计。

Result: 实验表明，CCPL在PSNR、SSIM、PCC和FID等指标上表现优异，且病理学家评估确认其能生成高质量虚拟染色图像。

Conclusion: CCPL有效保留病理特征，为多媒体医疗数据的自动化病理诊断提供支持。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital pathology, virtual staining has become
a key technology in multimedia medical information systems, offering new
possibilities for the analysis and diagnosis of pathological images. However,
existing H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations
between cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL
first decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB
staining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,
respectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,
CCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and
measures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features
of the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,
are also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's
feature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.
Additionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density
maps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and
intensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,
SSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,
demonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates
high-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated
pathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation offers significant creative potential yet faces
considerable challenges. The absence of fine-grained multimodal data and the
difficulty of flexible multi-conditional generation limit previous works on
generation controllability and diversity in practice. In this paper, we build
OpenDance5D, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 101 hours across
14 distinct genres. Each sample has five modalities to facilitate robust
cross-modal learning: RGB video, audio, 2D keypoints, 3D motion, and
fine-grained textual descriptions from human arts. Furthermore, we propose
OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance
generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text prompts,
keypoints, or character positioning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the task of writer retrieval, which identifies
documents authored by the same individual within a dataset based on handwriting
similarities. While existing datasets and methodologies primarily focus on page
level retrieval, we explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval
performance by evaluating line- and word level retrieval. We examine three
state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems, including both handcrafted and deep
learning-based approaches, and analyze their performance using varying amounts
of text. Our experiments on the CVL and IAM dataset demonstrate that while
performance decreases by 20-30% when only one line of text is used as query and
gallery, retrieval accuracy remains above 90% of full-page performance when at
least four lines are included. We further show that text-dependent retrieval
can maintain strong performance in low-text scenarios. Our findings also
highlight the limitations of handcrafted features in low-text scenarios, with
deep learning-based methods like NetVLAD outperforming traditional VLAD
encoding.

Conclusion: 3D-SynthPlace和OptiScene为室内布局生成提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to
its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and
embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven
approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and
learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models.
Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high
computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by
coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization
to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout
generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines
synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline,
upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000
scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and
bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations.
We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor
layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our
two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then
conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II,
to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply
multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving
layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based
baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks
such as scene editing and robot navigation.

Motivation: 现有唇读方法提取的视觉特征包含说话人特定属性，导致虚假相关性，影响准确性和泛化能力。

Method: SIFLip采用隐式解耦和显式解耦模块，结合文本嵌入和说话人识别子任务，分离说话人特定特征。

Result: 实验表明，SIFLip在多个公开数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SIFLip通过解耦说话人特征，有效提升了唇读模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态模型被认为比纯语言模型更鲁棒，但其不确定性评估仍存在挑战，包括统一评估方法、提示设计和量化应用。

Method: 提出Uncertainty-o框架，包括模型无关的评估方法、多模态提示扰动实验和多模态语义不确定性量化公式。

Result: 在18个基准测试和10种LMMs上验证了Uncertainty-o的有效性，提升了幻觉检测、缓解和不确定性感知推理等下游任务。

Conclusion: Uncertainty-o为LMMs的不确定性评估提供了统一且有效的解决方案，显著提升了相关下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse
modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models
(LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open
questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的超编码网络（SEN），通过递归关联多模态编码器，提升视频理解任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基础模型仅通过对比学习对齐不同模态的编码器，缺乏深层多模态交互，难以理解复杂视频场景中的目标运动。

Method: 将预训练的编码器视为“超级神经元”，设计递归关联（RA）块，逐步融合多模态信息，通过知识整合、分发和提示实现深层交互。

Result: 在跟踪、识别、聊天和编辑四项视频任务中表现显著提升，例如像素级跟踪的Jaccard指数提高2.7%，文本对齐提升6.4%。

Conclusion: SEN通过递归关联多模态编码器，有效提升了视频理解的性能，为多模态交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world
modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently,
multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale
pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different
modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal
interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with
diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding
Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct
interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the
foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained
encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association
(RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based
on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a
recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper
multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in
downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the
four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition,
chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard
index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular
CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%,
and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video
approach.

Motivation: 扩散模型的高保真图像生成能力带来了安全和隐私风险，如版权侵犯、敏感信息泄露和恶意内容生成。

Method: 攻击者通过扩散模型API生成合成图像，训练替代模型，以最小查询量执行模型提取和对抗攻击。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，方法平均提升27.37%，仅使用0.01倍查询预算，对抗攻击成功率达98.68%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且低成本，突显了扩散模型在安全领域的潜在威胁。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and
photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these
models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the
target model.

Motivation: 当前基于固定长度分块的RAG方法破坏了视频的上下文连续性，无法捕捉真实场景边界，而人类能够自然组织连续经验为连贯场景。

Method: 利用大语言模型处理ASR转录和时间元数据，分割视频为叙事一致的场景，并通过轻量级启发式和迭代修正优化边界。融合视觉和文本模态信息，构建动态知识图谱以支持多跳检索和生成。

Result: 在LongerVideos基准测试中，SceneRAG以72.5%的胜率显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SceneRAG通过自然场景分割和多模态融合，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video
understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains
underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current
RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often
disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture
authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize
continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified
framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into
narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal
metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through
lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework
fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity
relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop
retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments
on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content,
confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a
win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories
(phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis,
action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks.
Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize
across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P
yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain
generalization to unseen procedures and modalities. Our dataset and code are

Conclusion: DragNeXt简化了拖拽编辑流程并提升了质量，代码将开源。

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by
directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention
from the community. However, it faces two key challenges:
(\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and
difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}})
current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision
and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce
high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new
perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of
user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly
specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity
issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region
Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward
Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while
further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure
information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform
existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

Conclusion: 提供选择数据生成策略的实用建议，并分析各方法的优缺点。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled
datasets due to the high cost and complexity of real-world data collection. To
mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and
language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions
and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional
sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a
direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against
classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU
dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor
signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are
evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four
popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves
performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data
conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies
and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Conclusion: 事件视觉先验可显著提升VLM效率，推动边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities.
However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the
VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs
contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the
associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a
novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core
contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic
event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,
EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB
visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions
of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving
tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This
strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while
accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.
Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency
improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline
models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original
Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the
original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the
potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency,
paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable
visual understanding at the edge.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images is one of the most important tasks in
computer graphics. Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate
on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks
fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired
real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the
background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there
might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present
HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D
reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset
uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by
intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore,
the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional
challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a
standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on
this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in
effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the
sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying
data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.

Conclusion: HieraEdgeNet通过系统整合边缘信息，为高精度、高效率的微小目标检测提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

Abstract: Reasoning over visual relationships-spatial, functional, interactional,
social, etc.-is considered to be a fundamental component of human cognition.
Yet, despite the major advances in visual comprehension in multimodal language
models (MLMs), precise reasoning over relationships and their generations
remains a challenge. We introduce ROBIN: an MLM instruction-tuned with densely
annotated relationships capable of constructing high-quality dense scene graphs
at scale. To train ROBIN, we curate SVG, a synthetic scene graph dataset by
completing the missing relations of selected objects in existing scene graphs
using a teacher MLM and a carefully designed filtering process to ensure
high-quality. To generate more accurate and rich scene graphs at scale for any
image, we introduce SG-EDIT: a self-distillation framework where GPT-4o further
refines ROBIN's predicted scene graphs by removing unlikely relations and/or
suggesting relevant ones. In total, our dataset contains 146K images and 5.6M
relationships for 2.6M objects. Results show that our ROBIN-3B model, despite
being trained on less than 3 million instances, outperforms similar-size models
trained on over 300 million instances on relationship understanding benchmarks,
and even surpasses larger models up to 13B parameters. Notably, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension with a score
of 88.9, surpassing the previous best of 87.4. Our results suggest that
training on the refined scene graph data is crucial to maintaining high
performance across diverse visual reasoning task.

TL;DR: FMaMIL是一种基于图像级标签的弱监督病灶分割框架，通过两阶段方法实现高效分割，无需像素级标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组织病理学图像中病灶分割的挑战，尤其是像素级标注成本高的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用Mamba编码器和频域编码模块生成CAMs；第二阶段通过软标签监督和自校正机制优化伪标签。

Result: 在公共和私有数据集上表现优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: FMaMIL在数字病理学中具有潜力，无需依赖像素级标注。

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for
diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging
due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address
this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised
lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a
lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range
dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial
sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain
encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based
information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation
training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a
CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling
robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public
and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level
annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology
applications.

TL;DR: ProSplat是一个两阶段前馈框架，用于在宽基线条件下实现高保真渲染，通过3D高斯基元生成和扩散模型增强视图，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射在宽基线场景下因纹理细节不足和几何不一致导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 生成3D高斯基元；2) 通过扩散模型增强渲染视图，结合MORI和DWEA优化。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV-10K数据集上，PSNR平均提升1 dB。

Conclusion: ProSplat在宽基线条件下显著提升了渲染质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising
results for novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, particularly
under narrow-baseline conditions. However, its performance significantly
degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and
geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for
high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage
involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second
stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement
model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion
model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view
Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI
supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference
view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency
using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer
training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through
joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K
datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that
ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent
SOTA methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
neural scene reconstruction, offering high-quality novel view synthesis while
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we extend the capabilities
of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling,
termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to
associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained
scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with
a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve
accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language
embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven
instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and
segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.
We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++
validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: NOVA3D通过整合3D先验和几何信息，显著提升了多视角一致性和纹理保真度。

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone
to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score
Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion
models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient
multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative
single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging
strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating
geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate
information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the
Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving
generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the
de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by
addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose
alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over
existing baselines.

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上，该方法优于现有盲超分辨率算法。

Conclusion: 动态滤波网络能有效处理多种退化类型，提升图像重建质量。

Abstract: Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct
degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network
model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that
prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can
be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as
spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in
image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class
degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the
image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant
degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and
local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly
alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic
filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in
different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to
multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's
representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts
feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator,
which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features
to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating
both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both
synthetic and real image datasets.

Method: FlowV2V将视频编辑任务分解为第一帧编辑和条件I2V生成，通过模拟伪光流序列确保编辑过程中的时间一致性。

Conclusion: FlowV2V通过光流驱动的I2V生成方法，为复杂运动视频编辑提供了高效解决方案，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

Result: 在多种网络架构和数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReverB-SNN在保持SNN优势的同时显著提升了精度。

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a biologically inspired neural network
infrastructure, has garnered significant attention recently. SNNs utilize
binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing
multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However,
binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information,
resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing
the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN},
inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from
quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs
real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves
the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while
enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a
trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight
amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain
efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight
SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique
during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures
and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 采用异步系统ETA，将大模型的计算任务提前到前一帧，结合小模型实时提取当前帧特征，并通过动作掩码机制整合双特征。

Result: 在Bench2Drive CARLA Leaderboard-v2基准测试中，ETA将驾驶分数提升8%，达到69.53，同时保持50ms的近实时推理速度。

Conclusion: ETA系统成功实现了大模型的高效利用，同时保证了实时性，为自动驾驶系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a
common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system
architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a
larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system
designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either
directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved
from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle
to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key
insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous
time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large
models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we
introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system
designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current
frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame
features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate
these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes
action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA
Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with
a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at
50 ms.

Method: 提出CSGC机制增强特征表示，设计轻量级残差块减少计算量。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上性能显著提升，能耗降低72.2%，检测性能仅下降4%。

Conclusion: SpikeSMOKE在低功耗3D目标检测中表现出色，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area
because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in
fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with
low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this
research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose
the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power
monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will
generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared
with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,
inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose
a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature
representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated
filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the
speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can
maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection
performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection,
the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2,
Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by
AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the
results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to
the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by
72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only
4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3
times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

Method: 通过合成数据集和预训练奖励模型实现闭环反馈，优化资产提取。

Conclusion: AssetDropper为设计师提供了高效的开放世界资产提取工具，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Recent research on generative models has primarily focused on creating
product-ready visual outputs; however, designers often favor access to
standardized asset libraries, a domain that has yet to be significantly
enhanced by generative capabilities. Although open-world scenes provide ample
raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized
assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the
first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing
artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front
view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex
scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a
synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world
benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of
future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset
extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained
reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model
to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the
reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and
mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of
reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results
in asset extraction. Project page: AssetDropper.github.io.

Method: 构建ArchDiffBench数据集（1,765张高质量建筑图像），开发ArchiLense框架，结合计算机视觉和深度学习技术实现自动识别与分类。

Result: ArchiLense在风格识别中表现优异，与专家标注一致性达92.4%，分类准确率为84.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为建筑文化比较研究提供了更客观、准确的视角，超越了传统主观分析。

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic
diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition
to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the
ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects
from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery.
However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on
subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often
suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these
challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a
professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises
1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style
annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We
propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models
and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced
computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms,
ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise
classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language
outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show
that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition,
with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification
accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The
proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses
and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of
architectural culture.

Conclusion: Flow-Anything 首次证明了从大规模真实图像生成光学流数据的有效性，为视频任务提供了基础模型。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, serving as
a foundation for video tasks. However, the real-world robustness is limited by
animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when
applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a
large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation
from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to
make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D
representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows
us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second,
we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware
Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These
two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale
single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we
demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from
large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised
methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models
serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream
video tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常局限于特定模型（如InstructPix2Pix），可能引入偏见或编辑能力受限，因此需要一种更通用的方法。

Method: 通过Delta插值提取差异，结合Token一致性损失和零初始化Token嵌入，构建适用于稳定扩散模型的完整提示。

Result: 实验表明，Difference Inversion在定量和定性上均优于现有基线，能够以模型无关的方式生成更可行的B'。

Conclusion: Difference Inversion是一种高效且通用的方法，能够克服模型依赖性，提升图像编辑能力。

Abstract: How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B', given the input
images A,A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches
like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However, these methods
are typically limited to specific models (e.g. InstructPix2Pix. Inpainting
models) rather than general diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL).
This dependency may lead to inherited biases or lower editing capabilities. In
this paper, we propose Difference Inversion, a method that isolates only the
difference from A and A' and applies it to B to generate a plausible B'. To
address model dependency, it is crucial to structure prompts in the form of a
"Full Prompt" suitable for input to stable diffusion models, rather than using
an "Instruction Prompt". To this end, we accurately extract the Difference
between A and A' and combine it with the prompt of B, enabling a plug-and-play
application of the difference. To extract a precise difference, we first
identify it through 1) Delta Interpolation. Additionally, to ensure accurate
training, we propose the 2) Token Consistency Loss and 3) Zero Initialization
of Token Embeddings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Difference
Inversion outperforms existing baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively,
indicating its ability to generate more feasible B' in a model-agnostic manner.

Abstract: We introduce a trend-aware and visually-grounded fashion recommendation
system that integrates deep visual representations, garment-aware segmentation,
semantic category similarity and user behavior simulation. Our pipeline
extracts focused visual embeddings by masking non-garment regions via semantic
segmentation followed by feature extraction using pretrained CNN backbones
(ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we
generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness
and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring
function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity
alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender
alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95%
category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has
fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities.
However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from
generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual
reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a
step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and
execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with
execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the
task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to
generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning
task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the
composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence
reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we
improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving
logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM
hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and
correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to
launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve
the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with
four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent
achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual
reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM
based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the
novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer,
Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高质量的双光谱数据集和全面的评估框架，用于可见光和红外图像融合，并验证了融合模型在下游任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可见光和红外图像融合方法缺乏标准化评估和高质量数据集，限制了其在实际任务中的应用。

Method: 构建了一个包含1,369对对齐图像的数据集，并提出一个结合融合速度、通用指标和目标检测性能的评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，针对下游任务优化的融合模型在目标检测中表现更优，尤其是在低光和遮挡场景中。

Conclusion: 论文贡献包括高质量数据集、任务感知的评估框架以及对现有融合方法的全面分析，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Visible images offer rich texture details, while infrared images emphasize
salient targets. Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene
understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging
conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention,
but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without
standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack
of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders
progress.
  To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset
captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared
image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke
occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation
framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection
performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in
downstream evaluation.
  Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms
under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for
downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially
in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on
general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting
limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our
proposed framework.
  The main contributions of this work are: (1)a campus-oriented dual-spectrum
dataset with diverse and challenging scenes; (2) a task-aware, comprehensive
evaluation framework; and (3) thorough comparative analysis of leading fusion
methods across multiple datasets, offering insights for future development.

Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在VQA任务中面临知识库中推理示例稀缺和检索知识响应不一致的挑战。

Method: 提出RCTS框架，包括构建推理上下文丰富的知识库和基于蒙特卡洛树搜索与启发式奖励（MCTS-HR）的重排序方法。

Result: 实验表明，RCTS在多个VQA数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著优于ICL和Vanilla-RAG方法。

Conclusion: RCTS框架通过高质量的知识库和重排序方法，显著提升了LVLMs的性能和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉编码器在应用中表现出色，但其内部特征表示机制尚不明确，因此需要一种方法来解释这些特征。

Method: 通过图像重建比较不同视觉编码器（如SigLIP和SigLIP2），分析其特征表示的信息量，并探索特征空间的操作对重建图像的影响。

Result: 基于图像任务预训练的编码器保留更多图像信息；特征空间的正交旋转控制颜色编码。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任何视觉编码器，揭示了特征空间的内部结构，为理解视觉编码器提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from
vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models.
Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures
represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for
interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related
model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training
objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain
significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such
as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision
encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations.
Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable
changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather
than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be
applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its
feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are
available in GitHub.

Conclusion: UGTSR框架有效提升了超分辨率任务中的纹理细节重建和特征匹配精度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in codebook-based real image super-resolution (SR) have
shown promising results in real-world applications. The core idea involves
matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution
(LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges:
inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail
reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided
and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key
components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to
focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that
enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and
(3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information
between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to
existing methods. We will release the code upon formal publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答任务依赖显式视觉证据，但在处理隐含问题时性能下降，因此需要新方法。

Method: 提出IRM框架，包含AIM和VEM模块，通过双流建模和上下文增强解决隐含问题。

Result: IRM在I-VQA任务中性能优于GPT-4o等模型，提升幅度为0.76%至4.87%。

Conclusion: IRM有效解决了隐含视觉证据的视频问答问题，并在相关任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions
based on the given video, with prior work primarily focusing on identifying the
duration of relevant segments, referred to as explicit visual evidence.
However, explicit visual evidence is not always directly available,
particularly when questions target symbolic meanings or deeper intentions,
leading to significant performance degradation. To fill this gap, we introduce
a novel task and dataset, $\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{V}$ideo
$\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (I-VQA), which focuses on answering
questions in scenarios where explicit visual evidence is inaccessible. Given an
implicit question and its corresponding video, I-VQA requires answering based
on the contextual visual cues present within the video. To tackle I-VQA, we
propose a novel reasoning framework, IRM (Implicit Reasoning Model),
incorporating dual-stream modeling of contextual actions and intent clues as
implicit reasoning chains. IRM comprises the Action-Intent Module (AIM) and the
Visual Enhancement Module (VEM). AIM deduces and preserves question-related
dual clues by generating clue candidates and performing relation deduction. VEM
enhances contextual visual representation by leveraging key contextual clues.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our IRM in I-VQA tasks,
outperforming GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and fine-tuned VideoChat2 by $0.76\%$,
$1.37\%$, and $4.87\%$, respectively. Additionally, IRM performs SOTA on
similar implicit advertisement understanding and future prediction in
traffic-VQA. Datasets and codes are available for double-blind review in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定尺度超分辨率缺乏灵活性，而现有方法在连续尺度分布上学习困难。

Method: 采用自级联扩散框架，将大尺度分解为小尺度逐步处理，结合坐标引导残差扩散模型。

Result: CasArbi在多种任意尺度超分辨率基准测试中，感知和失真性能均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CasArbi通过渐进式上采样和扩散模型，实现了高效且灵活的任意尺度超分辨率。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired
resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale
super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or
generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process,
which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of
scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in
mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible
upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel
self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.
CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller
sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each
step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel
coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of
continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in
both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse
arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2Restore提出了一种基于Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）和Mamba-CNN融合的框架，用于高效、鲁棒的全能图像恢复，解决了现有方法在动态退化场景中泛化能力不足和局部细节与全局依赖平衡不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然图像常受复合退化（如雨、雪、雾）影响，现有方法在动态退化场景中泛化能力有限，且难以平衡局部细节与全局依赖。

Method: 1. 使用CLIP引导的MoE门控机制融合任务条件提示与CLIP语义先验；2. 设计双流架构结合CNN的局部表征与Mamba的长程建模；3. 引入边缘感知动态门控机制自适应平衡全局与局部。

Result: 在多个图像恢复基准测试中，M2Restore在视觉质量和定量性能上均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: M2Restore通过创新的架构和机制，显著提升了图像恢复的泛化能力和细节保留效果。

Abstract: Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as
rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications.
While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they
are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across
dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between
preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these
challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image
restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the
model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a
CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with
CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal
feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various
degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies
and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that
integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range
modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative
optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,
preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we
introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances
global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention
to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient
and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image
restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual
quality and quantitative performance.

Result: 发现模型在数据流形附近行为不同，训练集规模和目标函数影响去噪轨迹和分数准确性。

Conclusion: 为理解扩散模型如何学习数据分布提供了新视角，对实际应用中的模型可靠性有启示。

Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes:
memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and
generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been
tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective
denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this
gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under
low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and
interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii)
analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint
data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs
converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective
choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing
insights into how these models actually learn representations of data
distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of
generative model reliability in practical applications where small
perturbations are common.

Motivation: 超高清遥感图像的语义分割在环境监测和城市规划中至关重要，但传统方法存在细节丢失或全局上下文碎片化的问题，多分支网络则存在计算效率低和梯度冲突的挑战。

Method: F2Net将图像分解为高频和低频组件，高频分支保留全分辨率细节，低频分支通过双子分支捕获短程和长程依赖关系，并通过混合频率融合模块整合结果。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和Inria Aerial基准测试中，F2Net分别达到80.22和83.39的mIoU，表现最优。

Conclusion: F2Net通过频率分解和融合模块，实现了高效且稳定的超高清遥感图像语义分割。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery
is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning
but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods
either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via
patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they
suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during
training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR
images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The
high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the
low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module
integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency
Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and
Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to
stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,
respectively. Our code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: PolyVivid通过多模块协同实现了高质量的多主体视频生成，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack
fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with
consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a
multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and
identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between
subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion
module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise
grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we
propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured
bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an
attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused
identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.
Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based
grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to
produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject
distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in
identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因标注数据集稀缺而发展受限的问题。

Method: 结合SMART-OD（自动掩码生成与开放世界目标检测）和FLASH（实时视频实例分割），通过统计方法减少错误并保持对象跟踪一致性。

Result: 实验证明其精度接近人工标注，且能处理多样化数据集而无需重新训练或参数调整。

Conclusion: SAM2Auto为自动视频标注设定了新基准，加速了VLM的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the
scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations
is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets
requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach
consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that
combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection
capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a
multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains
consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent
detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require
frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives,
our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while
ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves
comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation
time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse
datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments,
making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work
establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a
pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset
bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

Motivation: 解决传统相机在高速度乒乓球运动中存在的延迟和运动模糊问题。

Method: 结合事件相机、眼动数据和生物启发式视觉处理，优化资源分配。

Result: 系统总延迟仅为4.5毫秒，比传统30 FPS系统快14.6倍。

Conclusion: 首次实现基于事件相机的第一视角乒乓球轨迹预测，性能显著提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system
for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer
from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide
higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater
robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short
time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game
sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized
with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our
system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to
process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach
improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational
latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually
relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected
trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms,
including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based
30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.
Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the
ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from
an egocentric perspective using event cameras.

Conclusion: VIVAT为优化VAE训练提供了实用解决方案，同时保持了KL-VAE的简洁性。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

Result: 模型在DSEC基准测试中表现优异，推理速度比TMA快4.5倍，计算量比EV-FlowNet低2倍。

Conclusion: STSSM为事件相机的运动估计提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with
standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion
estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications.
In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount.
Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown
remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency.
Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are
computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient
spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better
performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce
Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network
architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive
performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively
capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance
with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar
settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations
compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with
competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at

Abstract: With the increasing availability of aerial and satellite imagery, deep
learning presents significant potential for transportation asset management,
safety analysis, and urban planning. This study introduces CrosswalkNet, a
robust and efficient deep learning framework designed to detect various types
of pedestrian crosswalks from 15-cm resolution aerial images. CrosswalkNet
incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object
detection strategies by utilizing oriented bounding boxes (OBB), enhancing
detection precision by accurately capturing crosswalks regardless of their
orientation. Several optimization techniques, including Convolutional Block
Attention, a dual-branch Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast module, and cosine
annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A
comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is
utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing
model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial
imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.
CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire,
Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its
robustness and strong generalization capability. Additionally, the crosswalk
detection results, processed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms
and provided in polygon shapefile format, have been shown to accelerate data
processing and detection, supporting real-time analysis for safety and mobility
applications. This integration offers policymakers, transportation engineers,
and urban planners an effective instrument to enhance pedestrian safety and
improve urban mobility.

Conclusion: EgoM2P为自中心4D理解提供通用解决方案，开源以推动研究。

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video,
depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented
reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction. These capabilities enable
systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and
surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal
and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently
heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and
settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or
head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard
supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera
motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video
pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal
foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal
tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from
temporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for
egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across
diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,
egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric
video. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric
video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist
models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source
EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project

Motivation: 视频生成模型可能继承训练数据中的偏见和有害内容，导致用户生成不良或非法内容，亟需解决方案。

Method: 使用5对多模态提示（安全与不安全示例），计算其潜在差异生成“拒绝向量”，并通过低秩分解方法优化，直接嵌入模型权重。

Result: 方法有效中和多种有害内容（如裸露、暴力、版权问题等），同时保持视频生成质量，无需重新训练或原始数据。

Conclusion: 该技术为视频生成模型提供了一种高效、鲁棒的无学习方案，显著降低了有害内容生成的风险。

Abstract: Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through
intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful
concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance
creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even
illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored
explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our
method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe"
and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their
per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once
subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We
introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference
of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target
concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus
preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the
model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the
original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the
model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust
against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output
filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we
can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity,
graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks. Project page:

Abstract: Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1,
extending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While
recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning
(RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on
domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question
remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning
through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel
Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates
context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the
given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K
multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse
dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive
exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that
combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL
training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM
benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances
performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.
Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase
data diversity to further improve model performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging
landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its
capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise
classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for
remote sensing change detection tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多模态上下文学习（MM-ICL）中依赖浅层启发式方法，而非真正任务理解。通过分布偏移评估，发现性能随演示增加而下降，模型倾向于复制答案。提出的新方法加入推理步骤，但实验表明当前VLMs未有效利用演示信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否真正具备多模态上下文学习能力，而非依赖浅层启发式方法。

Method: 提出MM-ICL with Reasoning管道，为每个演示生成答案和推理依据，并在不同数据集和模型上进行实验。

Result: 性能对演示数量、检索方法等不敏感，表明当前VLMs未有效利用演示信息。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在多模态上下文学习中表现有限，需进一步改进以提升任务理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

Motivation: 现有方法在图像标记化过程中破坏了对象的空间关系，限制了多模态推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先生成保留空间关系的DT表示，然后利用LLM进行推理。

Result: 在两个图像RS基准和三个图像参考分割基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DT表示是视觉与文本之间的有效桥梁，仅需LLM即可完成复杂多模态推理任务。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires
segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise
visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches
rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and
reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous
spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS
approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate
layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger
reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image
into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and
semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform
explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We
propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT
representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to
enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments
show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS
benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT
representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text,
enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an
LLM.

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of
internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church
moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes,
document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source
for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six
million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten
migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that
included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting
recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a
structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family
migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study
from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be
reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival
material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and
demographic research.

Motivation: 现有基准难以全面评估MLLMs从原子到组合层面的空间智能，因此需要SpaCE-10填补这一空白。

Method: 提出分层标注流程生成高质量QA对，并通过150+小时专家努力收集数据，覆盖点云输入和多选QA等场景。

Result: 先进MLLMs在SpaCE-10上表现仍远逊于人类，且计数能力不足限制了其组合空间能力。

Conclusion: SpaCE-10为MLLM社区提供了重要发现和评估工具，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require
integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic
tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the
spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional
level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for
compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial
capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on
these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to
generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+
hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor
scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud
input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs
on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans
by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant
findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the
shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial
capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are

Result: 实验显示CyberV显著提升模型性能，如Qwen2.5-VL-7B提升8.3%，InternVL3-8B提升5.5%，甚至接近人类专家水平。

Conclusion: CyberV有效提升MLLMs在动态视频理解中的鲁棒性和准确性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with
understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time,
lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their
feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for
models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as
adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic
resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a
cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a
Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and
collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the
controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate
feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework
enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.
Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B
by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive
proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%
improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.
Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose
benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for
dynamic video understanding. The code is released at

Result: OneIG-Bench提供了细粒度的模型性能分析，帮助研究者识别图像生成流程中的优势和瓶颈。

Conclusion: OneIG-Bench通过公开代码和数据集，促进了T2I研究社区的可重复评测和跨模型比较。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating
high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model
advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive
evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and
style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge
modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems
requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not
adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we
introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark
framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,
including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated
content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this
benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers
and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of
image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by
allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of
generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only
for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the
corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly
available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model
comparisons within the T2I research community.

demonstrates performance comparable to multi-camera systems, without the need
for specialized or costly infrastructure. This work provides a practical method
for accessible and accurate 3D ball tracking in professional football

Conclusion: CXR-LT 2024为开发临床现实和泛化性强的胸部X光诊断模型提供了重要资源，推动了相关研究的进展。

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung
disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open
long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of
state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve
these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development
and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting
lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT
2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45
disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a
new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the
previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for
chest radiography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经元解释方法的可靠性评估通常依赖众包，但存在噪音大、成本高的问题，需要更高效的评估策略。

Method: 引入重要性采样选择最有价值的输入展示给评估者，并提出贝叶斯方法聚合多个评分，显著降低成本和噪音。

Result: 实现了约30倍的成本降低和约5倍的评分数量减少，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模比较神经元解释质量提供了高效工具，并验证了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TACA的方法，通过动态调整跨模态注意力机制，解决了MM-DiT模型中文本与图像对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MM-DiT模型（如FLUX）在文本驱动视觉生成中，存在跨模态注意力不平衡和缺乏时间步感知的问题，导致文本与生成内容对齐不精确。

Method: 提出TACA方法，通过温度缩放和时间步依赖调整动态平衡多模态交互，并结合LoRA微调。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench基准测试中，TACA显著提升了文本-图像对齐效果，并在FLUX和SD3.5等模型中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 平衡跨模态注意力对提升文本到图像扩散模型的语义保真度至关重要，TACA是一种高效且计算开销低的方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress
in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models
like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and
generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of
MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token
imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of
timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address
these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention
(TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal
interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment.
When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image
alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead.
We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating
its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance,
attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the
importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in
text-to-image diffusion models. Our codes are publicly available at

TL;DR: PairEdit是一种无需文本指导的视觉编辑方法，通过少量图像对学习复杂编辑语义，显著提升内容一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于示例的编辑方法仍需依赖文本描述或隐式文本指令，而某些编辑语义难以用文本精确描述。

Method: 提出目标噪声预测和内容保持噪声调度，通过优化LoRAs解耦语义变化与内容学习。

Result: PairEdit成功学习复杂语义，内容一致性显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PairEdit为无需文本指导的图像编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable
success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic
control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify
precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves
learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing
exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change
within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In
this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to
effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image
pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We
propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations
within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce
a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic
learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning
of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics
while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: MADFormer是一种混合自回归（AR）和扩散模型的Transformer，通过空间块划分和垂直混合层优化高分辨率图像生成，显著提升性能和质量效率平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合模型缺乏系统指导如何分配AR和扩散模型的能力，需要探索更有效的结合方式。

Method: MADFormer将图像生成分为空间块，AR层用于全局条件，扩散层用于局部细化，通过实验分析AR与扩散的权衡。

Result: 实验表明，块划分显著提升高分辨率图像性能，垂直混合AR和扩散层在有限计算下FID提升75%。

Conclusion: MADFormer为未来混合生成模型提供了实用的设计原则。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

Conclusion: 该框架在3D场景理解和任务处理中表现出色，为未来研究提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in
assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating
and interacting within a three-dimensional space. Inspired by advances in
language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive
models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a
unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a
detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal
training and performance addressing key questions related to data
representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance
across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and
question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend
our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D
modality with quantized shape encodings, and show our model's effectiveness on

TL;DR: MTV是一个用于音频同步视频生成的框架，通过分离音频轨道实现精细控制，并引入DEMIX数据集支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频与视频的紧密同步在可控视频生成中至关重要，但现有方法在高质量和精确同步方面表现不足。

Method: MTV框架将音频分为语音、效果和音乐轨道，分别控制唇部动作、事件时间和视觉氛围，并利用DEMIX数据集进行多阶段训练。

Result: MTV在视频质量、文本-视频一致性和音频-视频对齐等六个标准指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MTV通过分离音频轨道和多阶段训练，实现了高质量且精确同步的视频生成。

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world,
making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable
video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio
into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives
(e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall
short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual
synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this
work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation.
MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks,
enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood,
respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video
generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset
comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is
structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training
for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV
achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning
video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练的情况下实现了高质量的动态视图合成。

Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an
inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise
initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable
high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary
modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic
inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and
resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order
Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this
representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the
VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions
resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which
performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded
regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can
be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise
initialization phase.

Abstract: We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves
zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming
limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera
calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we
design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling
noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a
language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust
feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we
develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts
to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to
generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous
driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on
three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly
introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto
(GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens
the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world

Conclusion: Dreamland在可控性和生成质量上显著优于基线方法，具有增强AI代理训练的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic
visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise
controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI
agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the
granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content
output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a
layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level
semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the
simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability,
minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world
distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained
generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the
training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate
that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image
quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance
embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

Motivation: 探索VLMs如何整合视觉与语言信息，并评估其在视觉任务中的表现。

Method: 通过一系列视觉基准测试（如深度估计、对应关系）比较VLMs与视觉编码器的性能，并分析其失败原因。

Result: VLMs在视觉任务中表现接近随机水平，主要瓶颈在于未能有效利用视觉信息，且受语言先验影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了开源VLMs的失败模式，为未来改进视觉理解提供了评估方法。

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

Result: 实现了单GPU上的实时视频生成，延迟低于一秒，生成质量与更慢的非因果扩散模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: Self Forcing通过自生成输出和高效训练策略，显著提升了视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

Conclusion: 测试时注册令牌为预训练模型提供了一种无需训练的解决方案，提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

Conclusion: 规则简单的游戏可作为可控、可扩展的预训练任务，解锁MLLM的通用多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning
abilities in MLLMs.

Conclusion: StableMTL通过创新的任务注意力机制和潜在损失设计，实现了高效的多任务学习。

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive
annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with
partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models,
we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a
multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset
of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent
regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task
sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components,
enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object

rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike
optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference,
reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to
long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video
datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in
real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods
on cross-domain videos. Project page: https://4dgt.github.io

Motivation: 解决高分辨率图像生成中归一化流模型的扩展性和性能问题。

Method: 提出TARFlow结合归一化流和Transformer，采用深度-浅层设计、潜在空间建模和新型引导算法。

Result: 在类条件和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，接近扩散模型的样本质量。

Conclusion: STARFlow首次证明了归一化流在大规模高分辨率图像生成中的有效性。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos
presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been
dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area.
Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a
differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However,
these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for
each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their
practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework,
Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and
physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear
Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile
representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the
observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward
neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight
optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and
physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few
minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality,
mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing
geometry and physical properties from video data.

Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3DGS）在训练视角不足时，对未见过或被遮挡部分的渲染质量较低。环境中的重复元素为解决这一问题提供了机会。

Method: 提出一种方法，通过分割3DGS重建中的重复实例、对齐它们并共享信息，同时考虑实例间的外观变化。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中验证，新视角合成质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用重复元素能有效改善场景重建和新视角合成的质量。

Abstract: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly
improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts
remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key
observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We
propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of
low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose
a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction,
registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances.
Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance
variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of
synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a
substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

Motivation: 现有微调方法在主体驱动图像合成中存在欠拟合（无法可靠捕捉主体身份）和过拟合（记忆主体图像并减少背景多样性）问题。

Method: 提出两种辅助一致性损失：1）先验一致性正则化损失，确保非主体图像的扩散噪声与预训练模型一致；2）主体一致性正则化损失，增强模型对噪声调制潜码的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，加入这些损失后，模型在CLIP分数、背景多样性和视觉质量上优于DreamBooth。

Conclusion: 通过一致性损失，模型在保持主体身份的同时提升了图像多样性，解决了微调中的关键问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP
scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

Conclusion: 该方法成功平衡了收敛性和并行性，适用于刚性和软材料的高质量模拟。

Abstract: In parallel simulation, convergence and parallelism are often seen as
inherently conflicting objectives. Improved parallelism typically entails
lighter local computation and weaker coupling, which unavoidably slow the
global convergence. This paper presents a novel GPU algorithm that achieves
convergence rates comparable to fullspace Newton's method while maintaining
good parallelizability just like the Jacobi method. Our approach is built on a
key insight into the phenomenon of overshoot. Overshoot occurs when a local
solver aggressively minimizes its local energy without accounting for the
global context, resulting in a local update that undermines global convergence.
To address this, we derive a theoretically second-order optimal solution to
mitigate overshoot. Furthermore, we adapt this solution into a pre-computable
form. Leveraging Cubature sampling, our runtime cost is only marginally higher
than the Jacobi method, yet our algorithm converges nearly quadratically as
Newton's method. We also introduce a novel full-coordinate formulation for more
efficient pre-computation. Our method integrates seamlessly with the
incremental potential contact method and achieves second-order convergence for
both stiff and soft materials. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach delivers high-quality simulations and outperforms state-of-the-art GPU
methods with 50 to 100 times better convergence.

Abstract: Cross fields play a critical role in various geometry processing tasks,
especially for quad mesh generation. Existing methods for cross field
generation often struggle to balance computational efficiency with generation
quality, using slow per-shape optimization. We introduce CrossGen, a novel
framework that supports both feed-forward prediction and latent generative
modeling of cross fields for quad meshing by unifying geometry and cross field
representations within a joint latent space. Our method enables extremely fast
computation of high-quality cross fields of general input shapes, typically
within one second without per-shape optimization. Our method assumes a
point-sampled surface, or called a point-cloud surface, as input, so we can
accommodate various different surface representations by a straightforward
point sampling process. Using an auto-encoder network architecture, we encode
input point-cloud surfaces into a sparse voxel grid with fine-grained latent
spaces, which are decoded into both SDF-based surface geometry and cross
fields. We also contribute a dataset of models with both high-quality signed
distance fields (SDFs) representations and their corresponding cross fields,
and use it to train our network. Once trained, the network is capable of
computing a cross field of an input surface in a feed-forward manner, ensuring
high geometric fidelity, noise resilience, and rapid inference. Furthermore,
leveraging the same unified latent representation, we incorporate a diffusion
model for computing cross fields of new shapes generated from partial input,
such as sketches. To demonstrate its practical applications, we validate
CrossGen on the quad mesh generation task for a large variety of surface
shapes. Experimental results...

Conclusion: 该设计为资源受限设备上的3DGS实时渲染提供了高效解决方案，并计划开源以推动领域发展。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

Result: 实验表明，该方法灵活，能生成复杂多对象或多人的交互序列，显著提升零样本4D HOI生成的逼真度和文本对齐性。

Conclusion: HOI-PAGE通过细粒度部分推理，实现了更真实和多样化的4D HOI合成。

Abstract: We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object
interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by
part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on
global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that
generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding --
at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus
introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation
distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part
information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a
three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric
parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we
extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion
sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy
part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is
flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person
interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment
for zero-shot 4D HOI generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both
static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian
primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D
segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe
rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG:
Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach
that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects
in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping
from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation.
Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented
objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we
have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients,
specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian
primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual
consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also
opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic

Conclusion: 为分辨率无关的3D场景增强建立了新范式。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D
scene enhancement.

Abstract: Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve
high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the
time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian
neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting
rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,
we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general
pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS
representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary
techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that
identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene
reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that
improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.
Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters
Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation
per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our
techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by
$7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.
SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on
the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be
integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.

Conclusion: Squeeze3D无需特定对象训练即可实现高效压缩和解压缩，支持多种3D数据格式。

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

Motivation: 研究DCIC问题的动机在于解决代理可能策略性误报效用的现实场景，同时扩展PNOI问题的应用范围。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较纯委托机制与PNOI策略，并设计近似机制以优化委托与检查成本。

Result: 在无成本委托下，证明了3-近似解是紧的，并在相同检查成本下改进为2-近似。

Conclusion: DCIC问题在理论和实践中具有重要意义，提出的近似机制为复杂场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of delegated choice with inspection cost (DCIC), which
is a variant of the delegated choice problem by Kleinberg and Kleinberg (EC'18)
as well as an extension of the Pandora's box problem with nonobligatory
inspection (PNOI) by Doval (JET'18). In our model, an agent may strategically
misreport the proposed element's utility, unlike the standard delegated choice
problem which assumes that the agent truthfully reports the utility for the
proposed alternative. Thus, the principal needs to inspect the proposed element
possibly along with other alternatives to maximize its own utility, given an
exogenous cost of inspecting each element. Further, the delegation itself
incurs a fixed cost, thus the principal can decide whether to delegate or not
and inspect by herself.
  We show that DCIC indeed is a generalization of PNOI where the side
information from a strategic agent is available at certain cost, implying its
NP-hardness by Fu, Li, and Liu (STOC'23). We first consider a costless
delegation setting in which the cost of delegation is free. We prove that the
maximal mechanism over the pure delegation with a single inspection and an PNOI
policy without delegation achieves a $3$-approximation for DCIC with costless
delegation, which is further proven to be tight. These results hold even when
the cost comes from an arbitrary monotone set function, and can be improved to
a $2$-approximation if the cost of inspection is the same for every element. We
extend these techniques by presenting a constant factor approximate mechanism

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在无限时间多玩家随机游戏中计算最优相关均衡（CEs）的问题，提出了一种基于可诱导值集的算法，能够在多项式时间内计算(ε, δ)-最优CE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于历史依赖策略在无限时间随机游戏中难以表示和计算，论文旨在解决这一挑战，并提出高效的近似算法。

Method: 提出了一种基于可诱导值集的算法，通过迭代更新值集估计来克服历史依赖策略的表示问题。

Result: 算法在多项式时间内计算(ε, δ)-最优CE，并在回合制游戏中进一步降低复杂度。论文还证明了双准则近似的必要性。

Conclusion: 该算法为多玩家随机游戏中的最优CE计算提供了基础，并通过可诱导值集的方法解决了历史依赖策略的表示难题。

Abstract: We study the problem of computing optimal correlated equilibria (CEs) in
infinite-horizon multi-player stochastic games, where correlation signals are
provided over time. In this setting, optimal CEs require history-dependent
policies; this poses new representational and algorithmic challenges as the
number of possible histories grows exponentially with the number of time steps.
We focus on computing $(\epsilon, \delta)$-optimal CEs -- solutions that
achieve a value within $\epsilon$ of an optimal CE, while allowing the agents'
incentive constraints to be violated by at most $\delta$. Our main result is an
algorithm that computes an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-optimal CE in time polynomial in
$1/(\epsilon\delta(1 - \gamma))^{n+1}$, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor,
and $n$ is the number of agents. For (a slightly more general variant of)
turn-based games, we further reduce the complexity to a polynomial in $n$. We
also establish that the bi-criterion approximation is necessary by proving
matching inapproximability bounds.
  Our technical core is a novel approach based on inducible value sets, which
leverages a compact representation of history-dependent CEs through the values
they induce to overcome the representational challenge. We develop the
value-set iteration algorithm -- which operates by iteratively updating
estimates of inducible value sets -- and characterize CEs as the greatest fixed
point of the update map. Our algorithm provides a groundwork for computing
optimal CEs in general multi-player stochastic settings.

Result: 揭示了广告可能利用用户信任实现其他目标的风险，提出了“假朋友困境”的概念。

Conclusion: 呼吁关注对话搜索中广告的潜在危害，并提出行动建议。

Abstract: Digital commerce thrives on advertising, with many of the largest technology
companies relying on it as a significant source of revenue. However, in the
context of information-seeking behavior, such as search, advertising may
degrade the user experience by lowering search quality, misusing user data for
inappropriate personalization, potentially misleading individuals, or even
leading them toward harm. These challenges remain significant as conversational
search technologies, such as ChatGPT, become widespread. This paper critically
examines the future of advertising in conversational search, utilizing several
speculative examples to illustrate the potential risks posed to users who seek
guidance on sensitive topics. Additionally, it provides an overview of the
forms that advertising might take in this space and introduces the "fake friend
dilemma," the idea that a conversational agent may exploit unaligned user trust
to achieve other objectives. This study presents a provocative discussion on
the future of online advertising in the space of conversational search and ends
with a call to action.

Conclusion: RadioGami为可持续、无电池的交互界面提供了创新解决方案，扩展了纸基射频设备的应用潜力。

Abstract: Paper-based interactive RF devices have opened new possibilities for wireless
sensing, yet they are typically constrained by short operational ranges. This
paper introduces RadioGami, a method for creating long-range, batteryless RF
sensing surfaces on paper using low-cost, DIY materials like copper tape,
paper, and off-the-shelf electronics paired with an affordable radio receiver
(approx. $20). We explore the design space enabled by RadioGami, including
sensing paper deformations like bending, tearing, and origami patterns (Miura,
Kresling) at ranges up to 45.73 meters. RadioGami employs a novel ultra-low
power (35uW) switching circuit with a tunnel diode for wireless functionality.
These surfaces can sustainably operate by harvesting energy using tiny
photodiodes. We demonstrate applications that monitor object status, track user
interactions (rotation, sliding), and detect environmental changes. We
characterize performance, sensitivity, range, and power consumption with
deployment studies. RadioGami advances sustainable, tangible, and batteryless
interfaces for embodied interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着混合现实技术的发展，其潜在滥用问题（如黑暗模式）引发了伦理担忧，需研究其影响并制定对策。

Method: 采用双因素被试内设计，74名参与者观看13个模拟MR城市漫步的视频，分析四种黑暗模式对地点、产品和目标的影响。

Result: 所有黑暗模式均显著降低用户舒适度、增加抗拒感并减少使用意愿，个人或金钱操纵效果最显著。情感与感官操纵及信息隐藏效果相似。

Conclusion: 需重新评估黑暗模式分类，并制定伦理设计指南及工具，以预防沉浸技术中的滥用。

Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) integrates virtual objects with the real world, offering
potential but raising concerns about misuse through dark patterns. This study
explored the effects of four dark patterns, adapted from prior research, and
applied to MR across three targets: places, products, and people. In a
two-factorial within-subject study with 74 participants, we analyzed 13 videos
simulating MR experiences during a city walk. Results show that all dark
patterns significantly reduced user comfort, increased reactance, and decreased
the intention to use MR glasses, with the most disruptive effects linked to
personal or monetary manipulation. Additionally, the dark patterns of Emotional
and Sensory Manipulation and Hiding Information produced similar impacts on the
user in MR, suggesting a re-evaluation of current classifications to go beyond
deceptive design techniques. Our findings highlight the importance of
developing ethical design guidelines and tools to detect and prevent dark
patterns as immersive technologies continue to evolve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI深度伪造技术对生物识别认证构成快速演变的威胁，但公众对其风险的认知与专家存在显著差距，导致系统脆弱性增加。

Method: 通过混合方法研究，调查了408名专业人士，并深入访谈了37名参与者（25名专家，12名非专家），提出了Deepfake Kill Chain模型。

Result: 研究发现公众依赖生物识别的便利性，而专家则担忧静态模态（如面部和语音识别）的欺骗风险，并揭示了不同行业和人群的认知差异。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个三层次缓解框架，结合动态生物信号、数据治理和教育倡议，为防御AI生成的身份威胁提供了实证支持的路线图。

Abstract: Generative AI (Gen-AI) deepfakes pose a rapidly evolving threat to biometric
authentication, yet a significant gap exists between expert understanding of
these risks and public perception. This disconnection creates critical
vulnerabilities in systems trusted by millions. To bridge this gap, we
conducted a comprehensive mixed-method study, surveying 408 professionals
across key sectors and conducting in-depth interviews with 37 participants (25
experts, 12 general public [non-experts]). Our findings reveal a paradox: while
the public increasingly relies on biometrics for convenience, experts express
grave concerns about the spoofing of static modalities like face and voice
recognition. We found significant demographic and sector-specific divides in
awareness and trust, with finance professionals, for example, showing
heightened skepticism. To systematically analyze these threats, we introduce a
novel Deepfake Kill Chain model, adapted from Hutchins et al.'s cybersecurity
frameworks to map the specific attack vectors used by malicious actors against
biometric systems. Based on this model and our empirical findings, we propose a
tri-layer mitigation framework that prioritizes dynamic biometric signals
(e.g., eye movements), robust privacy-preserving data governance, and targeted
educational initiatives. This work provides the first empirically grounded
roadmap for defending against AI-generated identity threats by aligning
technical safeguards with human-centered insights.

Result: 系统平均能耗为4.17 nJ（训练）和0.952 nJ（测试），分类准确率达97.22%（5%噪声下）。

Conclusion: 该架构低能耗且支持能量收集，适用于可持续自主运行，同时增强数据隐私。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel device architecture that merges
memristive devices with light-sensing surfaces, for energy-efficient motion
recognition at the edge. Our light-sensing surface captures motion data through
in-sensor computation. This data is then processed using a memristive system
equipped with a HfO2-based synaptic device, coupled with a winner-take-all
(WTA) circuit, tailored for low-power motion classification tasks. We validate
our end-to-end system using four distinct human hand gestures - left-to-right,
right-to-left, bottom-to-top, and top-to-bottom movements - to assess energy
efficiency and classification robustness. Our experiments show that the system
requires an average of only 4.17 nJ for taking our processed analog signal and
mapping weights onto our memristive system and 0.952 nJ for testing per
movement class, achieving 97.22% accuracy even under 5% noise interference. A
key advantage of our proposed architecture is its low energy requirement,
enabling the integration of energy-harvesting solutions such as solar power for
sustainable autonomous operation. Additionally, our approach enhances data
privacy by processing data locally, reducing the need for external data
transmission and storage.

TL;DR: 研究者开发了一个名为LLM-D12的12项问卷，用于测量人们对大型语言模型（LLM）的依赖程度，分为工具性依赖和关系性依赖两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM依赖的工具较少且基于传统行为成瘾症状，而LLM与人类的关系更为复杂，需要新的视角。

Method: 基于作者的理论工作开发问卷，收集526名英国参与者的数据，通过探索性和验证性因子分析验证量表结构。

Result: 量表支持两因素结构（工具性依赖和关系性依赖），具有良好内部一致性和区分效度。

Conclusion: LLM依赖不一定代表功能障碍，但在某些情境下可能成为问题，LLM-D12为研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large
language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even
addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals
may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic
behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this
as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and
warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed
and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred
to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with
items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in
the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate
halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a
two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship
Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which
individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and
cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs
as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor
structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant
validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the
distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and
structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view
that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still
reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户对当前在线举报系统缺乏透明度和参与感感到不满，这源于系统的审问式特性。对抗性模型能更好地实现程序正义和隐私保护。

Method: 通过文献综述、形成性访谈和威胁建模，探索了对抗性实践在在线举报系统中的潜力。

Result: 提出了支持用户收集和呈现证据的设计，同时减少信息共享和验证证据真实性。

Conclusion: 研究发现可为新型加密工具和在线内容审核的法律框架提供参考。

Abstract: User reporting systems are central to addressing interpersonal conflicts and
protecting users from harm in online spaces, particularly those with heightened
privacy expectations. However, users often express frustration at their lack of
insight and input into the reporting process. Drawing on offline legal
literature, we trace these frustrations to the inquisitorial nature of today's
online reporting systems, where moderators lead evidence gathering and case
development. In contrast, adversarial models can grant users greater control
and thus are better for procedural justice and privacy protection, despite
their increased risks of system abuse. This motivates us to explore the
potential of incorporating adversarial practices into online reporting systems.
Through literature review, formative interviews, and threat modeling, we find a
rich design space for empowering users to collect and present their evidence
while mitigating potential abuse in the reporting process. In particular, we
propose designs that minimize the amount of information shared for reporting
purposes, as well as supporting evidence authentication. Finally, we discuss
how our findings can inform new cryptographic tools and new efforts to apply
comparative legal frameworks to online moderation.

TL;DR: 研究利用耳机形式的EOG眼动追踪技术，解决了传统方法的硬件限制，水平追踪效果显著，但垂直追踪效果较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统眼动追踪技术硬件笨重且复杂，研究旨在开发更轻便、高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用14个电极集成到耳机设备中，通过实验测试水平和垂直眼动追踪效果。

Result: 水平追踪与金标准高度相关（r=0.81），垂直追踪相关性较弱（r=0.28）。

Conclusion: 耳机EOG在水平追踪上表现良好，垂直追踪需进一步改进。

Abstract: Eye tracking technology is frequently utilized to diagnose eye and
neurological disorders, assess sleep and fatigue, study human visual
perception, and enable novel gaze-based interaction methods. However,
traditional eye tracking methodologies are constrained by bespoke hardware that
is often cumbersome to wear, complex to apply, and demands substantial
computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we investigated
Electrooculography (EOG) eye tracking using 14 electrodes positioned around the
ears, integrated into a custom-built headphone form factor device. In a
controlled experiment, 16 participants tracked stimuli designed to induce
smooth pursuits and saccades. Data analysis identified optimal electrode pairs
for vertical and horizontal eye movement tracking, benchmarked against
gold-standard EOG and camera-based methods. The electrode montage nearest the
eyes yielded the best horizontal results. Horizontal smooth pursuits via earEOG
showed high correlation with gold-standard measures ($r_{\mathrm{EOG}} = 0.81,
p = 0.01$; $r_{\mathrm{CAM}} = 0.56, p = 0.02$), while vertical pursuits were
weakly correlated ($r_{\mathrm{EOG}} = 0.28, p = 0.04$; $r_{\mathrm{CAM}} =
0.35, p = 0.05$). Voltage deflections when performing saccades showed strong
correlation in the horizontal direction ($r_{\mathrm{left}} = 0.99, p = 0.0$;
$r_{\mathrm{right}} = 0.99, p = 0.0$) but low correlation in the vertical
direction ($r_{\mathrm{up}} = 0.6, p = 0.23$; $r_{\mathrm{down}} = 0.19, p =
0.73$). Overall, horizontal earEOG demonstrated strong performance, indicating
its potential effectiveness, while vertical earEOG results were poor,
suggesting limited feasibility in our current setup.

Conclusion: 建议未来LLM开发和平台设计需平衡用户赋能与风险控制，以增强信任并减少虚假信息风险。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge in
the fight against disinformation. These powerful tools, capable of generating
human-like text at scale, can be weaponised to produce sophisticated and
persuasive disinformation, yet they also hold promise for enhancing detection
and mitigation strategies. This paper investigates the complex dynamics between
LLMs and disinformation through a communication game that simulates online
forums, inspired by the game Werewolf, with 25 participants. We analyse how
Disinformers, Moderators, and Users leverage LLMs to advance their goals,
revealing both the potential for misuse and combating disinformation. Our
findings highlight the varying uses of LLMs depending on the participants'
roles and strategies, underscoring the importance of understanding their
effectiveness in this context. We conclude by discussing implications for
future LLM development and online platform design, advocating for a balanced
approach that empowers users and fosters trust while mitigating the risks of
LLM-assisted disinformation.

Method: 通过半结构化访谈，研究次要利益相关者如何实现三个参与理想（知情、同意、代理），并分析其面临的系统性障碍。

Result: 提出了三种次要利益相关者原型（不情愿的数据贡献者、无支持的活动家、善意的实践者），揭示了他们在实现代理关系时的挑战。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来AI发展中，次要利益相关者能够更有效地参与并影响AI系统。

Abstract: As AI technologies become more human-facing, there have been numerous calls
to adapt participatory approaches to AI development -- spurring the idea of
participatory AI. However, these calls often focus only on primary
stakeholders, such as end-users, and not secondary stakeholders. This paper
seeks to translate the ideals of participatory AI to a broader population of
secondary AI stakeholders through semi-structured interviews. We theorize that
meaningful participation involves three participatory ideals: (1) informedness,
(2) consent, and (3) agency. We also explore how secondary stakeholders realize
these ideals by traversing a complicated problem space. Like walking up the
rungs of a ladder, these ideals build on one another. We introduce three
stakeholder archetypes: the reluctant data contributor, the unsupported
activist, and the well-intentioned practitioner, who must navigate systemic
barriers to achieving agentic AI relationships. We envision an AI future where
secondary stakeholders are able to meaningfully participate with the AI systems
they influence and are influenced by.

Abstract: Smart contract (SC) fuzzing is a critical technique for detecting
vulnerabilities in blockchain applications. However, its adoption remains
challenging for practitioners due to fundamental differences between SCs and
traditional software systems. In this study, we investigate the challenges
practitioners face when adopting SC fuzzing tools by conducting an inductive
content analysis of 381 GitHub issues from two widely used SC fuzzers: Echidna
and Foundry. Furthermore, we conducted a user study to examine how these
challenges affect different practitioner groups, SC developers, and traditional
software security professionals, and identify strategies practitioners use to
overcome them. We systematically categorize these challenges into a taxonomy
based on their nature and occurrence within the SC fuzzing workflow. Our
findings reveal domain-specific ease-of-use and usefulness challenges,
including technical issues with blockchain emulation, and human issues with a
lack of accessible documentation and process automation. Our results provide
actionable insights for tool developers and researchers, guiding future
improvements in SC fuzzer tool design.

Motivation: 探讨MR和2D视频会议在儿童协作任务中的沟通效果差异，为分布式环境中的协作学习提供优化方向。

Method: 使用Microsoft HoloLens MR和Zoom进行实验，通过LLM分析音频视频数据，实现快速处理和跨语言研究参与。

Result: MR在情感表达和参与度上表现更优，Zoom则更简单易用；LLM分析显著提升效率，但存在标注准确性限制。

Conclusion: MR有潜力提升分布式环境中儿童的协作学习体验，LLM分析为跨语言研究提供了高效工具。

Abstract: This paper explores how Mixed Reality (MR) and 2D video conferencing
influence children's communication during a gesture-based guessing game.
Finnish-speaking participants engaged in a short collaborative task using two
different setups: Microsoft HoloLens MR and Zoom. Audio-video recordings were
transcribed and analyzed using Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling iterative
correction, translation, and annotation. Despite limitations in annotations'
accuracy and agreement, automated approaches significantly reduced processing
time and allowed non-Finnish-speaking researchers to participate in data
analysis. Evaluations highlight both the efficiency and constraints of
LLM-based analyses for capturing children's interactions across these
platforms. Initial findings indicate that MR fosters richer interaction,
evidenced by higher emotional expression during annotation, and heightened
engagement, while Zoom offers simplicity and accessibility. This study
underscores the potential of MR to enhance collaborative learning experiences
for children in distributed settings.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了老龄化人口中游戏玩家的多样性，指出传统游戏无障碍功能的局限性，并提出利用人工智能设计个性化无障碍功能以应对这一挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着老龄化加剧和老年人游戏爱好者的增加，传统无障碍功能无法满足多样化的需求，亟需新的解决方案。

Method: 引入人工智能技术，结合老年学、人机交互和残疾研究的理论，设计个性化的游戏无障碍功能。

Result: 提出了一种基于人工智能的个性化无障碍功能框架，以补充传统功能，提升老年玩家的游戏体验。

Conclusion: 个性化无障碍功能对满足老年玩家的多样化需求至关重要，有助于实现健康老龄化的长期目标。

Abstract: As the population continues to age, and gaming continues to grow as a hobby
for older people, heterogeneity among older adult gamers is increasing. We
argue that traditional game-based accessibility features, such as simplified
input schemes, redundant information channels, and increased legibility of
digital user interfaces, are increasingly limited in the face of this
heterogeneity. This is because such features affect all older adult players
simultaneously and therefore are designed generically. We introduce artificial
intelligence, although it has its own limitations and ethical concerns, as a
method of creating player-based accessibility features, given the adaptive
nature of the emerging technology. These accessibility features may help to
address unique assemblage of accessibility needs an individual may accumulate
through age. We adopt insights from gerontology, HCI, and disability studies
into the digital game design discourse for older adults, and we contribute
insight that can guide the integration of player-based accessibility features
to supplement game-based counterparts. The accessibility of digital games for
heterogenous older adult audience is paramount, as the medium offers short-term
social, emotional, psychological, cognitive, and physical that support the
long-term goal of aging well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年玩家在数字游戏中常被忽视，而AI的辅助能力可能改善其体验。

Method: 通过迭代设计调查，分析39名参与者的反馈，优化调查内容。

Result: 发现游戏可用性问题和AI的实用性与复杂性是老年玩家的主要关注点。

Conclusion: 研究为设计包容老年玩家的AI支持游戏提供了早期见解。

Abstract: With respect to digital games, older adults are a demographic that is often
underserved due to an industry-wide focus on younger audiences' preferences and
skill sets. Meanwhile, as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to expand into
everyday technologies, its assistive capabilities have been recognized,
suggesting its potential in improving the gaming experience for older gamers.
To study this potential, we iteratively developed a pilot survey aimed at
understanding older adult gamers' current gameplay preference, challenges they
are facing, and their perspectives of AI usage in gaming. This article
contributes an overview of our iterative survey-design workflow, and pilot
results from 39 participants. During each iteration, we analyzed the survey's
efficacy and adjusted the content, language, and format to better capture
meaningful data, and was able to create a refined survey for a larger, more
representative future parent study. At the same time, preliminary findings
suggest that for older adult gamers, usability issues in gaming remain key
obstacles, while this demographic's perceptions of AI are shaped by both its
practical benefits and concerns about autonomy and complexity. These findings
also offer early insights for the design of age-inclusive, AI-supported gaming
experiences.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多模态生理信号预测情境意识（SA）的三个层次，展示了其在复杂任务中的有效性，尤其是EEG和眼动信号对预测SA的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情境意识（SA）对人类操作员表现至关重要，但传统测量方法具有干扰性，因此研究寻求生理指标以实时评估SA。

Method: 研究使用多模态神经生理、心理生理和行为信号，结合飞机模拟器任务和SA冻结探针评估，预测SA的三个层次。

Result: 多模态生理模型在预测SA时表现优于随机标签模型，其中EEG和眼动信号对SA的第三层次（预测）和总体SA贡献显著。

Conclusion: 多模态生理信号能非干扰性地预测SA的所有层次，为复杂任务中的SA评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Situation awareness (SA)--comprising the ability to 1) perceive critical
elements in the environment, 2) comprehend their meanings, and 3) project their
future states--is critical for human operator performance. Due to the
disruptive nature of gold-standard SA measures, researchers have sought
physiological indicators to provide real-time information about SA. We extend
prior work by using a multimodal suite of neurophysiological,
psychophysiological, and behavioral signals, predicting all three levels of SA
along a continuum, and predicting a comprehensive measure of SA in a complex
multi-tasking simulation. We present a lab study in which 31 participants
controlled an aircraft simulator task battery while wearing physiological
sensors and responding to SA 'freeze-probe' assessments. We demonstrate the
validity of task and assessment for measuring SA. Multimodal physiological
models predict SA with greater predictive performance ($Q^2$ for levels 1-3 and
total, respectively: 0.14, 0.00, 0.26, and 0.36) than models built with
shuffled labels, demonstrating that multimodal physiological signals provide
useful information in predicting all SA levels. Level 3 SA (projection) was
best predicted, and level 2 SA comprehension) was the most challenging to
predict. Ablation analysis and single sensor models found EEG and eye-tracking
signals to be particularly useful to predictions of level 3 and total SA. A
reduced sensor fusion model showed that predictive performance can be
maintained with a subset of sensors. This first rigorous cross-validation
assessment of predictive performance demonstrates the utility of multimodal
physiological signals for inferring complex, holistic, objective measures of SA
at all levels, non-disruptively, and along a continuum.

Abstract: This study explores the classroom implementation of an AI-powered grading
platform in K-12 settings through a co-design pilot with 19 teachers. We
combine platform usage logs, surveys, and qualitative interviews to examine how

while teachers valued the AI's rapid narrative feedback for formative purposes,
they distrusted automated scoring and emphasized the need for human oversight.
Students welcomed fast, revision-oriented feedback but remained skeptical of
AI-only grading. We discuss implications for the design of trustworthy,
teacher-centered AI assessment tools that enhance feedback while preserving
pedagogical agency.

Abstract: The construction industry is characterized by both high physical and
psychological risks, yet supports of mental health remain limited. While
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language
models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction
remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a
conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges
through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it
fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling
interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach
ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social
engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate
its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12
participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the
single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in
self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings
highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific
support for construction workers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CellCLIP是一种用于高内涵筛选数据的跨模态对比学习框架，通过预训练图像编码器和新型通道编码方案，显著提升了跨模态检索和下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高内涵筛选数据（如Cell Painting）的语义与自然图像差异大，且不同扰动类型（如小分子与CRISPR基因敲除）难以在同一潜在空间表示，因此需要新的方法。

Method: CellCLIP结合预训练图像编码器、新型通道编码方案和自然语言编码器，学习统一的潜在空间以对齐扰动与其形态效应。

Result: CellCLIP在跨模态检索和下游任务中表现最佳，同时显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: CellCLIP为高内涵筛选数据提供了一种高效的跨模态对比学习解决方案。

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are essential tools for solving
planning and scheduling problems across critical industries such as
construction, manufacturing, and logistics. However, their widespread adoption
is limited by long computational times, especially in large-scale, real-time
scenarios. To address this, we present a learning-based framework that
leverages Behavior Cloning (BC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train Graph

warm-starting MILP solvers in Multi-Agent Task Allocation and Scheduling
Problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces optimization

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Mutual-Taught方法，通过自训练迭代优化策略模型和奖励模型，解决分布偏移问题，无需额外人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型偏好优化中，分布偏移会降低奖励模型的效果，进而影响策略模型性能。

Method: 采用类似EM算法的自训练方法，交替更新策略模型和奖励模型。

Result: 实验显示迭代方法显著提升模型性能，8B策略模型在AlpacaEval-2上胜率为54.1%，8B奖励模型性能媲美GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Mutual-Taught方法有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs),
distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the
data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of
the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model
(PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training
method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring
additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the
current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal
preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing
training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update.
This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution.
Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to
consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model,
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on
AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par
with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

Motivation: 银行信用评级对经济稳定和利益相关者决策至关重要，但隐私问题限制了完整银行间连接图的获取，影响了图神经网络的直接应用。

Method: 利用持久同源性构建银行关系网络，与传统借贷网络结合形成异构图，通过HTGNN整合信息进行评级预测。

Result: 在真实全球数据集上的实验验证了HTGNN的有效性，提升了预测准确性。

Conclusion: HTGNN为投资者和监管机构提供了增强风险缓解和市场干预的工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings
that influence economic stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate
and timely predictions support informed decision-making, regulatory actions,
and investor protection. However, a complete interbank connection graph is
often unavailable due to privacy concerns, complicating the direct application
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for rating prediction. our research utilizes
persistent homology to construct a network that captures relationships among
banks and combines this with a traditional lending network to create a
heterogeneous network that integrates information from both sources, leading to
improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world dataset validate the
effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for investors and
regulatory bodies in enhancing proactive risk mitigation and the implementation
of effective market interventions.The code can be find at

Conclusion: GLProtein为蛋白质功能预测提供了更全面的结构信息整合方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

TL;DR: dLLM-Cache是一种无需训练的缓存框架，通过结合长间隔提示缓存和部分响应更新，显著降低了扩散式大语言模型（dLLMs）的推理延迟，实现了高达9.1倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型（dLLMs）在生成文本时具有优势，但存在高推理延迟的问题，且传统ARM加速技术不适用。

Method: 基于dLLM推理中静态提示和部分动态响应的特点，提出dLLM-Cache框架，通过长间隔提示缓存和特征相似性指导的部分响应更新，实现高效计算重用。

Result: 在LLaDA 8B和Dream 7B等模型上，dLLM-Cache实现了高达9.1倍的加速，且不损失输出质量。

Conclusion: dLLM-Cache显著降低了dLLMs的推理延迟，使其接近ARM的延迟水平，为dLLMs的实际应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released
publicly on GitHub.

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN在准确性和收敛速度上优于传统DGCNN，且参数高效。

Conclusion: 多项式阶数并非越高越好，需进一步研究多项式基、阶数与图学习机制的交互。

Abstract: We introduce Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN, a framework that integrates Dynamic Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) with Jacobi Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) for the classification of three-dimensional point clouds. This method
replaces Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers with adaptable univariate
polynomial expansions within a streamlined DGCNN architecture, circumventing
deep levels for both MLP and KAN to facilitate a layer-by-layer comparison. In
comparative experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, KAN layers employing Jacobi
polynomials outperform the traditional linear layer-based DGCNN baseline in
terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that higher polynomial degrees do not
automatically improve performance, highlighting the need for further
theoretical and empirical investigation to fully understand the interactions
between polynomial bases, degrees, and the mechanisms of graph-based learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院超声心动图检查调度面临非确定性因素（如患者缺席、到达时间、检查时长等）和资源不对称约束的挑战。

Method: 通过预处理数据估计患者缺席概率和检查时长分布，建立SimPy离散事件模拟模型，结合Gymnasium库，比较动态分配与预留策略，并应用强化学习优化策略。

Result: 动态分配策略优于预留策略，能更好适应患者变异性；强化学习策略进一步提升了资源管理效率。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的动态资源分配策略可显著提升超声心动图检查的调度效率。

Abstract: Scheduling echocardiographic exams in a hospital presents significant
challenges due to non-deterministic factors (e.g., patient no-shows, patient
arrival times, diverse exam durations, etc.) and asymmetric resource
constraints between fetal and non-fetal patient streams. To address these
challenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of
operational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and
derive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on
these inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using
SimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a
baseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to
evaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which
different proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a
hospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2
ratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation
generally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient
variability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply
reinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic
allocation policy. This RL-based policy is benchmarked against the
best-performing rule-based strategies, allowing us to quantify their
differences and provide actionable insights for improving echo lab efficiency
through intelligent, data-driven resource management.

Motivation: 人类偏好因用户、背景和文化而异，但现有对齐方法假设单一理想行为，导致少数观点被忽视。

Method: 提出学习多奖励函数分布，直接从成对偏好中学习，无需标注者标识或预定义组。

Result: 证明小规模无异常值集合能准确表示多样化偏好分布，实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能更忠实反映多元化价值观，通过改进校准实现更公平的对齐。

Abstract: Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable
behavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and
cultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and
minority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting
diverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward
functions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned
directly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined
groups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft
labels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of
candidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response
matches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a
small outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference
distributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training
heuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through
improved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic
values.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型安全对齐是反应式的，攻击者和防御者分离，导致防御滞后于威胁。Self-RedTeam旨在通过动态协同进化解决这一问题。

Method: 将安全对齐建模为零和博弈，模型交替扮演攻击者和防御者角色，通过奖励模型裁决结果，实现动态协同适应。

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于哈密顿图网络（HGN）的方法，通过随机特征参数构造替代传统迭代优化，显著提升了训练速度（高达600倍），同时保持了物理对称性和约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据驱动建模中物理对称性和约束的挑战，并优化传统图神经网络训练速度慢的问题。

Method: 使用哈密顿图网络（HGN）结合随机特征参数构造，替代传统的梯度下降优化算法（如Adam、RMSProp）。

Result: 在多种模拟中表现稳健，包括3维N体弹簧系统，并能零样本泛化到4096节点系统。

Conclusion: 挑战了传统梯度下降优化算法在物理系统神经网络训练中的主导地位。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems that respect physical symmetries and constraints
remains a fundamental challenge in data-driven modeling. Integrating physical
laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex
N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However,
training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization
algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training,
especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different
optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained
up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative
optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust
performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring systems in up
to 3 dimensions with different geometries, while retaining essential physical
invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. We reveal
that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a
zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work
challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization
algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.

TL;DR: LT-PINNs是一种新型的物理信息神经网络框架，通过参数化拓扑边界曲线，解决了传统PINNs在复杂几何中的局限性，并显著降低了误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs依赖基于密度的拓扑描述，需要手动插值且难以处理复杂几何。LT-PINNs旨在消除这些限制，实现精确的边界优化。

Method: LT-PINNs将拓扑边界曲线的控制变量参数化为可学习参数，并引入边界条件和拓扑损失函数，确保边界清晰准确。

Result: 实验验证了LT-PINNs在多种PDE问题中的准确性和鲁棒性，显著降低了相对L2误差，并能处理任意边界条件。

Conclusion: LT-PINNs在工程优化中具有广泛应用潜力，尤其适用于复杂拓扑和边界问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless
tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal
topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on
density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and
limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose
Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for
boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control
variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs
eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary
determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss
function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary
representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of
LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs),
including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's
equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate
effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent
flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their
engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming
a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results
demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors
compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2)
LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a
wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries
without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.

Result: 实验证明所提方法在通用性和有效性上表现优异。

Conclusion: 结合语言模型先验和学习字符串嵌入空间可以突破传统BBO的限制，为通用BBO算法开辟新路径。

Abstract: The pursuit of universal black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms is a
longstanding goal. However, unlike domains such as language or vision, where
scaling structured data has driven generalization, progress in offline BBO
remains hindered by the lack of unified representations for heterogeneous
numerical spaces. Thus, existing offline BBO approaches are constrained to
single-task and fixed-dimensional settings, failing to achieve cross-domain
universal optimization. Recent advances in language models (LMs) offer a
promising path forward: their embeddings capture latent relationships in a
unifying way, enabling universal optimization across different data types
possible. In this paper, we discuss multiple potential approaches, including an
end-to-end learning framework in the form of next-token prediction, as well as
prioritizing the learning of latent spaces with strong representational
capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, we collect
offline BBO tasks and data from open-source academic works for training.
Experiments demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our proposed
methods. Our findings suggest that unifying language model priors and learning
string embedding space can overcome traditional barriers in universal BBO,
paving the way for general-purpose BBO algorithms. The code is provided at

Motivation: 探索LLM在推理时是否能够通过多轮反馈机制（类似RL）优化任务表现。

Method: 提出ICRL prompting框架，通过多轮提示和数值反馈（奖励）逐步优化LLM的响应。

Result: 在Game of 24、创意写作和ScienceWorld三个基准测试中，ICRL prompting显著优于基线方法，且即使奖励信号由LLM自身生成，性能仍能提升。

Conclusion: ICRL prompting为LLM在推理时优化任务表现提供了新范式，展示了类似RL的行为，具有扩展测试时计算的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving
sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that,
surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a
phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel
multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt
the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

Motivation: 传统红队测试方法在攻击多样性和覆盖范围上存在局限，无法全面评估大型语言模型的安全性。

Method: 提出QDRT框架，通过行为条件训练和开放式的行为重放缓冲区，训练多个专业化攻击者模型。

Result: QDRT生成的攻击更有效且多样化，适用于多种目标模型（如GPT-2、Llama-3等）。

Conclusion: QDRT为自动化红队测试提供了系统化方法，支持大型语言模型的安全部署。

Abstract: Ensuring safety of large language models (LLMs) is important. Red teaming--a
systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.
Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for
comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to
red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue
diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding
similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.
Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts
coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper
introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to
address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through
behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an
open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers
capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk
categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks
that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target
LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the
field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to
automated red-teaming, ultimately supporting the responsible deployment of
LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文比较了五种集成学习模型在葡萄酒质量评估中的表现，推荐了不同场景下的最优模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的葡萄酒质量评估依赖主观的人工品鉴，效率低且不可靠，需要更准确、可重复的自动化方法。

Method: 采用泄漏控制的工作流程，包括数据分割、标准化、重采样、超参数搜索和特征选择，评估五种集成学习模型。

Result: Gradient Boosting准确率最高，但Random Forest性价比最佳；特征选择可显著降低维度且性能损失小。

Conclusion: 推荐Random Forest为生产模型，Gradient Boosting为离线基准，提供了可复现的流程和指标。

Abstract: Accurate and reproducible wine-quality assessment is critical for production
control yet remains dominated by subjective, labour-intensive tasting panels.
We present the first unified benchmark of five ensemble learners (Random
Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on the canonical Vinho
Verde red- and white-wine datasets (1,599 and 4,898 instances, 11
physicochemical attributes). Our leakage-free workflow employs an 80:20
stratified train-test split, five-fold StratifiedGroupKFold within the training
set, per-fold standardisation, SMOTE-Tomek resampling, inverse-frequency cost
weighting, Optuna hyper-parameter search (120-200 trials per model) and a
two-stage feature-selection refit. Final scores on untouched test sets are
reported with weighted F1 as the headline metric. Gradient Boosting achieves
the highest accuracy (weighted F1 0.693 +/- 0.028 for red and 0.664 +/- 0.016
for white), followed within three percentage points by Random Forest and
XGBoost. Limiting each model to its five top-ranked variables lowers
dimensionality by 55 percent while reducing weighted F1 by only 2.6 percentage
points for red and 3.0 percentage points for white, indicating that alcohol,
volatile acidity, sulphates, free SO2 and chlorides capture most predictive
signal. Runtime profiling on an EPYC 9K84/H20 node reveals a steep efficiency
gradient: Gradient Boosting averages 12 h per five-fold study, XGBoost and
LightGBM require 2-3 h, CatBoost 1 h, and Random Forest under 50 min. We
therefore recommend Random Forest as the most cost-effective production model,
XGBoost and LightGBM as GPU-efficient alternatives, and Gradient Boosting as
the accuracy ceiling for offline benchmarking. The fully documented pipeline
and metric set provide a reproducible baseline for future work on imbalanced
multi-class wine-quality prediction.

Abstract: As machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains

and trustworthy models has intensified. Despite the proliferation of local
explanation techniques, including SHAP, LIME, and counterfactual methods, there
exists no standardized, reproducible framework for their comparative
evaluation, particularly in fairness-sensitive settings.
  We introduce ExplainBench, an open-source benchmarking suite for systematic
evaluation of local model explanations across ethically consequential datasets.
ExplainBench provides unified wrappers for popular explanation algorithms,
integrates end-to-end pipelines for model training and explanation generation,
and supports evaluation via fidelity, sparsity, and robustness metrics. The
framework includes a Streamlit-based graphical interface for interactive
exploration and is packaged as a Python module for seamless integration into
research workflows.
  We demonstrate ExplainBench on datasets commonly used in fairness research,
such as COMPAS, UCI Adult Income, and LendingClub, and showcase how different
explanation methods behave under a shared experimental protocol. By enabling
reproducible, comparative analysis of local explanations, ExplainBench advances
the methodological foundations of interpretable machine learning and
facilitates accountability in real-world AI systems.

Conclusion: AALpy为自动机学习提供了高效且灵活的工具，尤其适合状态合并算法的快速实现。

Abstract: AALpy is a well-established open-source automata learning library written in
Python with a focus on active learning of systems with IO behavior. It provides
a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms for different automaton types
ranging from fully deterministic to probabilistic automata. In this work, we
present the recent addition of a generalized implementation of an important
method from the domain of passive automata learning: state-merging in the
red-blue framework. Using a common internal representation for different
automaton types allows for a general and highly configurable implementation of
the red-blue framework. We describe how to define and execute state-merging
algorithms using AALpy, which reduces the implementation effort for
state-merging algorithms mainly to the definition of compatibility criteria and
scoring. This aids the implementation of both existing and novel algorithms. In
particular, defining some existing state-merging algorithms from the literature
with AALpy only takes a few lines of code.

Result: 在多个基准数据集和联邦学习框架上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了联邦学习在非独立同分布数据下的性能，同时保护了数据隐私。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed framework for collaborative model
training over large-scale distributed data, enabling higher performance while
maintaining client data privacy. However, the nature of model aggregation at
the centralized server can result in a performance drop in the presence of
non-IID data across different clients. We remark that training a client locally
on more data than necessary does not benefit the overall performance of all
clients. In this paper, we devise a novel framework that leverages a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to select an optimized amount of data
necessary to train a client model without oversharing information with the
server. Starting without awareness of the client's performance, the DRL agent
utilizes the change in training loss as a reward signal and learns to optimize
the amount of training data necessary for improving the client's performance.
Specifically, after each aggregation round, the DRL algorithm considers the
local performance as the current state and outputs the optimized weights for
each class, in the training data, to be used during the next round of local
training. In doing so, the agent learns a policy that creates an optimized
partition of the local training dataset during the FL rounds. After FL, the
client utilizes the entire local training dataset to further enhance its
performance on its own data distribution, mitigating the non-IID effects of
aggregation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training FL
clients through our algorithm results in superior performance on multiple
benchmark datasets and FL frameworks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management
in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective
decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable
results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with
generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration.
Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling
complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data
fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In
this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the
energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural
foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of
transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We
then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning
for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new
challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical
implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly
expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend:
Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in
high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and
grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these
developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a
next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and
social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.

Conclusion: 论文总结了关键应用领域和未充分探索的方向，并提出了未来研究的开放挑战，为极端事件合成数据研究提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are
rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across
interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize
losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful
capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data,
yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing
surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than
extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first
overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically
review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly
those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and
sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize
benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering
statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central
contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in
extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for
model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and
identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes,
windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges,
providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.

Result: 实验表明，基于正交变换的编码方法在泛化和外推方面优于传统的正弦编码方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为自然语言处理、计算机视觉等领域中Transformer的设计选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Positional encodings are a core part of transformer-based models, enabling
processing of sequential data without recurrence. This paper presents a
theoretical framework to analyze how various positional encoding methods,
including sinusoidal, learned, relative, and bias-based methods like Attention
with Linear Biases (ALiBi), impact a transformer's expressiveness,
generalization ability, and extrapolation to longer sequences. Expressiveness
is defined via function approximation, generalization bounds are established
using Rademacher complexity, and new encoding methods based on orthogonal
functions, such as wavelets and Legendre polynomials, are proposed. The
extrapolation capacity of existing and proposed encodings is analyzed,
extending ALiBi's biasing approach to a unified theoretical context.
Experimental evaluation on synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks shows that
orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal
encodings in generalization and extrapolation. This work addresses a critical
gap in transformer theory, providing insights for design choices in natural
language processing, computer vision, and other transformer applications.

Motivation: 现有方法（如NMF）未结合生存信息，限制了预测能力。

Method: 使用非负张量分解（NTF）构建加权协变量张量，结合Coxnet模型的生存概率指导分解。

Result: CoxNTF预测性能与原始协变量的Coxnet相当，同时提供结构化聚类框架，有效处理特征冗余。

Conclusion: CoxNTF是生存分析中联合聚类和预测的有力工具。

Abstract: The interpretation of the results of survival analysis often benefits from
latent factor representations of baseline covariates. However, existing
methods, such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), do not incorporate
survival information, limiting their predictive power. We present CoxNTF, a
novel approach that uses non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) to derive
meaningful latent representations that are closely associated with survival
outcomes. CoxNTF constructs a weighted covariate tensor in which survival
probabilities derived from the Coxnet model are used to guide the tensorization
process. Our results show that CoxNTF achieves survival prediction performance
comparable to using Coxnet with the original covariates, while providing a
structured and interpretable clustering framework. In addition, the new
approach effectively handles feature redundancy, making it a powerful tool for
joint clustering and prediction in survival analysis.

Motivation: 传统显式表示（如对象描述符或3D分割图）存在离散、易产生空洞和噪声的问题，限制了新类别的发现。

Result: 在NYUv2和Replica数据集上显著优于现有方法，无需密集标注或人工干预。

Conclusion: NeurNCD为开放世界中的新类别发现提供了高效、数据友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world
applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors
or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and
noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these
challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient
framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed
Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for
traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and
entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica
datasets.

Abstract: Several machine learning algorithms have been developed for the prediction of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) from spontaneous speech.
However, none of these algorithms have been translated for the prediction of
broader cognitive impairment (CI), which in some cases is a precursor and risk
factor of ADRD. In this paper, we evaluated several speech-based open-source
methods originally proposed for the prediction of ADRD, as well as methods from
multimodal sentiment analysis for the task of predicting CI from patient audio
recordings. Results demonstrated that multimodal methods outperformed unimodal
ones for CI prediction, and that acoustics-based approaches performed better
than linguistics-based ones. Specifically, interpretable acoustic features
relating to affect and prosody were found to significantly outperform
BERT-based linguistic features and interpretable linguistic features,
respectively. All the code developed for this study is available at

Conclusion: 充分利用分子编码器的各层表示可显著提升性能与计算效率，建议采用评估后微调的策略。

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational
chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation.
However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for
downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge
this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five
diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our
results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently
outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings
from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an
average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to
these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%,
with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation
between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an
efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal
layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance
of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve
substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出SAFFRON方法，通过推理扩展增强LLM安全性，解决传统方法在安全场景下的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全保证方法易受攻击，推理扩展虽提升LLM推理能力，但在安全领域未充分探索。

Method: 提出SAFFRON框架，引入多叉奖励模型（MRM）减少评估次数，结合部分监督训练、保守探索约束和Trie缓存策略。

Result: 实验验证SAFFRON有效性，并公开模型Saffron-1和数据集Safety4M。

Conclusion: SAFFRON为LLM安全提供高效解决方案，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision
training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to
prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value
caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree
search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model
(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)
to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-BATS是一种高效的无反向传播测试时间适应框架，专为语音基础模型设计，通过轻量级提示适应、多尺度损失和测试时间指数移动平均机制，平衡了适应效果和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音基础模型在现实场景中因声学域偏移（如背景噪声和口音）性能下降，现有测试时间适应方法要么内存消耗大，要么准确性低。

Method: E-BATS包含三个关键组件：轻量级提示适应、多尺度损失和测试时间指数移动平均机制。

Result: 在四个噪声语音数据集上的实验表明，E-BATS比无反向传播基线准确率提高4.1%-13.5%，内存节省2.0-6.4倍。

Conclusion: E-BATS为实际语音处理系统提供了高效且鲁棒的适应方法，适用于现实环境中的声学变化。

Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when
deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as
background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently
emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time
without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA
approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are
memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and
resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer
improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they
are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from
speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing
unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the
first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for
speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation
effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i)
lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii)
a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local
distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving
average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments
conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions
demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over
backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to
backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under
acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient
adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world
environments.

Motivation: 传统cMAB算法需要大样本且可能忽略心理因素，因此结合LLM以提升个性化干预效果。

Method: 采用cMAB选择干预类型，LLM个性化消息内容，评估四种干预类型和四种模型的效果。

Result: 通过因果推断框架评估，发现cMAB和LLM结合在促进体育活动方面具有互补作用。

Conclusion: cMAB与LLM结合的方法为个性化行为干预提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning approaches, such as contextual multi-armed bandit (cMAB)
algorithms, offer a promising strategy to reduce sedentary behavior by
delivering personalized interventions to encourage physical activity. However,
cMAB algorithms typically require large participant samples to learn
effectively and may overlook key psychological factors that are not explicitly
encoded in the model. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines
cMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to
personalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral
self-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each
delivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical
activity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using
dynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy,
social influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants
receive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone,
combined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization
(RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via
ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework
to evaluate the effects of each model. Our findings offer new insights into the
complementary roles of LLM-based personalization and cMAB adaptation in
promoting physical activity through personalized behavioral messaging.

Abstract: Real-world time series are often governed by complex nonlinear dynamics.
Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future
prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series
forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear
dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical
dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel
deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs
kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging
efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate
prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as
well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is
robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting
accuracy. Our code is available at: https://abrarmajeedi.github.io/deep_edm.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效平衡了驾驶舒适性和效率，为自动驾驶中的乘客福祉提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving
comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep,
is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp
maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and
parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the
integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving
behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In
particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to
varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively
synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM)
and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the
relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse
traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the
wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data
from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving
aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control
strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and
overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution
significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while
preserving desirable travel efficiency.

Abstract: While predictive accuracy is often prioritized in machine learning (ML)

integrates class probability and normalized attributions. WISCA consistently
aligned with the most reliable individual method, underscoring the value of
robust consensus strategies in improving explanation reliability.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various
real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV
systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained
environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of
multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we
consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate,
and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow.
Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and
collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an
LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard
each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework
leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both
high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This
knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of
next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system
rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates
compared to baseline approaches.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is an essential task with wide real-world
applications across domains. While recent advances in deep learning have
enabled time-series forecasting models with accurate predictions, there remains
considerable debate over which architectures and design components, such as
series decomposition or normalization, are most effective under varying
conditions. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate models at a high level,
offering limited insight into why certain designs work better. To mitigate this
gap, we propose TimeRecipe, a unified benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates time-series forecasting methods at the module level.
TimeRecipe conducts over 10,000 experiments to assess the effectiveness of
individual components across a diverse range of datasets, forecasting horizons,
and task settings. Our results reveal that exhaustive exploration of the design
space can yield models that outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and
uncover meaningful intuitions linking specific design choices to forecasting
scenarios. Furthermore, we release a practical toolkit within TimeRecipe that
recommends suitable model architectures based on these empirical insights. The

Conclusion: 该方法在无需原始数据的情况下，实现了强隐私保证和模型实用性。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of data privacy regulations, the ability to erase
private or copyrighted information from trained models has become a crucial
requirement. Traditional unlearning methods often assume access to the complete
training dataset, which is unrealistic in scenarios where the source data is no
longer available. To address this challenge, we propose a certified unlearning
framework that enables effective data removal \final{without access to the
original training data samples}. Our approach utilizes a surrogate dataset that
approximates the statistical properties of the source data, allowing for
controlled noise scaling based on the statistical distance between the two.
\updated{While our theoretical guarantees assume knowledge of the exact
statistical distance, practical implementations typically approximate this
distance, resulting in potentially weaker but still meaningful privacy
guarantees.} This ensures strong guarantees on the model's behavior
post-unlearning while maintaining its overall utility. We establish theoretical
bounds, introduce practical noise calibration techniques, and validate our
method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our approach in
privacy-sensitive settings.

Result: 分位数回归攻击在类丢失设置下表现优于影子模型攻击，例如在CIFAR-100上TPR提高了11倍，在ImageNet上即使移除90%的训练类仍能取得显著效果。

Conclusion: 分位数回归攻击在极端分布偏移情况下更具优势，为成员推理攻击提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Shadow model attacks are the state-of-the-art approach for membership
inference attacks on machine learning models. However, these attacks typically
assume an adversary has access to a background (nonmember) data distribution
that matches the distribution the target model was trained on. We initiate a
study of membership inference attacks where the adversary or auditor cannot
access an entire subclass from the distribution -- a more extreme but realistic
version of distribution shift than has been studied previously. In this
setting, we first show that the performance of shadow model attacks degrades
catastrophically, and then demonstrate the promise of another approach,
quantile regression, that does not have the same limitations. We show that
quantile regression attacks consistently outperform shadow model attacks in the
class dropout setting -- for example, quantile regression attacks achieve up to
11$\times$ the TPR of shadow models on the unseen class on CIFAR-100, and
achieve nontrivial TPR on ImageNet even with 90% of training classes removed.
We also provide a theoretical model that illustrates the potential and
limitations of this approach.

is introduced. Leveraging a physics-informed reinforcement learning framework
with Monte Carlo sampling, PIESMC delivers efficient cycle construction with
reduced computational cost. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that PIESMC replicates key kinematic and energy metrics, achieving
up to a 57.3% reduction in cumulative kinematic fragment errors compared to the
Micro-trip-based (MTB) method and a 10.5% reduction relative to the

Conclusion: AGF为理解神经网络特征学习提供了新视角，是迈向全面理解的重要一步。

Abstract: What features neural networks learn, and how, remains an open question. In
this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic
framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks
trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in
this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus
where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons
rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step
process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a
cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each
round, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and
a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these
drops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and
extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks
and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular
modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we
prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.
Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give
the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that
networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.
Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning
in neural networks.

Result: 生成2000万对数据，模型性能提升24%；发现高质量数据提升分布内性能，多样性数据增强分布外泛化。

Conclusion: SPARQ方法有效，且模型和数据规模定律对下游泛化有积极影响。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a
powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most
methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use
natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality.
This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse
problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem
Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for
generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs
using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for
problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate
over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the
generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the
resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally,
we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality
and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured
by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further,
while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit
in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more
robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data
scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit
downstream model generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了随机任务顺序下的可实现持续线性回归，通过两种正则化方案缩小了理论上的性能差距，并提出了最优收敛速率的调度策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习理论中，随机任务顺序下的最坏情况损失下界为Ω(1/k)，但现有方法的理论上界仅为O(1/k^{1/4})，存在显著差距。论文旨在通过正则化方案缩小或消除这一差距。

Method: 使用两种正则化方案：(1)显式各向同性ℓ2正则化，(2)通过有限步预算的隐式正则化，将其转化为对代理损失的随机梯度下降(SGD)。进一步分析时变函数的广义SGD变体，提出最优调度策略。

Result: 固定正则化强度达到接近最优的收敛速率O(log k / k)，而递增的正则化强度调度则实现了最优速率O(1/k)。

Conclusion: 研究表明，增加正则化系数或减少每任务步数的调度策略在理论上是有益的，尤其是在最坏情况下。

Abstract: We study realizable continual linear regression under random task orderings,
a common setting for developing continual learning theory. In this setup, the
worst-case expected loss after $k$ learning iterations admits a lower bound of
$\Omega(1/k)$. However, prior work using an unregularized scheme has only
established an upper bound of $O(1/k^{1/4})$, leaving a significant gap. Our
paper proves that this gap can be narrowed, or even closed, using two
frequently used regularization schemes: (1) explicit isotropic $\ell_2$
regularization, and (2) implicit regularization via finite step budgets. We
show that these approaches, which are used in practice to mitigate forgetting,
reduce to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on carefully defined surrogate
losses. Through this lens, we identify a fixed regularization strength that
yields a near-optimal rate of $O(\log k / k)$. Moreover, formalizing and
analyzing a generalized variant of SGD for time-varying functions, we derive an
increasing regularization strength schedule that provably achieves an optimal
rate of $O(1/k)$. This suggests that schedules that increase the regularization
coefficient or decrease the number of steps per task are beneficial, at least
in the worst case.

Motivation: 解决在资源有限的IoT平台上，深度神经网络（DNNs）训练计算和内存需求高的问题。

Method: 通过优化参数高效微调（PEFT）中的前向和反向计算，实现超快速CNN微调。

Result: 实验显示，InstantFT比现有LoRA方法快17.4倍，微调时间仅0.36秒，能源效率提升16.3倍。

Conclusion: InstantFT能够实时适应非稳态数据分布，适用于IoT设备。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) requires significantly more computation
and memory than inference, making runtime adaptation of DNNs challenging on
resource-limited IoT platforms. We propose InstantFT, an FPGA-based method for
ultra-fast CNN fine-tuning on IoT devices, by optimizing the forward and
backward computations in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Experiments on
datasets with concept drift demonstrate that InstantFT fine-tunes a pre-trained
CNN 17.4x faster than existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based approaches,
while achieving comparable accuracy. Our FPGA-based InstantFT reduces the
fine-tuning time to just 0.36s and improves energy-efficiency by 16.3x,
enabling on-the-fly adaptation of CNNs to non-stationary data distributions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the gap-dependent regret bounds for episodic MDPs. We show that
the Monotonic Value Propagation (MVP) algorithm achieves a variance-aware
gap-dependent regret bound of $$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0}
\frac{H^2 \log K \land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}
+\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)=0}\frac{ H^2 \land
\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_{\mathrm{min}}} + SAH^4 (S \lor H)
\right) \log K\right),$$ where $H$ is the planning horizon, $S$ is the number
of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $K$ is the number of episodes.
Here, $\Delta_h(s,a) =V_h^* (a) - Q_h^* (s, a)$ represents the suboptimality
gap and $\Delta_{\mathrm{min}} := \min_{\Delta_h (s,a) > 0} \Delta_h(s,a)$. The
term $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ denotes the maximum conditional total
variance, calculated as the maximum over all $(\pi, h, s)$ tuples of the
expected total variance under policy $\pi$ conditioned on trajectories visiting
state $s$ at step $h$. $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ characterizes the
maximum randomness encountered when learning any $(h, s)$ pair. Our result
stems from a novel analysis of the weighted sum of the suboptimality gap and
can be potentially adapted for other algorithms. To complement the study, we
establish a lower bound of $$\Omega \left( \sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0} \frac{H^2
\land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}\cdot \log K\right),$$
demonstrating the necessity of dependence on $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$
even when the maximum unconditional total variance (without conditioning on
$(h, s)$) approaches zero.

TL;DR: GeoClip是一种几何感知框架，通过变换梯度分布的基础来优化DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪和扰动，显著提升隐私与效用的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DP-SGD中梯度裁剪阈值设置的挑战，现有方法未能考虑梯度坐标间的相关性。

Method: 提出GeoClip框架，在变换后的基础上裁剪和扰动梯度，自适应估计变换且不增加隐私成本。

Result: 实验表明，GeoClip在相同隐私预算下优于现有自适应裁剪方法。

Conclusion: GeoClip通过几何感知的梯度处理，显著提升了DP-SGD的性能。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most
widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy
guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient
clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy
and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting
this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system
and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We
propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients
in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution.
GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released
noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence
guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal
transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the
probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and
image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing
adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SDN的虚假数据检测与缓解系统（FDDMS），用于实时监测和防御车载网络中的虚假数据注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶和互联车辆的发展，车载网络中电子控制单元（ECU）的通信安全至关重要，需防止虚假数据注入攻击。

Method: 利用SDN技术，结合LSTM检测模型，设计FDDMS系统，并通过改进的DeepFool攻击评估其鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，FDDMS能有效实时检测和缓解虚假数据注入攻击。

Conclusion: FDDMS系统在对抗攻击中表现出鲁棒性，为车载网络安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As the development of autonomous and connected vehicles advances, the
complexity of modern vehicles increases, with numerous Electronic Control Units
(ECUs) integrated into the system. In an in-vehicle network, these ECUs
communicate with one another using an standard protocol called Controller Area
Network (CAN). Securing communication among ECUs plays a vital role in
maintaining the safety and security of the vehicle. This paper proposes a
robust SDN-based False Data Detection and Mitigation System (FDDMS) for
in-vehicle networks. Leveraging the unique capabilities of Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), FDDMS is designed to monitor and detect false data injection
attacks in real-time. Specifically, we focus on brake-related ECUs within an
SDN-enabled in-vehicle network. First, we decode raw CAN data to create an
attack model that illustrates how false data can be injected into the system.
Then, FDDMS, incorporating a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based detection
model, is used to identify false data injection attacks. We further propose an
effective variant of DeepFool attack to evaluate the model's robustness. To
countermeasure the impacts of four adversarial attacks including Fast gradient
descent method, Basic iterative method, DeepFool, and the DeepFool variant, we
further enhance a re-training technique method with a threshold based selection
strategy. Finally, a mitigation scheme is implemented to redirect attack
traffic by dynamically updating flow rules through SDN. Our experimental
results show that the proposed FDDMS is robust against adversarial attacks and
effectively detects and mitigates false data injection attacks in real-time.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖顶点和边特征，无法捕捉基本图结构信息，需要更强大的描述符。

Method: 提出SpectRe，将谱信息融入持久同调图，并分析其全局和局部稳定性。

Result: SpectRe在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，提升了图模型的学习能力。

Conclusion: SpectRe是一种更强大的拓扑描述符，为图表示学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances
the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods
are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context,
recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and
edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on
features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural
information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor
for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably,
SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We
also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing
descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe
and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant
learning tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了语言模型（LMs）在计算资源受限环境下的高效推理策略，重点介绍了路由和级联推理两种方法，以减少计算成本并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其推理过程计算成本高且耗能大，限制了在资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: 论文提出了两种策略：(i) 路由：根据查询选择最合适的模型；(ii) 级联推理：通过一系列模型逐步处理查询，直至获得可靠响应。

Result: 这些方法能够显著减少计算资源的使用，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括更快响应时间、基于任务复杂度的自适应模型选择，以及跨异构环境的可扩展部署。

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

Motivation: 拓扑深度学习（TDL）在建模关系数据中的高阶交互方面表现出强大能力，但拓扑消息传递中的过度压缩现象缺乏理论分析。

Method: 通过将单纯和胞腔复形及其消息传递方案视为关系结构，扩展图论结果和算法到高阶结构。

Abstract: Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
higher-order interactions in relational data. However, phenomena such as
oversquashing in topological message-passing remain understudied and lack
theoretical analysis. We propose a unifying axiomatic framework that bridges
graph and topological message-passing by viewing simplicial and cellular
complexes and their message-passing schemes through the lens of relational
structures. This approach extends graph-theoretic results and algorithms to
higher-order structures, facilitating the analysis and mitigation of
oversquashing in topological message-passing networks. Through theoretical
analysis and empirical studies on simplicial networks, we demonstrate the
potential of this framework to advance TDL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管EM算法及其变种梯度EM在实践中广泛应用，但在精确参数化设置下（即学习模型与真实模型组件数相同），仅对m=2的情况有全局收敛性证明，而对m≥3时EM算法会失败。因此，论文探索了过参数化设置（学习模型组件数多于真实模型）下的收敛性。

Method: 论文采用梯度EM算法，利用Hermite多项式分析其动态特性，并通过张量分解刻画似然损失的几何景观。

Result: 对于任何良好分离且处于一般位置的高斯混合模型，仅需轻度过参数化（n=Ω(mlogm)），随机初始化的梯度EM算法能以多项式速率全局收敛到真实参数。

Conclusion: 这是首次在m=2之外的情况下，为EM或梯度EM算法提供全局收敛性和恢复性结果，为高斯混合模型分析提供了新的工具和理论支持。

Abstract: Learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and its popular
variant gradient EM being arguably the most widely used algorithms in practice.
In the exact-parameterized setting, where both the ground truth GMM and the
learning model have the same number of components $m$, a vast line of work has
aimed to establish rigorous recovery guarantees for EM. However, global
convergence has only been proven for the case of $m=2$, and EM is known to fail
to recover the ground truth when $m\geq 3$.
  In this paper, we consider the $\textit{over-parameterized}$ setting, where
the learning model uses $n>m$ components to fit an $m$-component ground truth
GMM. In contrast to the exact-parameterized case, we provide a rigorous global
convergence guarantee for gradient EM. Specifically, for any well separated
GMMs in general position, we prove that with only mild over-parameterization $n
= \Omega(m\log m)$, randomly initialized gradient EM converges globally to the
ground truth at a polynomial rate with polynomial samples. Our analysis
proceeds in two stages and introduces a suite of novel tools for Gaussian
Mixture analysis. We use Hermite polynomials to study the dynamics of gradient
EM and employ tensor decomposition to characterize the geometric landscape of
the likelihood loss. This is the first global convergence and recovery result
for EM or Gradient EM beyond the special case of $m=2$.

Motivation: 标准共形预测的校准方法通常生成较大的预测集，限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: 将共形训练建模为一个双层优化问题，提出DPSM算法，通过最小化预测集大小的度量（上层）和基于学习的一致性分数分位数（下层）来实现。

Result: DPSM在多个基准数据集和深度模型上表现优异，预测集大小减少了20.46%，验证了其理论优势。

Conclusion: DPSM通过直接优化预测集大小，显著提升了共形预测的实用性，为不确定性量化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising uncertainty quantification framework
which works as a wrapper around a black-box classifier to construct prediction
sets (i.e., subset of candidate classes) with provable guarantees. However,
standard calibration methods for CP tend to produce large prediction sets which
makes them less useful in practice. This paper considers the problem of
integrating conformal principles into the training process of deep classifiers
to directly minimize the size of prediction sets. We formulate conformal
training as a bilevel optimization problem and propose the {\em Direct
Prediction Set Minimization (DPSM)} algorithm to solve it. The key insight
behind DPSM is to minimize a measure of the prediction set size (upper level)
that is conditioned on the learned quantile of conformity scores (lower level).
We analyze that DPSM has a learning bound of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ (with $n$ training
samples), while prior conformal training methods based on stochastic
approximation for the quantile has a bound of $\Omega(1/s)$ (with batch size
$s$ and typically $s \ll \sqrt{n}$). Experiments on various benchmark datasets
and deep models show that DPSM significantly outperforms the best prior
conformal training baseline with $20.46\%\downarrow$ in the prediction set size
and validates our theory.

Abstract: While popular optimization methods such as SGD, AdamW, and Lion depend on
steepest descent updates in either $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$ norms, there
remains a critical gap in handling the non-Euclidean structure observed in
modern deep networks training. In this work, we address this need by
introducing a new accelerated $\ell_p$ steepest descent algorithm, called
Stacey, which uses interpolated primal-dual iterate sequences to effectively
navigate non-Euclidean smooth optimization tasks. In addition to providing
novel theoretical guarantees for the foundations of our algorithm, we
empirically compare our approach against these popular methods on tasks
including image classification and language model (LLM) pretraining,
demonstrating both faster convergence and higher final accuracy. We further
evaluate different values of $p$ across various models and datasets,
underscoring the importance and efficiency of non-Euclidean approaches over
standard Euclidean methods. Code can be found at

Motivation: 现有研究表明，单独使用RL提升语言模型在复杂任务上的推理能力效果有限，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用从易到难的任务调度（E2H），逐步构建模型的推理能力，并通过理论分析确保收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，E2H Reasoner显著提升了小型语言模型（1.5B至3B）的推理能力，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: E2H Reasoner是一种有效的提升语言模型推理能力的方法，尤其适用于小型模型。

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

Abstract: The discovery of the lazy neuron phenomenon in trained Transformers, where
the vast majority of neurons in their feed-forward networks (FFN) are inactive
for each token, has spurred tremendous interests in activation sparsity for
enhancing large model efficiency. While notable progress has been made in
translating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved
away from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing
efforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,
increase parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,
the application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces
similar challenges.
  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that
achieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention
mechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard
training procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for
explicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical
top-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that
avoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard
top-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN
parameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for
identifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from
enforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the
Gemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on
standard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN
neurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens. This
sparsity translates to a 2.5x reduction in FLOPs, leading to decoding wall-time
speedups of up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.

*Yishan Shen,Yuyang Ye,Hui Xiong,Yong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFER是一个结合结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记的风险感知推荐框架，用于动态治疗策略（DTR），通过统计保证提供安全治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTR方法依赖临床医生规定的金标准，且未充分利用临床笔记，限制了治疗建议的可靠性。

Method: SAFER整合结构化数据和临床笔记，利用共形预测提供统计保证，并处理标签不确定性。

Result: 在公开的脓毒症数据集上，SAFER在推荐指标和反事实死亡率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAFER是一个可信赖且理论扎实的高风险DTR解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are critical to precision medicine,
optimizing long-term outcomes through personalized, real-time decision-making
in evolving clinical contexts, but require careful supervision for unsafe
treatment risks. Existing efforts rely primarily on clinician-prescribed gold
standards despite the absence of a known optimal strategy, and predominantly
using structured EHR data without extracting valuable insights from clinical
notes, limiting their reliability for treatment recommendations. In this work,
we introduce SAFER, a calibrated risk-aware tabular-language recommendation
framework for DTR that integrates both structured EHR and clinical notes,
enabling them to learn from each other, and addresses inherent label
uncertainty by assuming ambiguous optimal treatment solution for deceased
patients. Moreover, SAFER employs conformal prediction to provide statistical
guarantees, ensuring safe treatment recommendations while filtering out
uncertain predictions. Experiments on two publicly available sepsis datasets
demonstrate that SAFER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple
recommendation metrics and counterfactual mortality rate, while offering robust
formal assurances. These findings underscore SAFER potential as a trustworthy
and theoretically grounded solution for high-stakes DTR applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了RIF方法，作为IF的改进，显著提高了数据归因的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究训练数据如何影响模型行为，特别是IF在高维情况下不精确的问题。

Method: 提出RIF方法，作为IF的替代方案，计算开销小但精度更高。

Result: 实验表明RIF在真实数据集上预测效果显著优于IF。

Conclusion: RIF能更准确地预测数据影响，并能检测IF无法识别的数据投毒攻击。

Abstract: How does the training data affect a model's behavior? This is the question we
seek to answer with data attribution. The leading practical approaches to data
attribution are based on influence functions (IF). IFs utilize a first-order
Taylor approximation to efficiently predict the effect of removing a set of
samples from the training set without retraining the model, and are used in a
wide variety of machine learning applications. However, especially in the
high-dimensional regime (# params $\geq \Omega($# samples$)$), they are often
imprecise and tend to underestimate the effect of sample removals, even for
simple models such as logistic regression. We present rescaled influence
functions (RIF), a new tool for data attribution which can be used as a drop-in
replacement for influence functions, with little computational overhead but
significant improvement in accuracy. We compare IF and RIF on a range of
real-world datasets, showing that RIFs offer significantly better predictions
in practice, and present a theoretical analysis explaining this improvement.
Finally, we present a simple class of data poisoning attacks that would fool
IF-based detections but would be detected by RIF.

*Hong-Ming Chiu,Hao Chen,Huan Zhang,Richard Y. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDP-CROWN结合了SDP的紧致性和线性边界传播的可扩展性，显著提升了大规模神经网络的验证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性边界传播验证器在神经元耦合时表现松散，而SDP验证器虽紧致但计算复杂度高，无法应用于大规模模型。

Method: 提出SDP-CROWN框架，通过SDP原理推导新的线性边界，显式捕获神经元间的耦合，同时保持可扩展性。

Result: 理论证明新边界比传统方法紧致√n倍，实践验证在大型模型上性能显著提升，接近SDP方法的紧致性。

Conclusion: SDP-CROWN成功结合了SDP的紧致性和线性边界传播的可扩展性，为大规模神经网络验证提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network verifiers based on linear bound propagation scale impressively
to massive models but can be surprisingly loose when neuron coupling is
crucial. Conversely, semidefinite programming (SDP) verifiers capture
inter-neuron coupling naturally, but their cubic complexity restricts them to
only small models. In this paper, we propose SDP-CROWN, a novel hybrid
verification framework that combines the tightness of SDP relaxations with the
scalability of bound-propagation verifiers. At the core of SDP-CROWN is a new
linear bound, derived via SDP principles, that explicitly captures
$\ell_{2}$-norm-based inter-neuron coupling while adding only one extra
parameter per layer. This bound can be integrated seamlessly into any linear
bound-propagation pipeline, preserving the inherent scalability of such methods
yet significantly improving tightness. In theory, we prove that our
inter-neuron bound can be up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ tighter than traditional
per-neuron bounds. In practice, when incorporated into the state-of-the-art
$\alpha$-CROWN verifier, we observe markedly improved verification performance
on large models with up to 65 thousand neurons and 2.47 million parameters,
achieving tightness that approaches that of costly SDP-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线突破传球（LBPs）是足球中关键的战术行为，能够穿透防线并进入高价值区域，但缺乏系统化的分析方法。

Method: 通过垂直空间分割建模对手队形，并识别开放比赛中破坏防线的传球。引入了空间构建比（SBR）和两种链式指标（LBPCh^1和LBPCh^2）来量化LBPs的效果。

Result: 在2022年世界杯中评估了这些指标，揭示了不同球队和球员在垂直推进和结构破坏上的风格差异。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可解释性、可扩展性，可直接应用于现代比赛分析和球探工作流程。

Abstract: Line-breaking passes (LBPs) are crucial tactical actions in football,
allowing teams to penetrate defensive lines and access high-value spaces. In
this study, we present an unsupervised, clustering-based framework for
detecting and analysing LBPs using synchronised event and tracking data from
elite matches. Our approach models opponent team shape through vertical spatial
segmentation and identifies passes that disrupt defensive lines within open
play. Beyond detection, we introduce several tactical metrics, including the
space build-up ratio (SBR) and two chain-based variants, LBPCh$^1$ and
LBPCh$^2$, which quantify the effectiveness of LBPs in generating immediate or
sustained attacking threats. We evaluate these metrics across teams and players
in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, revealing stylistic differences in vertical
progression and structural disruption. The proposed methodology is explainable,
scalable, and directly applicable to modern performance analysis and scouting
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合框架在同构图中表现良好，但在异构图和语义稀疏场景中面临共享编码器设计、视图构建困难和梯度不平衡等挑战。

Method: 提出HetCRF框架，采用两阶段聚合策略适应嵌入语义，增强编码器输出以改进视图构建，并提出两种正样本增强策略平衡梯度贡献。

Result: 在四个真实异构图数据集上的节点分类实验中，HetCRF在缺失节点特征的情况下（如Aminer和Freebase），Macro-F1分数分别提升了2.75%和2.2%。

Conclusion: HetCRF通过结合MAE和CL的优势，在异构图自监督学习中表现出色，验证了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: In graph self-supervised learning, masked autoencoders (MAE) and contrastive
learning (CL) are two prominent paradigms. MAE focuses on reconstructing masked
elements, while CL maximizes similarity between augmented graph views. Recent
studies highlight their complementarity: MAE excels at local feature capture,
and CL at global information extraction. Hybrid frameworks for homogeneous
graphs have been proposed, but face challenges in designing shared encoders to
meet the semantic requirements of both tasks. In semantically sparse scenarios,
CL struggles with view construction, and gradient imbalance between positive
and negative samples persists. This paper introduces HetCRF, a novel
dual-channel self-supervised learning framework for heterogeneous graphs.
HetCRF uses a two-stage aggregation strategy to adapt embedding semantics,
making it compatible with both MAE and CL. To address semantic sparsity, it
enhances encoder output for view construction instead of relying on raw
features, improving efficiency. Two positive sample augmentation strategies are
also proposed to balance gradient contributions. Node classification
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HetCRF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. On datasets with missing node
features, such as Aminer and Freebase, at a 40% label rate in node
classification, HetCRF improves the Macro-F1 score by 2.75% and 2.2%
respectively compared to the second-best baseline, validating its effectiveness
and superiority.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动性数据隐私敏感且分散，难以构建通用基础模型。MoveGCL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用生成式持续学习，通过冻结教师模型生成合成轨迹，结合知识蒸馏和Mixture-of-Experts Transformer。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上表现接近联合训练，显著优于联邦学习，同时保护隐私。

Conclusion: MoveGCL为移动性基础模型提供了开放、可扩展且隐私保护的开发蓝图。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language
processing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across
diverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human
mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility
data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we
propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training
mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing
raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by
replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and
reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that
mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility
patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a
mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive
adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six
real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance
comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning
baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial
step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical
blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the
era of foundation models.

Conclusion: MarginSel通过增加困难示例的边界，有效改善了LLM的决策边界。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context

selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision
boundary in a beneficial direction.

Conclusion: SPT和Sequence Score技术成功捕捉蛋白质序列中的生物智能，并提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for
predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on
exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence
among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein
function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with
meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely
Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein
function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently
interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming
the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein
Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only
5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3%
on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset,
all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score
technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful
patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these
patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.

Result: SVH-MOL在多目标问题和多任务学习中表现出色。

Conclusion: SVH-MOL有效解决了Pareto解多样性与超体积优化的平衡问题。

Abstract: Pareto Set Learning (PSL) is popular as an efficient approach to obtaining
the complete optimal solution in Multi-objective Learning (MOL). A set of
optimal solutions approximates the Pareto set, and its mapping is a set of
dense points in the Pareto front in objective space. However, some current
methods face a challenge: how to make the Pareto solution is diverse while
maximizing the hypervolume value. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
address this challenge, which employs Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)
to approximate the entire Pareto set. SVGD pushes a set of particles towards
the Pareto set by applying a form of functional gradient descent, which helps
to converge and diversify optimal solutions. Additionally, we employ diverse
gradient direction strategies to thoroughly investigate a unified framework for
SVGD in multi-objective optimization and adapt this framework with an annealing
schedule to promote stability. We introduce our method, SVH-MOL, and validate
its effectiveness through extensive experiments on multi-objective problems and
multi-task learning, demonstrating its superior performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分位数的风险正则化强化学习算法，通过CVaR整合安全性约束，避免复杂架构，并在动态任务中表现优于风险中性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流近似动作值迭代RL算法在高方差随机环境中存在高估偏差，导致策略次优，且现有方法难以确保安全性约束。

Method: 提出一种风险正则化的分位数方法，整合CVaR以强制安全性，无需复杂架构，并证明其在Wasserstein空间中的收敛性。

Result: 在动态避障任务中，该方法比风险中性方法实现更多目标成功、更少碰撞和更好的安全性能权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了RL中的高估偏差和安全性约束问题，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Mainstream approximate action-value iteration reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms suffer from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal policies in
high-variance stochastic environments. Quantile-based action-value iteration
methods reduce this bias by learning a distribution of the expected cost-to-go
using quantile regression. However, ensuring that the learned policy satisfies
safety constraints remains a challenge when these constraints are not
explicitly integrated into the RL framework. Existing methods often require
complex neural architectures or manual tradeoffs due to combined cost
functions. To address this, we propose a risk-regularized quantile-based
algorithm integrating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to enforce safety
without complex architectures. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the
contraction properties of the risk-sensitive distributional Bellman operator in
Wasserstein space, ensuring convergence to a unique cost distribution.
Simulations of a mobile robot in a dynamic reach-avoid task show that our
approach leads to more goal successes, fewer collisions, and better
safety-performance trade-offs compared to risk-neutral methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过模型编辑增强低资源语言识别的方法，显著提升了跨域和跨字母表的迁移学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如古代手稿和非西方语言）在识别系统中代表性不足的问题，提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用模型编辑技术，结合领域合并策略，优化稀疏数据分布下的学习效果。

Result: 在迁移学习和跨域评估中表现优异，特别是在历史密码文本和非拉丁字母表上。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言的识别提供了一种高效解决方案，扩展了文档识别的适用范围。

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

<details>

Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练和测试域之间的分布变化下性能下降，影响应用体验。现有测试时适应方法难以应对动态、多测试分布的情况。

Method: FIND包含三个关键组件：层间特征解耦（LFD）、特征感知批量归一化（FABN）和选择性FABN（S-FABN）。LFD通过构建图结构稳定捕捉相似分布特征，FABN结合源统计和测试分布统计优化特征表示，S-FABN决定哪些层需要分区。

Result: FIND在动态场景中显著优于现有方法，准确性提升30%，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: FIND通过特征解耦和动态归一化策略，有效解决了测试时分布变化问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现代图学习中，消息传递图神经网络（MPGNNs）通常追求最大表达能力，但本文旨在通过高效的聚合机制在表达能力和聚合能力之间取得平衡。

Method: 引入了一种基于层次化毛虫图同态计数的高效聚合机制，并提出了Caterpillar GNN，能够在不同复杂度之间灵活调整。

Result: 在合成任务中，Caterpillar GNN成功解决了传统MPGNN难以处理的问题；在真实数据集上，其预测性能与传统方法相当，同时显著减少了计算图中的隐藏层节点数。

Conclusion: Caterpillar GNN通过高效的聚合机制，在保持性能的同时降低了计算复杂度，为图学习提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs) dominate modern graph
learning, typically prioritizing maximal expressive power. In contrast, we
introduce an \emph{efficient aggregation} mechanism, deliberately trading off
some expressivity for stronger and more structured aggregation capabilities.
Our approach allows seamless scaling between classical message-passing and
simpler methods based on colored or plain walks. We rigorously characterize the
expressive power at each intermediate step using homomorphism counts from a
hierarchy of generalized \emph{caterpillar graphs}. Based on this foundation,
we propose the \emph{Caterpillar GNN}, whose robust graph-level aggregation
enables it to successfully tackle synthetic graph-level task specifically
designed to be challenging for classical MPGNNs. Moreover, we demonstrate that,
on real-world datasets, the Caterpillar GNN achieves comparable predictive
performance while significantly reducing the number of nodes in the hidden
layers of the computational graph.

Conclusion: GAS通过图搜索和状态聚类，有效解决了离线分层强化学习中的子目标选择和状态转移问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on
high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their
efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective
strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different
trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that
formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an
explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance
Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from
different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition
stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal
sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the
subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)
metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly
enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across
locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most
stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at:

Conclusion: FuncGNN通过多粒度特征提取和自适应归一化，有效提升了逻辑电路表示的准确性和效率。

Abstract: As integrated circuit scale grows and design complexity rises, effective
circuit representation helps support logic synthesis, formal verification, and
other automated processes in electronic design automation. And-Inverter Graphs
(AIGs), as a compact and canonical structure, are widely adopted for
representing Boolean logic in these workflows. However, the increasing
complexity and integration density of modern circuits introduce structural
heterogeneity and global logic information loss in AIGs, posing significant
challenges to accurate circuit modeling. To address these issues, we propose
FuncGNN, which integrates hybrid feature aggregation to extract
multi-granularity topological patterns, thereby mitigating structural
heterogeneity and enhancing logic circuit representations. FuncGNN further
introduces gate-aware normalization that adapts to circuit-specific gate
distributions, improving robustness to structural heterogeneity. Finally,
FuncGNN employs multi-layer integration to merge intermediate features across
layers, effectively synthesizing local and global semantic information for
comprehensive logic representations. Experimental results on two logic-level
analysis tasks (i.e., signal probability prediction and truth-table distance
prediction) demonstrate that FuncGNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 2.06% and 18.71%, respectively, while
reducing training time by approximately 50.6% and GPU memory usage by about
32.8%.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from
expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been
successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based
methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic
complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization
problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing
two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns
rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2)
Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by
matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These
methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to
implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline
benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our
simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings
suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment
rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of
complexity in future IRL design.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IMPA-HGAE的新框架，通过充分利用元路径上的内部节点信息来增强目标节点嵌入，解决了现有异构图SSL模型信息利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异构图SSL模型通过元路径将异构图转换为同构图进行训练，仅利用元路径两端节点的信息，而忽略了元路径上的异构节点信息。

Method: 提出了IMPA-HGAE框架，利用元路径上的内部节点信息增强目标节点嵌入，并引入了创新的掩码策略以提升生成式SSL模型在异构图数据上的表征能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂图场景中利用元路径引导的结构语义进行鲁棒表示学习提供了见解，并探讨了生成式自监督学习在异构图中的未来方向。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been increasingly applied to
diverse downstream tasks due to their superior generalization capabilities and
low annotation costs. However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models
convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training,
which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while
underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE
to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information
along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves
superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper
introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational
capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally,
this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential
future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous
graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural
semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文研究了神经扩散过程在全局优化中的应用，基于Zhang等人的Path Integral Sampler，通过Boltzmann分布将优化问题转化为Schrödinger桥采样问题，并利用Girsanov定理和神经近似（Fourier MLP）求解。实验表明该方法在2至1,247维任务中表现良好，但在15.9k参数模型中探索高维空间时存在困难。

Motivation: 探索神经扩散过程在全局优化中的潜力，特别是如何通过Boltzmann分布和Schrödinger桥采样问题来优化高维任务。

Method: 将优化问题转化为Schrödinger桥采样问题，应用Girsanov定理和单点先验，通过Fourier MLP进行神经近似求解。

Result: 在2至1,247维任务中表现良好，但在15.9k参数模型中探索高维空间时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在低维任务中表现优异，但在高维环境中需要进一步改进适应性。

Abstract: We present an early investigation into the use of neural diffusion processes
for global optimisation, focusing on Zhang et al.'s Path Integral Sampler. One
can use the Boltzmann distribution to formulate optimization as solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge sampling problem, then apply Girsanov's theorem with a
simple (single-point) prior to frame it in stochastic control terms, and
compute the solution's integral terms via a neural approximation (a Fourier
MLP). We provide theoretical bounds for this optimiser, results on toy
optimisation tasks, and a summary of the stochastic theory motivating the
model. Ultimately, we found the optimiser to display promising per-step
performance at optimisation tasks between 2 and 1,247 dimensions, but struggle
to explore higher-dimensional spaces when faced with a 15.9k parameter model,
indicating a need for work on adaptation in such environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于二阶数据流形表示的CEMS方法，用于回归任务中的高效数据增强，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据增强在分类任务中表现优异，但在回归问题中应用较少。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种新的流形学习方法。

Method: 利用二阶数据流形表示，开发了Curvature-Enhanced Manifold Sampling (CEMS)方法，用于高效生成和重建数据点。

Result: CEMS在多个数据集上表现出色，优于现有方法，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: CEMS为回归任务提供了一种高效的数据增强方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models with a large number of parameters, often referred to as
over-parameterized models, have achieved exceptional performance across various
tasks. Despite concerns about overfitting, these models frequently generalize
well to unseen data, thanks to effective regularization techniques, with data
augmentation being among the most widely used. While data augmentation has
shown great success in classification tasks using label-preserving
transformations, its application in regression problems has received less
attention. Recently, a novel \emph{manifold learning} approach for generating
synthetic data was proposed, utilizing a first-order approximation of the data
manifold. Building on this foundation, we present a theoretical framework and
practical tools for approximating and sampling general data manifolds.
Furthermore, we introduce the Curvature-Enhanced Manifold Sampling (CEMS)
method for regression tasks. CEMS leverages a second-order representation of
the data manifold to enable efficient sampling and reconstruction of new data
points. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that CEMS delivers superior performance in
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while introducing only
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: FA-INR提出了一种基于交叉注意力和记忆库的隐式神经表示方法，通过自适应特征分配和混合专家机制，显著提升了复杂科学场建模的精度和模型紧凑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示（INRs）在处理具有局部高频变化的复杂科学场时表现不佳，且传统方法依赖刚性几何结构导致灵活性不足和模型体积增大。

Method: FA-INR利用交叉注意力机制和记忆库学习自适应特征表示，并引入坐标引导的混合专家（MoE）提升特征表示的专业化和效率。

Result: 在三个大规模集成仿真数据集上的实验表明，FA-INR在保持高精度的同时显著减小了模型体积。

Conclusion: FA-INR为基于INR的代理模型建立了精度与紧凑性之间的新权衡前沿。

Abstract: Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific
simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and
continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often
struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency
variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features
along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility
and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to
an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling
adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather
than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce
a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization
and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale
ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art
fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off
frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

TL;DR: 本文研究了高维设置下具有重尾响应的差分隐私稀疏线性回归问题，提出了两种方法（DP-IHT-H和DP-IHT-L），分别在不同假设下优化了误差界，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对常规数据分布或低维不规则数据，无法满足高维重尾数据的需求，因此需要研究更通用的差分隐私稀疏线性回归方法。

Method: 提出了两种方法：DP-IHT-H（基于Huber损失和私有迭代硬阈值）和DP-IHT-L（在额外响应假设下进一步优化误差界）。

Result: DP-IHT-H在(ε, δ)-DP模型下实现了误差界，DP-IHT-L进一步优化了误差界且不依赖尾部参数ζ。实验表明两种方法优于常规DP算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在高维重尾数据下表现优异，为差分隐私稀疏线性回归提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: As a fundamental problem in machine learning and differential privacy (DP),
DP linear regression has been extensively studied. However, most existing
methods focus primarily on either regular data distributions or low-dimensional
cases with irregular data. To address these limitations, this paper provides a
comprehensive study of DP sparse linear regression with heavy-tailed responses
in high-dimensional settings. In the first part, we introduce the DP-IHT-H
method, which leverages the Huber loss and private iterative hard thresholding
to achieve an estimation error bound of \(
  \tilde{O}\biggl(
  s^{* \frac{1 }{2}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log d}{n}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  +
  s^{* \frac{1 + 2\zeta}{2 + 2\zeta}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log^2 d}{n \varepsilon}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  \biggr) \) under the $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP model, where $n$ is the
sample size, $d$ is the dimensionality, $s^*$ is the sparsity of the parameter,
and $\zeta \in (0, 1]$ characterizes the tail heaviness of the data. In the
second part, we propose DP-IHT-L, which further improves the error bound under
additional assumptions on the response and achieves \(
  \tilde{O}\Bigl(\frac{(s^*)^{3/2} \log d}{n \varepsilon}\Bigr). \) Compared to
the first result, this bound is independent of the tail parameter $\zeta$.
Finally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we
demonstrate that our methods outperform standard DP algorithms designed for
``regular'' data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏化神经网络通常会导致性能下降，难以恢复原始性能。受鲁棒优化研究的启发，作者希望通过同时寻找稀疏且平坦的子网络来解决这一问题。

Method: 将剪枝问题建模为稀疏性约束的优化问题，以平坦性为目标，采用增强拉格朗日对偶方法求解，并进一步提出广义投影操作，得到SAFE及其扩展SAFE$^+$。

Result: 在图像分类和语言建模任务中，SAFE能持续生成泛化性能更好的稀疏网络，且对噪声数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAFE方法在稀疏性和性能之间取得了平衡，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable
performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original
performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust
optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are
both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a
sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an
objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and
extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in
novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive
evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal
that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization
performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In
addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for
real-world conditions.

Conclusion: LSE估计器在离线学习和评估中表现出色，提供了理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Off-policy learning and evaluation leverage logged bandit feedback datasets,
which contain context, action, propensity score, and feedback for each data
point. These scenarios face significant challenges due to high variance and
poor performance with low-quality propensity scores and heavy-tailed reward
distributions. We address these issues by introducing a novel estimator based
on the log-sum-exponential (LSE) operator, which outperforms traditional
inverse propensity score estimators. Our LSE estimator demonstrates variance
reduction and robustness under heavy-tailed conditions. For off-policy
evaluation, we derive upper bounds on the estimator's bias and variance. In the
off-policy learning scenario, we establish bounds on the regret -- the
performance gap between our LSE estimator and the optimal policy -- assuming
bounded $(1+\epsilon)$-th moment of weighted reward. Notably, we achieve a
convergence rate of $O(n^{-\epsilon/(1+ \epsilon)})$ for the regret bounds,
where $\epsilon \in [0,1]$ and $n$ is the size of logged bandit feedback
dataset. Theoretical analysis is complemented by comprehensive empirical
evaluations in both off-policy learning and evaluation scenarios, confirming
the practical advantages of our approach. The code for our estimator is
available at the following link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽然性能优越，但模型体积大导致推理延迟问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用基于GAN的对抗训练框架，每个退出点包含一个Transformer层和一个分类器，通过对抗训练使中间层特征接近最终层特征。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在保持性能的同时，推理速度提升超过1.51倍，并缓解了过度思考和中间危机现象。

Conclusion: FREE方法有效提升了VLMs的推理效率和模型鲁棒性，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size
poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a
concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies
in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging,
particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce
FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

Motivation: 针对决策预训练变换器（DPT）在奖励投毒攻击下的脆弱性，研究如何提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出AT-DPT框架，同时训练攻击者和DPT模型，攻击者通过污染环境奖励来最小化DPT的真实奖励，而DPT则从污染数据中推断最优动作。

Result: 在强盗问题和MDP设置中，AT-DPT显著优于现有基线，且对自适应攻击者也表现良好。

Conclusion: AT-DPT能有效提升DPT在奖励污染攻击下的鲁棒性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: We study the corruption-robustness of in-context reinforcement learning
(ICRL), focusing on the Decision-Pretrained Transformer (DPT, Lee et al.,
2023). To address the challenge of reward poisoning attacks targeting the DPT,
we propose a novel adversarial training framework, called Adversarially Trained
Decision-Pretrained Transformer (AT-DPT). Our method simultaneously trains an
attacker to minimize the true reward of the DPT by poisoning environment
rewards, and a DPT model to infer optimal actions from the poisoned data. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against standard bandit algorithms,
including robust baselines designed to handle reward contamination. Our results
show that the proposed method significantly outperforms these baselines in
bandit settings, under a learned attacker. We additionally evaluate AT-DPT on
an adaptive attacker, and observe similar results. Furthermore, we extend our
evaluation to the MDP setting, confirming that the robustness observed in
bandit scenarios generalizes to more complex environments.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用潜在Kronecker结构的方法，解决高斯过程在大规模数据集中的计算瓶颈，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程在大规模数据集上的计算效率受限，现有方法（如Kronecker积）常需近似或假设，且对缺失数据敏感。

Method: 通过将观测值的核矩阵表示为潜在Kronecker积的投影，结合迭代线性系统求解和路径条件，实现精确高斯过程推断。

Result: 在多达500万样本的真实数据集（如机器人、自动机器学习和气候应用）上，性能优于现有稀疏和变分高斯过程方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少计算资源需求，为大规模高斯过程推断提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge
due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the
Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their
application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In
particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel
matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be
expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any
observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which
frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this
limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the
kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker
product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise
conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational
GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including
robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为图数据不确定性估计提供了新思路，尤其在分布偏移场景下表现优越。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network
modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains
difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional
uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness
arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds
complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian
Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to
design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises
motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously
captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the
covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs
with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label
informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to
existing approaches.

Abstract: This work introduces GraPhy, a graph-based, physics-guided learning framework
for high-resolution and accurate air quality modeling in urban areas with

essential for reducing public exposure to pollutants. However, monitoring
networks are often sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions, limiting
the accuracy and resolution of air quality modeling. To address this, we
propose a physics-guided graph neural network architecture called GraPhy with
layers and edge features designed specifically for low-resolution monitoring
data. Experiments using data from California's socioeconomically disadvantaged
San Joaquin Valley show that GraPhy achieves the overall best performance
evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-square
value (R2), improving the performance by 9%-56% compared to various baseline
models. Moreover, GraPhy consistently outperforms baselines across different
spatial heterogeneity levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model

Abstract: Dealing with tabular data is challenging due to partial information, noise,

simultaneously address key aspects of tabular data such as textual information,
a variable number of columns, and unseen data without metadata besides column
names. We propose a novel architecture, \textit{basis transformers},
specifically designed to tackle these challenges while respecting inherent
invariances in tabular data, including hierarchical structure and the
representation of numeric values. We evaluate our design on a multi-task
tabular regression benchmark, achieving an improvement of 0.338 in the median
$R^2$ score and the lowest standard deviation across 34 tasks from the
OpenML-CTR23 benchmark. Furthermore, our model has five times fewer parameters
than the best-performing baseline and surpasses pretrained large language model

Conclusion: 本文提出的非对称黑盒攻击框架有效解决了查询成本不对称问题，为实际应用中的攻击方法提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

Abstract: When training deep neural networks with gradient descent, sharpness often
increases -- a phenomenon known as progressive sharpening -- before saturating
at the edge of stability. Although commonly observed in practice, the
underlying mechanisms behind progressive sharpening remain poorly understood.
In this work, we study this phenomenon using a minimalist model: a deep linear
network with a single neuron per layer. We show that this simple model
effectively captures the sharpness dynamics observed in recent empirical
studies, offering a simple testbed to better understand neural network
training. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how dataset properties, network
depth, stochasticity of optimizers, and step size affect the degree of
progressive sharpening in the minimalist model. We then empirically demonstrate
how these theoretical insights extend to practical scenarios. This study offers
a deeper understanding of sharpness dynamics in neural network training,
highlighting the interplay between depth, training data, and optimizers.

*Pengfei Hu,Xiaoxue Han,Fei Wang,Yue Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于医学本体层次结构的领域泛化框架UdonCare，用于解决临床预测中数据分布偏移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床预测中患者数据分布偏移导致模型性能下降，且传统方法因缺乏领域标签和忽视医学知识而效果不佳。

Method: 利用ICD-9-CM层次结构分组疾病，提出UdonCare框架，通过迭代修剪细粒度领域、编码领域信息，并采用Siamese推理机制分离领域信号与患者特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上，UdonCare在领域差异显著时表现优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 医学知识在提升临床领域泛化能力方面具有潜力，UdonCare为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization has become a critical challenge in clinical prediction,
where patient cohorts often exhibit shifting data distributions that degrade
model performance. Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in
real-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific
domain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially
difficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,
leading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,
we leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to
group diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent
domains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework
that iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,
and applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related
signals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher
performance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial
domain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge
for enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 论文研究了1-identification问题，提出新算法SEE，填补了非渐进分析的空白，实现了接近最优的样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中关于1-identification问题的非渐进分析尚不明确，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了新算法Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE)，并从非渐进角度进行理论分析。

Result: SEE算法在样本复杂度上实现了接近最优的上界和下界匹配，数值实验也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SEE算法在1-identification问题上表现优异，填补了非渐进分析的空白。

Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the
1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure
exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean
reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes
such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct
with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne & Koolen 2019 has established the
asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but
they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a
new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct
theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the
literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and
lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower
bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also
indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.

Result: 在GIAC和BRCA数据集上达到95%的分类准确率，验证了跨注意力和模态加权的重要性。

Conclusion: MoXGATE在多组学癌症亚型分类中表现出优越性能和生物通用性。

Abstract: Cancer subtype classification is crucial for personalized treatment and
prognostic assessment. However, effectively integrating multi-omic data remains
challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of genomic, epigenomic, and
transcriptomic features. In this work, we propose Modality-Aware
Cross-Attention MoXGATE, a novel deep-learning framework that leverages
cross-attention and learnable modality weights to enhance feature fusion across
multiple omics sources. Our approach effectively captures inter-modality
dependencies, ensuring robust and interpretable integration. Through
experiments on Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma (GIAC) and Breast Cancer (BRCA)
datasets from TCGA, we demonstrate that MoXGATE outperforms existing methods,
achieving 95\% classification accuracy. Ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of cross-attention over simple concatenation and highlight the
importance of different omics modalities. Moreover, our model generalizes well
to unseen cancer types e.g., breast cancer, underscoring its adaptability. Key
contributions include (1) a cross-attention-based multi-omic integration
framework, (2) modality-weighted fusion for enhanced interpretability, (3)
application of focal loss to mitigate data imbalance, and (4) validation across
multiple cancer subtypes. Our results indicate that MoXGATE is a promising
approach for multi-omic cancer subtype classification, offering improved
performance and biological generalizability.

Abstract: We address the problem of machine unlearning, where the goal is to remove the
influence of specific training data from a model upon request, motivated by
privacy concerns and regulatory requirements such as the "right to be
forgotten." Unfortunately, existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions or
lack formal guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel method for certified
machine unlearning, leveraging the connection between unlearning and privacy
amplification by stochastic post-processing. Our method uses noisy fine-tuning
on the retain data, i.e., data that does not need to be removed, to ensure
provable unlearning guarantees. This approach requires no assumptions about the
underlying loss function, making it broadly applicable across diverse settings.
We analyze the theoretical trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy and
demonstrate empirically that our method not only achieves formal unlearning
guarantees but also performs effectively in practice, outperforming existing
baselines. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有Hyperblocks方法虽然有效，但复杂且难以解释。论文旨在解决这一问题，使模型更易于理解且高效。

Method: 提出了一系列Hyperblock简化算法，包括冗余属性和块去除、重叠分析及创建分离单元，并引入k-NN回退机制确保数据全覆盖。

Result: 在WBC和MNIST等数据集上，模型在保持高准确性的同时显著降低了复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维大数据集提供了一种透明且高效的分类解决方案，适用于需要信任和清晰度的领域。

Abstract: Building on existing work with Hyperblocks, which classify data using minimum
and maximum bounds for each attribute, we focus on enhancing interpretability,
decreasing training time, and reducing model complexity without sacrificing
accuracy. This system allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to directly inspect
and understand the model's decision logic without requiring extensive machine
learning expertise. To reduce Hyperblock complexity while retaining
performance, we introduce a suite of algorithms for Hyperblock simplification.
These include removing redundant attributes, removing redundant blocks through
overlap analysis, and creating disjunctive units. These methods eliminate
unnecessary parameters, dramatically reducing model size without harming
classification power. We increase robustness by introducing an interpretable
fallback mechanism using k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers for points not
covered by any block, ensuring complete data coverage while preserving model
transparency. Our results demonstrate that interpretable models can scale to
high-dimensional, large-volume datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy.
On benchmark datasets such as WBC (9-D), we achieve strong predictive
performance with significantly reduced complexity. On MNIST (784-D), our method
continues to improve through tuning and simplification, showing promise as a
transparent alternative to black-box models in domains where trust, clarity,
and control are crucial.

Result: 实验表明，改进方法能提供更好的局部最优解，并降低聚类损失。

Conclusion: 改进后的K-means算法在局部最优性方面表现更优，且计算效率不受影响。

Abstract: The K-means algorithm is one of the most widely studied clustering algorithms
in machine learning. While extensive research has focused on its ability to
achieve a globally optimal solution, there still lacks a rigorous analysis of
its local optimality guarantees. In this paper, we first present conditions
under which the K-means algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution.
Based on this, we propose simple modifications to the K-means algorithm which
ensure local optimality in both the continuous and discrete sense, with the
same computational complexity as the original K-means algorithm. As the
dissimilarity measure, we consider a general Bregman divergence, which is an
extension of the squared Euclidean distance often used in the K-means
algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that the K-means algorithm does not
always find a locally optimal solution in practice, while our proposed methods
provide improved locally optimal solutions with reduced clustering loss. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lmingyi/LO-K-means.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPS欺骗导致的非法活动（如非法捕鱼和石油走私）问题，同时应对AI生成虚假轨迹和数据标注不足的挑战。

Method: 结合物理运动学约束的扩散模型，识别不符合物理规律的轨迹。

Result: 在真实数据集（海事和城市领域）上表现优于现有方法，检测精度更高，估计误差更低。

Conclusion: 物理约束的扩散模型能有效检测异常轨迹，为相关领域提供实用工具。

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our
implementation is available at

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过后处理或推理阶段满足约束，且依赖分布假设，限制了模型的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在偏微分方程学习和时间序列预测中展示了广泛适用性。

Conclusion: ProbHardE2E为硬约束和不确定性量化提供了一种通用且灵活的方法。

Abstract: We present a general purpose probabilistic forecasting framework,
ProbHardE2E, to learn systems that can incorporate operational/physical
constraints as hard requirements. ProbHardE2E enforces hard constraints by
exploiting variance information in a novel way; and thus it is also capable of
performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the model. Our methodology uses a
novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined
with a wide range of neural network architectures. This DPPL allows the model
to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where
the constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at
inference. In addition, ProbHardE2E can optimize a strictly proper scoring
rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which
enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing
approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are
heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it
can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of
modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E to problems in learning partial
differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic
time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general setup
that connects these seemingly disparate domains.

Result: 随机森林方法在实验中表现最佳，准确率达到88%，验证了其高性能和可复现性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非标准化开发的疲劳检测方法的问题，并展示了一种高性能且实现得当的方法。

Abstract: Driver drowsiness detection (DDD) prevents road accidents caused by driver
fatigue. Vehicle dynamics-based DDD has been proposed as a method that is both
economical and high performance. However, there are concerns about the
reliability of performance metrics and the reproducibility of many of the
existing methods. For instance, some previous studies seem to have a data
leakage issue among training and test datasets, and many do not openly provide
the datasets they used. To this end, this paper aims to compare the performance
of representative vehicle dynamics-based DDD methods under a transparent and
fair framework that uses a public dataset. We first develop a framework for
extracting features from an open dataset by Aygun et al. and performing DDD
with lightweight ML models; the framework is carefully designed to support a
variety of onfigurations. Second, we implement three existing representative
methods and a concise random forest (RF)-based method in the framework.
Finally, we report the results of experiments to verify the reproducibility and
clarify the performance of DDD based on common metrics. Among the evaluated
methods, the RF-based method achieved the highest accuracy of 88 %. Our
findings imply the issues inherent in DDD methods developed in a non-standard
manner, and demonstrate a high performance method implemented appropriately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在现实应用中的部署增多，确保其能够拒绝恶意提示（如越狱攻击）至关重要，但现有方法在安全性和实用性之间存在权衡问题。

Method: AlphaSteer将激活引导视为可学习过程，通过两个目标（实用性保留和安全性增强）优化引导向量，利用零空间约束和线性回归。

Result: 实验表明，AlphaSteer显著提升了LLMs的安全性，同时未损害其通用能力。

Conclusion: AlphaSteer是一种理论支持且实证有效的方法，解决了安全性与实用性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their
ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential
for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an
effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction
vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further
induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying
activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and
utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and
degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector
calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this
trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and
effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we
present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering
method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a
learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation
and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a
nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.
For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for
steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across
multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without
compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at

Motivation: 表格数据在现实应用中广泛存在，但回归任务中的数据不平衡问题研究不足，现有方法依赖已知且平衡的测试分布假设，导致性能下降。

Method: MATI采用高斯混合模型捕捉相关区域，训练区域特定专家，并通过测试时自监督动态调整专家权重以适应不同测试分布。

Result: 在四种真实数据集上，MATI在三种测试分布下平均MAE提升7.1%。

Conclusion: MATI有效解决了表格不平衡回归问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Tabular data serve as a fundamental and ubiquitous representation of
structured information in numerous real-world applications, e.g., finance and
urban planning. In the realm of tabular imbalanced applications, data imbalance
has been investigated in classification tasks with insufficient instances in
certain labels, causing the model's ineffective generalizability. However, the
imbalance issue of tabular regression tasks is underexplored, and yet is
critical due to unclear boundaries for continuous labels and simplifying
assumptions in existing imbalance regression work, which often rely on known
and balanced test distributions. Such assumptions may not hold in practice and
can lead to performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose MATI:
Mixture Experts with Test-Time Self-Supervised Aggregation for Tabular
Imbalance Regression, featuring two key innovations: (i) the Region-Aware
Mixture Expert, which adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model to capture the underlying
related regions. The statistical information of each Gaussian component is then
used to synthesize and train region-specific experts to capture the unique
characteristics of their respective regions. (ii) Test-Time Self-Supervised
Expert Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts region expert weights based on
test data features to reinforce expert adaptation across varying test
distributions. We evaluated MATI on four real-world tabular imbalance
regression datasets, including house pricing, bike sharing, and age prediction.
To reflect realistic deployment scenarios, we adopted three types of test
distributions: a balanced distribution with uniform target frequencies, a
normal distribution that follows the training data, and an inverse distribution
that emphasizes rare target regions. On average across these three test
distributions, MATI achieved a 7.1% improvement in MAE compared to existing
methods.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present the first $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust
average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with non-asymptotic convergence
under contamination, TV distance and Wasserstein distance uncertainty sets. We
show that the robust $Q$ Bellman operator is a strict contractive mapping with
respect to a carefully constructed semi-norm with constant functions being
quotiented out. This property supports a stochastic approximation update, that
learns the optimal robust $Q$ function in $\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples.
We also show that the same idea can be used for robust $Q$ function estimation,
which can be further used for critic estimation. Coupling it with theories in
robust policy mirror descent update, we present a natural actor-critic
algorithm that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy in
$\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-3})$ samples. These results advance the theory of
distributionally robust reinforcement learning in the average reward setting.

Result: FairPFN在多样化的手工和真实场景中表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FairPFN为复杂公平问题提供了更易用的因果公平解决方案，推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are utilized in critical sectors, such as
healthcare, law enforcement, and finance. However, these systems are often
trained on historical data that contains demographic biases, leading to ML
decisions that perpetuate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. Causal
fairness provides a transparent, human-in-the-loop framework to mitigate
algorithmic discrimination, aligning closely with legal doctrines of direct and
indirect discrimination. However, current causal fairness frameworks hold a key
limitation in that they assume prior knowledge of the correct causal model,
restricting their applicability in complex fairness scenarios where causal
models are unknown or difficult to identify. To bridge this gap, we propose
FairPFN, a tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic causal fairness
data to identify and mitigate the causal effects of protected attributes in its
predictions. FairPFN's key contribution is that it requires no knowledge of the
causal model and still demonstrates strong performance in identifying and
removing protected causal effects across a diverse set of hand-crafted and
real-world scenarios relative to robust baseline methods. FairPFN paves the way
for promising future research, making causal fairness more accessible to a
wider variety of complex fairness problems.

Conclusion: PGTS通过树搜索机制显著提升了策略优化的效果，尤其在复杂环境中表现突出。

Abstract: Classical policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently
converge to suboptimal local optima, a challenge exacerbated in large or
complex environments. This work investigates Policy Gradient with Tree Search
(PGTS), an approach that integrates an $m$-step lookahead mechanism to enhance
policy optimization. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that
increasing the tree search depth $m$-monotonically reduces the set of
undesirable stationary points and, consequently, improves the worst-case
performance of any resulting stationary policy. Critically, our analysis
accommodates practical scenarios where policy updates are restricted to states
visited by the current policy, rather than requiring updates across the entire
state space. Empirical evaluations on diverse MDP structures, including Ladder,
Tightrope, and Gridworld environments, illustrate PGTS's ability to exhibit
"farsightedness," navigate challenging reward landscapes, escape local traps
where standard PG fails, and achieve superior solutions.

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究了状态熵正则化在奖励和转移不确定性下的鲁棒性，并与策略熵正则化进行对比。

Result: 状态熵正则化对结构化扰动具有更强的鲁棒性，但其优势对策略评估的采样次数更敏感。

Conclusion: 状态熵正则化在特定场景下优于策略熵正则化，但实际应用中需注意采样效率的影响。

Abstract: State entropy regularization has empirically shown better exploration and
sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL). However, its theoretical
guarantees have not been studied. In this paper, we show that state entropy
regularization improves robustness to structured and spatially correlated
perturbations. These types of variation are common in transfer learning but
often overlooked by standard robust RL methods, which typically focus on small,
uncorrelated changes. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these
robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition
uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our
analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy
regularization, highlighting their different benefits. Finally, from a
practical standpoint, we illustrate that compared with policy entropy, the
robustness advantages of state entropy are more sensitive to the number of
rollouts used for policy evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在高概率非渐近情况下，针对固定设计的ℓ²正则化非线性最小二乘问题的置信度估计方法，特别关注局部最小化器的置信区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于为非线性最小二乘问题的预测提供点式置信区间，并确保其随测试数据与训练数据的相似性动态调整。

Method: 方法基于隐式特征空间中测试数据与训练数据的相似性，通过加权范数（涉及目标函数的逆Hessian矩阵）构建置信区间。

Result: 结果表明，所提置信区间在覆盖率和宽度上优于传统的自助法，且计算效率接近梯度计算成本。

Conclusion: 结论指出，该方法为非渐近情况下MLE估计的经典置信区间提供了有效替代，适用于非线性预测器如神经网络。

Abstract: We consider a high-probability non-asymptotic confidence estimation in the
$\ell^2$-regularized non-linear least-squares setting with fixed design. In
particular, we study confidence estimation for local minimizers of the
regularized training loss. We show a pointwise confidence bound, meaning that
it holds for the prediction on any given fixed test input $x$. Importantly, the
proposed confidence bound scales with similarity of the test input to the
training data in the implicit feature space of the predictor (for instance,
becoming very large when the test input lies far outside of the training data).
This desirable last feature is captured by the weighted norm involving the
inverse-Hessian matrix of the objective function, which is a generalized
version of its counterpart in the linear setting, $x^{\top} \text{Cov}^{-1} x$.
Our generalized result can be regarded as a non-asymptotic counterpart of the
classical confidence interval based on asymptotic normality of the MLE
estimator. We propose an efficient method for computing the weighted norm,
which only mildly exceeds the cost of a gradient computation of the loss
function. Finally, we complement our analysis with empirical evidence showing
that the proposed confidence bound provides better coverage/width trade-off
compared to a confidence estimation by bootstrapping, which is a gold-standard
method in many applications involving non-linear predictors such as neural
networks.

### [326] [Patient Similarity Computation for Clinical Decision Support: An Efficient Use of Data Transformation, Combining Static and Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07092)
*Joydeb Kumar Sana,Mohammad M. Masud,M Sohel Rahman,M Saifur Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数据转换的分布式患者相似性计算（DPSC）技术，结合时间序列和静态数据，显著提升了预测性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者相似性计算（PSC）是医疗信息学中的核心问题，旨在通过患者历史临床记录衡量相似性，以支持临床决策。

Method: 采用数据转换方法（aWOE和Z-score）处理静态数据，并结合动态时间规整（DTW）进行时间序列相似性计算，同时通过分布式计算优化DTW的运行时间。

Result: 在冠状动脉疾病和充血性心力衰竭的预测中，AUC、准确率和F值分别提升高达11.4%、10.20%、12.6%和15.9%、10.5%、21.9%，计算时间减少40%。

Conclusion: 提出的DPSC方法在预测性能和计算效率上均表现出显著优势，为医疗决策提供了更高效的支持。

Abstract: Patient similarity computation (PSC) is a fundamental problem in healthcare
informatics. The aim of the patient similarity computation is to measure the
similarity among patients according to their historical clinical records, which
helps to improve clinical decision support. This paper presents a novel
distributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique based on data
transformation (DT) methods, utilizing an effective combination of time series
and static data. Time series data are sensor-collected patients' information,
including metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, Oxygen saturation,
respiration, etc. The static data are mainly patient background and demographic
data, including age, weight, height, gender, etc. Static data has been used for
clustering the patients. Before feeding the static data to the machine learning
model adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score data transformation (DT)
methods have been performed, which improve the prediction performances. In
aWOE-based patient similarity models, sensitive patient information has been
processed using aWOE which preserves the data privacy of the trained models. We
used the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach, which is robust and very popular,
for time series similarity. However, DTW is not suitable for big data due to
the significant computational run-time. To overcome this problem, distributed
DTW computation is used in this study. For Coronary Artery Disease, our DT
based approach boosts prediction performance by as much as 11.4%, 10.20%, and
12.6% in terms of AUC, accuracy, and F-measure, respectively. In the case of
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), our proposed method achieves performance
enhancement up to 15.9%, 10.5%, and 21.9% for the same measures, respectively.
The proposed method reduces the computation time by as high as 40%.

TL;DR: CoFILL是一种基于条件扩散模型的新型时空数据填补方法，通过双流架构并行处理时空特征，显著提升了填补精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习和深度学习方法在时空数据填补中存在累积误差和难以建模时空依赖的问题。

Method: 提出CoFILL，利用扩散模型生成高质量填补值，结合双流架构并行处理时空和频域特征。

Result: 实验表明CoFILL在填补精度上优于现有方法，并能有效捕捉数据中的快速波动和潜在模式。

Conclusion: CoFILL为时空数据填补提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Missing data in spatiotemporal systems presents a significant challenge for
modern applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban traffic
management. The integrity of spatiotemporal data often deteriorates due to
hardware malfunctions and software failures in real-world deployments. Current
approaches based on machine learning and deep learning struggle to model the
intricate interdependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions effectively
and, more importantly, suffer from cumulative errors during the data imputation
process, which propagate and amplify through iterations. To address these
limitations, we propose CoFILL, a novel Conditional Diffusion Model for
spatiotemporal data imputation. CoFILL builds on the inherent advantages of
diffusion models to generate high-quality imputations without relying on
potentially error-prone prior estimates. It incorporates an innovative
dual-stream architecture that processes temporal and frequency domain features
in parallel. By fusing these complementary features, CoFILL captures both rapid
fluctuations and underlying patterns in the data, which enables more robust
imputation. The extensive experiments reveal that CoFILL's noise prediction
network successfully transforms random noise into meaningful values that align
with the true data distribution. The results also show that CoFILL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy. The source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/joyHJL/CoFILL.

*Eshwar S. R.,Gugan Thoppe,Aditya Gopalan,Gal Dalal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI)算法，解决了传统强化学习中函数逼近下策略迭代单调性失效的问题，并提供了理论保证和实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在函数逼近下策略迭代的单调性保证失效，导致算法性能不稳定。

Method: RPI通过基于Bellman的约束优化替代传统策略评估中的投影或Bellman误差最小化，确保单调性和收敛性。

Result: RPI在经典控制任务中保持下界保证，性能优于或匹配基线方法。

Conclusion: RPI是首个在函数逼近下具有单调性和收敛性保证的算法，适用于主流模型无关强化学习方法。

Abstract: Despite decades of research, it remains challenging to correctly use
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with function approximation. A prime
example is policy iteration, whose fundamental guarantee of monotonic
improvement collapses even under linear function approximation. To address this
issue, we introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI). It replaces the common
projection or Bellman-error minimization during policy evaluation with a
Bellman-based constrained optimization. We prove that not only does RPI confer
textbook monotonicity on its value estimates but these estimates also lower
bound the true return. Also, their limit partially satisfies the unprojected
Bellman equation, emphasizing RPI's natural fit within RL. RPI is the first
algorithm with such monotonicity and convergence guarantees under function
approximation. For practical use, we provide a model-free variant of RPI that
amounts to a novel critic. It can be readily integrated into primary model-free
PI implementations such as DQN and DDPG. In classical control tasks, such
RPI-enhanced variants consistently maintain their lower-bound guarantee while
matching or surpassing the performance of all baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多目标偏好对齐方法无法有效平衡不同偏好维度，且依赖辅助模型增加计算复杂度。

Method: 引入多目标优化范式，利用维度感知生成指标作为隐式奖励，通过自适应权重分配机制动态调整偏好优先级。

Result: AMoPO在7B、14B和32B模型上表现优异，优于基线方法28.5%，验证了其适应性和扩展性。

Conclusion: AMoPO能够实现维度感知的偏好对齐，展现出显著优势，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Existing multi-objective preference alignment methods for large language
models (LLMs) face limitations: (1) the inability to effectively balance
various preference dimensions, and (2) reliance on auxiliary reward/reference
models introduces computational complexity. To address these challenges, we
propose Adaptive Multi-objective Preference Optimization (AMoPO), a novel
framework that achieves dynamic balance across preference dimensions. By
introducing the multi-objective optimization paradigm to use the
dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, AMoPO aligns LLMs with
diverse preferences without additional reward models or reference models. We
introduce an adaptive weight assignment mechanism that models the generation
space as a Gaussian distribution, allowing dynamic prioritization of preference
dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate that AMoPO outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, and the experiments on 7B, 14B, and 32B
models reveal the scaling ability of AMoPO. Moreover, additional analysis of
multiple dimensions verifies its adaptability and effectiveness. These findings
validate AMoPO's capability to achieve dimension-aware preference alignment,
highlighting its superiority. Our codes and datasets are available at

Motivation: 传统GNN在TAG中因复杂文本信息表现不佳，现有方法需要大量标注或微调，耗时且昂贵。

Method: GAGA通过标注代表性节点和边构建标注图，并采用两级对齐模块整合标注图与TAG。

Result: 实验表明，GAGA仅需1%的标注数据即可达到或超越现有方法分类精度。

Conclusion: GAGA是一种高效且经济的TAG表示学习解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,
demonstrating its high efficiency.

Result: 在四个大规模真实交通数据集上，RAGL在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAGL模型在交通预测任务中表现出色，解决了嵌入正则化和可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical task in spatial-temporal forecasting with
broad applications in travel planning and urban management. Adaptive graph
convolution networks have emerged as mainstream solutions due to their ability
to learn node embeddings in a data-driven manner and capture complex latent
dependencies. However, existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic
forecasting often either ignore the regularization of node embeddings, which
account for a significant proportion of model parameters, or face scalability
issues from expensive graph convolution operations. To address these
challenges, we propose a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning (RAGL) model.
First, we introduce a regularized adaptive graph learning framework that
synergizes Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution via
a residual difference mechanism, achieving both embedding regularization and
noise suppression. Second, to ensure scalability on large road networks, we
develop the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO), which performs graph convolution
based on the cosine similarity of regularized embeddings with linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world traffic
datasets show that RAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络依赖反向传播调整权重，缺乏可解释性和适应性。Neurovectors旨在通过向量关系和信息结构化解决这些问题。

Method: 利用Neurovectors在向量空间中编码数据，通过能量传播而非权重更新驱动学习，生成动态知识表示。

Result: 在UCI和Kaggle数据集上的实验表明，Neurovectors在分类和回归任务中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Neurovectors提供了一种更适应性强且可解释的学习方法，性能与传统模型相当。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel learning approach based on Neurovectors, an
innovative paradigm that structures information through interconnected nodes
and vector relationships for tabular data processing. Unlike traditional
artificial neural networks that rely on weight adjustment through
backpropagation, Neurovectors encode information by structuring data in vector
spaces where energy propagation, rather than traditional weight updates, drives
the learning process, enabling a more adaptable and explainable learning
process. Our method generates dynamic representations of knowledge through
neurovectors, thereby improving both the interpretability and efficiency of the
predictive model. Experimental results using datasets from well-established
repositories such as the UCI machine learning repository and Kaggle are
reported both for classification and regression. To evaluate its performance,
we compare our approach with standard machine learning and deep learning
models, showing that Neurovectors achieve competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: 双曲几何为复杂、结构化、层次化数据的生成建模提供了强大基础。

Abstract: Generating graphs with hierarchical structures remains a fundamental
challenge due to the limitations of Euclidean geometry in capturing exponential
complexity. Here we introduce \textbf{GGBall}, a novel hyperbolic framework for
graph generation that integrates geometric inductive biases with modern
generative paradigms. GGBall combines a Hyperbolic Vector-Quantized Autoencoder
(HVQVAE) with a Riemannian flow matching prior defined via closed-form
geodesics. This design enables flow-based priors to model complex latent
distributions, while vector quantization helps preserve the curvature-aware
structure of the hyperbolic space. We further develop a suite of hyperbolic GNN
and Transformer layers that operate entirely within the manifold, ensuring
stability and scalability. Empirically, our model reduces degree MMD by over
75\% on Community-Small and over 40\% on Ego-Small compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating an improved ability to preserve topological
hierarchies. These results highlight the potential of hyperbolic geometry as a
powerful foundation for the generative modeling of complex, structured, and
hierarchical data domains. Our code is available at

Result: 在多个多模态推理基准测试中，Perception-R1仅用1,442训练数据即达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Perception-R1有效提升了MLLMs的多模态感知与推理能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

Conclusion: 通过调节推理长度，可以显著优化LLMs的表现，同时公开代码以供进一步研究。

Abstract: Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated
strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's
internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing
answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the
reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the
task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to
unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and
exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the
length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show
that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an
interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights
on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress
encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more
concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that
this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy,
and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

connects the distributional population loss with the approximate posterior,
motivating a practical dual optimization procedure that enforces distributional
robustness while fostering particle diversity. We evaluate IBDR's performance
against various baseline methods using the VTAB-1K benchmark and the common

Conclusion: SPlus方法显著提升了优化效率和稳定性，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network
optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and
alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we
find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached
for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a
historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in
across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements.
Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across
network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large
parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks
faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed
Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language
modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different
stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation
performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock
time.

Abstract: Modern data marketplaces and data sharing consortia increasingly rely on
incentive mechanisms to encourage agents to contribute data. However, schemes
that reward agents based on the quantity of submitted data are vulnerable to
manipulation, as agents may submit fabricated or low-quality data to inflate
their rewards. Prior work has proposed comparing each agent's data against
others' to promote honesty: when others contribute genuine data, the best way
to minimize discrepancy is to do the same. Yet prior implementations of this
idea rely on very strong assumptions about the data distribution (e.g.
Gaussian), limiting their applicability. In this work, we develop reward
mechanisms based on a novel, two-sample test inspired by the Cram\'er-von Mises
statistic. Our methods strictly incentivize agents to submit more genuine data,
while disincentivizing data fabrication and other types of untruthful
reporting. We establish that truthful reporting constitutes a (possibly
approximate) Nash equilibrium in both Bayesian and prior-agnostic settings. We
theoretically instantiate our method in three canonical data sharing problems
and show that it relaxes key assumptions made by prior work. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our mechanism incentivizes truthful data sharing via
simulations and on real-world language and image data.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the tokenized linear bandit (TLB) and multi-armed bandit (TMAB),
variants of linear and stochastic multi-armed bandit problems inspired by LLM
decoding and alignment. In these problems, at each round $t \in [T]$, a user
submits a query (context), and the decision maker (DM) sequentially selects a
token irrevocably from a token set. Once the sequence is complete, the DM
observes a random utility from the user, whose expectation is presented by a
sequence function mapping the chosen token sequence to a nonnegative real value
that depends on the query.
  In both problems, we first show that learning is impossible without any
structure on the sequence function. We introduce a natural assumption,
diminishing distance with more commons (DDMC), and propose algorithms with
regret $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T^{2/3}})$ for TLB and
TMAB, respectively. As a side product, we obtain an (almost) optimality of the
greedy decoding for LLM decoding algorithm under DDMC, which justifies the
unresaonable effectiveness of greedy decoding in several tasks. This also has
an immediate application to decoding-time LLM alignment, when the misaligned
utility can be represented as the frozen LLM's utility and a linearly
realizable latent function. We finally validate our algorithm's performance
empirically as well as verify our assumptions using synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Conclusion: EVINET为开放世界图学习提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often
studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known
a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment,
it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong
prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification
detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes,
i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning
Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by
integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes
two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and
Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple
metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification
detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity
of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection
and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph
learning. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/SSSKJ/EviNET.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational tools for modeling sequential

designed by human experts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that ICL can learn and predict HMM-generated sequences$\unicode{x2013}$an

Result: 在多种数据集（如面部图像、活动传感器信号和语音记录）上验证了PASS的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: PASS在保护隐私属性的同时保持了数据实用性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The growing Machine Learning (ML) services require extensive collections of
user data, which may inadvertently include people's private information
irrelevant to the services. Various studies have been proposed to protect
private attributes by removing them from the data while maintaining the
utilities of the data for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, as we theoretically
and empirically show in the paper, these methods reveal severe vulnerability
because of a common weakness rooted in their adversarial training based
strategies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach, PASS,
designed to stochastically substitute the original sample with another one
according to certain probabilities, which is trained with a novel loss function
soundly derived from information-theoretic objective defined for
utility-preserving private attributes protection. The comprehensive evaluation
of PASS on various datasets of different modalities, including facial images,
human activity sensory signals, and voice recording datasets, substantiates
PASS's effectiveness and generalizability.

Result: 在NVIDIA L4 GPU上的测试显示，推理延迟显著降低，且随序列长度线性增长。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来长上下文模型的部署提供了高效解决方案，并已开源实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during
long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches.
In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's
FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated
with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model
Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data.
Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced
inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to
2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency
increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged
for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged
attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence
lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We
open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future
long-context model deployment.

Abstract: Many security and network applications require having large datasets to train
the machine learning models. Limited data access is a well-known problem in the
security domain. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer models
to enlarge the size of data by synthesizing new samples, but the synthesized
samples don't improve the models over the real data. To address this issue, we
design an efficient transformer-based model as a generative framework to
generate time-series data, that can be used to boost the performance of
existing and new ML workflows. Our new transformer model achieves the SOTA
results. We style our model to be generalizable and work across different
datasets, and produce high-quality samples.

Result: 在ERA5再分析数据集上验证，DEF方法提升了预测性能并生成合理的分布估计，减少了长期预测误差。

Conclusion: DEF方法为机器学习天气预测提供了一种有效的随机扰动生成方式，显著提升了预测性能和实用性。

Abstract: We present DEF (\textbf{\ul{D}}iffusion-augmented \textbf{\ul{E}}nsemble
\textbf{\ul{F}}orecasting), a novel approach for generating initial condition
perturbations. Modern approaches to initial condition perturbations are
primarily designed for numerical weather prediction (NWP) solvers, limiting
their applicability in the rapidly growing field of machine learning for
weather prediction. Consequently, stochastic models in this domain are often
developed on a case-by-case basis. We demonstrate that a simple conditional
diffusion model can (1) generate meaningful structured perturbations, (2) be
applied iteratively, and (3) utilize a guidance term to intuitivey control the
level of perturbation. This method enables the transformation of any
deterministic neural forecasting system into a stochastic one. With our
stochastic extended systems, we show that the model accumulates less error over
long-term forecasts while producing meaningful forecast distributions. We
validate our approach on the 5.625$^\circ$ ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which
comprises atmospheric and surface variables over a discretized global grid,
spanning from the 1960s to the present. On this dataset, our method
demonstrates improved predictive performance along with reasonable spread

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备移动性导致间歇性连接，影响AFL的收敛性，需要研究稀疏化、模型陈旧性和移动性接触模式的相互作用。

Method: 开发理论模型分析稀疏化、模型陈旧性和移动性接触模式对AFL收敛的影响，并提出MADS算法动态优化稀疏化程度。

Result: 实验表明，MADS在CIFAR-10数据集上提高分类准确率8.76%，在Argoverse轨迹预测数据集上减少平均位移误差9.46%。

Conclusion: MADS算法通过动态调整稀疏化程度，有效提升了AFL在移动设备上的性能。

Abstract: Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) enables distributed model training
across multiple mobile devices, allowing each device to independently update
its local model without waiting for others. However, device mobility introduces
intermittent connectivity, which necessitates gradient sparsification and leads
to model staleness, jointly affecting AFL convergence. This paper develops a
theoretical model to characterize the interplay among sparsification, model
staleness and mobility-induced contact patterns, and their joint impact on AFL
convergence. Based on the analysis, we propose a mobility-aware dynamic
sparsification (MADS) algorithm that optimizes the sparsification degree based
on contact time and model staleness. Closed-form solutions are derived, showing
that under low-speed conditions, MADS increases the sparsification degree to
enhance convergence, while under high-speed conditions, it reduces the
sparsification degree to guarantee reliable uploads within limited contact
time. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings. Compared with the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, the MADS algorithm increases the image
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by 8.76% and reduces the
average displacement error in the Argoverse trajectory prediction dataset by
9.46%.

Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，恶意交互检测成为关键需求，需要高效且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 系统探索了五种基于Transformer的架构，包括基础分类器、增强注意力池化、混合神经网络集成和多任务框架。

Result: 在九种对抗性数据集上测试，Raudra表现最稳健，但各架构在速度、可解释性和资源需求上有不同权衡。

Conclusion: JavelinGuard提供了多种架构选择，帮助实践者在复杂性和效率之间找到最佳平衡，适用于实际LLM安全应用。

Abstract: We present JavelinGuard, a suite of low-cost, high-performance model
architectures designed for detecting malicious intent in Large Language Model
(LLM) interactions, optimized specifically for production deployment. Recent
advances in transformer architectures, including compact BERT(Devlin et al.
2019) variants (e.g., ModernBERT (Warner et al. 2024)), allow us to build
highly accurate classifiers with as few as approximately 400M parameters that
achieve rapid inference speeds even on standard CPU hardware. We systematically
explore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures:
Sharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced
attention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid
neural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework
with specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across
nine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject
series, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly
introduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on
challenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our
architectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large
decoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance
trade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while
Raudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each
architecture presents unique trade-offs in speed, interpretability, and
resource requirements, guiding practitioners in selecting the optimal balance
of complexity and efficiency for real-world LLM security applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph-KV通过利用KV缓存和结构归纳偏置，改进了大型语言模型在处理结构化数据时的性能，显著优于传统序列化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型（LLM）在处理结构化数据时，由于输入被序列化为扁平序列，无法充分利用结构依赖关系，限制了其在检索增强生成（RAG）和图结构数据推理等任务中的表现。

Method: Graph-KV利用KV缓存作为文本段的压缩表示，并通过结构归纳偏置控制它们的交互。目标段仅选择性关注其指定的源段KV缓存，而非序列中的所有前驱段，从而引入图结构块掩码和消息传递机制。此外，通过策略性分配位置编码，减少位置偏见和上下文窗口消耗。

Result: Graph-KV在三个场景（RAG基准测试、Arxiv-QA和论文主题分类）中显著优于基线方法，有效减少了位置偏见并利用了结构归纳偏置。

Conclusion: Graph-KV通过结合KV缓存和结构归纳偏置，提升了LLM在处理结构化数据时的性能，为相关任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are inherently auto-regressive, requiring
input to be serialized into flat sequences regardless of their structural
dependencies. This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage
structural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where
inter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the
potential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text
segments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through
structural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively
attend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than
all preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a
graph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a
message-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated
positional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and
context window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1)
seven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and
long-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with
full-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper
topic classification within a citation network. By effectively reducing
positional bias and harnessing structural inductive biases, Graph-KV
substantially outperforms baselines, including standard costly sequential
encoding, across various settings. Code and the Graph-KV data are publicly
available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在封闭环境中，传统适应方法因无法访问模型参数或架构而不可行，SALT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入紧凑的可训练适配器，优化头部网络的潜在特征，支持用户特定适应，同时不增加通信开销。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证了更高的准确率和更低的训练延迟，适用于边缘AI系统。

Conclusion: SALT为严格系统约束下的个性化推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model
adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the
head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such
closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they
require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this
challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to
refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation
without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We
evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared
to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for
robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud
environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical
solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system
constraints.

Motivation: 多GPU MoE网络中专家分布不均导致负载不平衡，现有方法通过动态复制热门专家来平衡负载，但需预测路由前的分布。

Method: 提出MoE-GPS框架，量化预测策略对系统性能的影响，推荐仅预测总体令牌分布的Distribution-Only Prediction策略。

Result: 在Mixtral 8x7B MMLU数据集上，Distribution-Only Prediction比传统Token-to-Expert Prediction提升推理性能23%以上。

Conclusion: MoE-GPS为多GPU MoE网络提供高效预测策略选择，显著优化系统性能。

Abstract: In multi-GPU Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network, experts are distributed across
different GPUs, which creates load imbalance as each expert processes different
number of tokens. Recent works improve MoE inference load balance by
dynamically duplicating popular experts to more GPUs to process excessive
tokens, which requires predicting the distribution before routing. In this
paper, we discuss the tradeoff of prediction strategies, accuracies, overhead,
and end-to-end system performance. We propose MoE-GPS, a framework that guides
the selection of the optimal predictor design under various system
configurations, by quantifying the performance impact to system-level model
runtime. Specifically, we advocate for Distribution-Only Prediction, a
prediction strategy that only predicts overall token distribution which
significantly reduces overhead compared to the traditional Token-to-Expert
Prediction. On Mixtral 8x7B MMLU dataset, MoE-GPS suggests Distribution-Only
Prediction which improves end-to-end inference performance by more than 23%
compared with Token-to-Expert Prediction.

Conclusion: 矩对齐为域泛化提供了统一的理论视角，CMA算法高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks to develop models that generalize well to
unseen target domains, addressing the prevalent issue of distribution shifts in
real-world applications. One line of research in DG focuses on aligning
domain-level gradients and Hessians to enhance generalization. However,
existing methods are computationally inefficient and the underlying principles
of these approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we develop the
theory of moment alignment for DG. Grounded in \textit{transfer measure}, a
principled framework for quantifying generalizability between two domains, we
first extend the definition of transfer measure to domain generalization that
includes multiple source domains and establish a target error bound. Then, we
prove that aligning derivatives across domains improves transfer measure both
when the feature extractor induces an invariant optimal predictor across
domains and when it does not. Notably, moment alignment provides a unifying
understanding of Invariant Risk Minimization, gradient matching, and Hessian
matching, three previously disconnected approaches to DG. We further connect
feature moments and derivatives of the classifier head, and establish the
duality between feature learning and classifier fitting. Building upon our
theory, we introduce \textbf{C}losed-Form \textbf{M}oment \textbf{A}lignment
(CMA), a novel DG algorithm that aligns domain-level gradients and Hessians in
closed-form. Our method overcomes the computational inefficiencies of existing
gradient and Hessian-based techniques by eliminating the need for repeated
backpropagation or sampling-based Hessian estimation. We validate the efficacy
of our approach through two sets of experiments: linear probing and full
fine-tuning. CMA demonstrates superior performance in both settings compared to
Empirical Risk Minimization and state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: 该框架为Transformer提供了新的几何视角，并在性能上取得改进，未来将在视觉和大语言模型上进一步验证。

Abstract: This research endeavors to offer insights into unlocking the further
potential of transformer-based architectures. One of the primary motivations is
to offer a geometric interpretation for the attention mechanism in
transformers. In our framework, the attention mainly involves metric tensors,
tangent spaces, inner product, and how they relate to each other. These
quantities and structures at discrete positions are intricately interconnected
via the parallel transport of tangent vectors. To make the learning process
more efficient, we reduce the number of parameters through ingenious predefined
configurations. Moreover, we introduce an explicit mechanism to highlight a
neighborhood by attenuating the remote values, given that transformers
inherently neglect local inductive bias. Experimental results demonstrate that
our modules deliver significant performance improvements relative to the
baseline. More evaluation experiments on visual and large language models will
be launched successively.

Result: InverseScope显著提升了样本效率，支持对大型语言模型内部表示的系统化和定量分析。

Conclusion: InverseScope为解释大型语言模型的内部表示提供了一种高效、可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is
a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature
interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure
of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce
InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting
neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a
distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this
distribution to infer the encoded features. To address the inefficiency of
sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation
architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous
methods. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests
interpretability hypotheses using feature consistency rate computed over the
sampled inputs. InverseScope scales inversion-based interpretability methods to
larger models and practical tasks, enabling systematic and quantitative
analysis of internal representations in real-world LLMs.

anomaly detection and improve the real-time response efficiency. By introducing
the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, the model dynamically adapts
to different cloud service providers and environments, so as to more
effectively detect abnormal patterns and predict potential failures.
Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than
the traditional anomaly detection system in terms of detection accuracy and
latency, and significantly improves the resilience and active management
ability of cloud infrastructure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分数阶雅可比矩阵的矩阵微分方法（${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$），用于实现分数阶自动微分技术，提升深度学习中的分数阶微分实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏与自动微分技术完美兼容的分数阶矩阵微分方法，限制了分数阶微分在神经网络优化中的应用。

Method: 通过整数阶雅可比矩阵定义引入分数阶雅可比矩阵微分（${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$），设计分数阶自动微分技术，并在PyTorch框架中实现分数阶线性模块（FLinear）。

Result: 实验验证了${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$在训练集、验证集和测试集上的优越性能，以及其在时间和GPU内存消耗上的高效性。

Conclusion: ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$是一种优秀的分数阶梯度下降方法，适用于深度学习领域。

Abstract: Fractional-order differentiation has many characteristics different from
integer-order differentiation. These characteristics can be applied to the
optimization algorithms of artificial neural networks to obtain better results.
However, due to insufficient theoretical research, at present, there is no
fractional-order matrix differentiation method that is perfectly compatible
with automatic differentiation (Autograd) technology. Therefore, we propose a
fractional-order matrix differentiation calculation method. This method is
introduced by the definition of the integer-order Jacobian matrix. We denote it
as fractional-order Jacobian matrix differentiation (${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$).
Through ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$, we can carry out the matrix-based
fractional-order chain rule. Based on the Linear module and the
fractional-order differentiation, we design the fractional-order Autograd
technology to enable the use of fractional-order differentiation in hidden
layers, thereby enhancing the practicality of fractional-order differentiation
in deep learning. In the experiment, according to the PyTorch framework, we
design fractional-order Linear (FLinear) and replace nn.Linear in the
multilayer perceptron with FLinear. Through the qualitative analysis of the
training set and validation set $Loss$, the quantitative analysis of the test
set indicators, and the analysis of time consumption and GPU memory usage
during model training, we verify the superior performance of ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha
}$ and prove that it is an excellent fractional-order gradient descent method
in the field of deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VarCon提出了一种变分监督对比学习方法，通过变分推断优化类感知匹配，解决了传统对比学习中的分布调控和泛化问题，并在多个数据集上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习存在嵌入分布调控不足和泛化能力受限的问题，VarCon旨在通过变分推断优化类感知匹配和嵌入空间控制。

Method: VarCon将监督对比学习重新表述为对潜在类变量的变分推断，最大化后验加权的ELBO，取代了耗尽的成对比较。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K上，VarCon实现了79.36%的Top-1准确率，收敛仅需200轮，且表现出更清晰的决策边界和语义组织。

Conclusion: VarCon在性能、泛化能力和鲁棒性上均优于传统方法，为对比学习提供了更高效的框架。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

Result: 在NVIDIA DRIVE Thor平台上，流水线实现2.5倍端到端延迟降低，FP8量化后提升至3.2倍，且不影响任务准确性。

Conclusion: 该流水线是资源受限环境中实时部署VLM的可行解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline
specifically optimized for deployment on embedded devices, such as those used
in robotics and autonomous driving. The pipeline significantly reduces the
computational overhead by jointly leveraging patch selection to filter
irrelevant camera views, a token selection module to reduce input sequence
length for the LLM, and speculative decoding to accelerate token generation.
Evaluation on the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform for automonous driving
application, our pipeline achieves $2.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction
without compromising task accuracy. The speed-up further increases to
$3.2\times$ when applying FP8 post-training quantization. These results
demonstrate our pipeline as a viable solution for enabling real-time VLM
deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出EviSEC方法，通过证据深度学习和频谱感知对比学习解决动态图中OOD检测的高偏差、高方差和分数同质化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中的OOD检测在安全敏感领域备受关注，但现有方法主要针对静态图，存在高偏差、高方差和分数同质化问题。

Method: 提出EviSEC方法，结合证据神经网络和频谱感知增强模块，通过后验Dirichlet分布解释输入随机性，并生成OOD近似样本以扩大ID与OOD分数差距。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，EviSEC能有效检测动态图中的OOD样本。

Conclusion: EviSEC通过结合证据深度学习和频谱感知对比学习，显著提升了动态图中OOD检测的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims
to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the
in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in
security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on
static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high
variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions
sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from
the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific
patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID
and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in
dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).
Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via
Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural
network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,
explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,
which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware
augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high
OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and
mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Fed-ICL的框架，通过多轮客户端与服务器交互提升问答任务中的上下文学习效果，避免了模型参数传输的高通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据隐私、标注成本和分布差异，高质量上下文学习示例稀缺，现有方法要么通信开销大，要么未能充分利用本地数据。

Method: 提出Fed-ICL框架，通过客户端与服务器的多轮交互逐步优化回答，无需传输模型参数。

Result: 理论证明了Fed-ICL的收敛性，实验表明其在标准问答基准上表现优异且通信成本低。

Conclusion: Fed-ICL是一种高效且低通信开销的上下文学习增强方法。

Abstract: For question-answering (QA) tasks, in-context learning (ICL) enables language
models to generate responses without modifying their parameters by leveraging
examples provided in the input. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily
depends on the availability of high-quality examples, which are often scarce
due to data privacy constraints, annotation costs, and distribution
disparities. A natural solution is to utilize examples stored on client
devices, but existing approaches either require transmitting model parameters -
incurring significant communication overhead - or fail to fully exploit local
datasets, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose
Federated In-Context Learning (Fed-ICL), a general framework that enhances ICL
through an iterative, collaborative process. Fed-ICL progressively refines
responses by leveraging multi-round interactions between clients and a central
server, improving answer quality without the need to transmit model parameters.
We establish theoretical guarantees for the convergence of Fed-ICL and conduct
extensive experiments on standard QA benchmarks, demonstrating that our
proposed approach achieves strong performance while maintaining low
communication costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出采用贝叶斯实验建模框架，以主动管理和解决LLM部署中的不确定性，而非被动避免。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM部署中缺乏系统区分和应对不确定性的工具，导致保守策略（如拒绝高不确定性输出）限制了可靠性。

Method: 引入贝叶斯实验建模框架，为不确定性提供一致的理论基础，并支持主动解决措施（如请求澄清或检索外部信息）。

Result: 该框架使LLM及其用户能采取情境适当的步骤，提升系统的可靠性和透明度。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯框架为高风险的现实场景提供了更可靠、广泛适用的LLM系统解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are highly interactive and extendable,
current approaches to ensure reliability in deployments remain mostly limited
to rejecting outputs with high uncertainty in order to avoid misinformation.
This conservative strategy reflects the current lack of tools to systematically
distinguish and respond to different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we
advocate for the adoption of Bayesian Modeling of Experiments -- a framework
that provides a coherent foundation to reason about uncertainty and clarify the
reducibility of uncertainty -- for managing and proactively addressing
uncertainty that arises in LLM deployments. This framework enables LLMs and
their users to take contextually appropriate steps, such as requesting
clarification, retrieving external information, or refining inputs. By
supporting active resolution rather than passive avoidance, it opens the door
to more reliable, transparent, and broadly applicable LLM systems, particularly
in high-stakes, real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，特定风格提示（如列表格式）会提高大型语言模型（LLM）对越狱攻击的脆弱性，攻击成功率（ASR）显著增加。作者提出SafeStyle防御策略，通过风格匹配的安全训练数据提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究风格提示对LLM安全性的影响，以及如何通过风格对齐缓解越狱攻击风险。

Method: 评估32个LLM在7个越狱基准测试中的表现，分析风格模式长度与注意力机制的关系，并提出SafeStyle防御策略。

Result: 风格提示显著增加ASR，且风格对齐会加剧模型脆弱性；SafeStyle在多种风格设置下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 风格提示对LLM安全性有负面影响，SafeStyle能有效提升模型抗攻击能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质生成模型因高质量数据集稀缺而成功率受限，需要一种可扩展且自动化的改进方法。

Method: 采用在线强化学习框架，结合高效代理奖励模型（ESM-fold和快速ddG预测器）和多目标优化策略（包括多样性正则化）。

Result: ProteinZero在结构准确性、可设计性、热力学稳定性和序列多样性上均优于现有方法，设计失败率降低36%-48%，成功率超过90%。

Conclusion: ProteinZero为蛋白质设计提供了持续自我改进的新范式，为探索蛋白质设计空间开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Protein generative models have shown remarkable promise in protein design but
still face limitations in success rate, due to the scarcity of high-quality
protein datasets for supervised pretraining. We present ProteinZero, a novel
framework that enables scalable, automated, and continuous self-improvement of
the inverse folding model through online reinforcement learning. To achieve
computationally tractable online feedback, we introduce efficient proxy reward
models based on ESM-fold and a novel rapid ddG predictor that significantly
accelerates evaluation speed. ProteinZero employs a general RL framework
balancing multi-reward maximization, KL-divergence from a reference model, and
a novel protein-embedding level diversity regularization that prevents mode
collapse while promoting higher sequence diversity. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ProteinZero substantially outperforms existing
methods across every key metric in protein design, achieving significant
improvements in structural accuracy, designability, thermodynamic stability,
and sequence diversity. Most impressively, ProteinZero reduces design failure
rates by approximately 36% - 48% compared to widely-used methods like
ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF and InstructPLM, consistently achieving success rates
exceeding 90% across diverse and complex protein folds. Notably, the entire RL
run on CATH-4.3 can be done with a single 8 X GPU node in under 3 days,
including reward computation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein
design where models evolve continuously from their own generated outputs,
opening new possibilities for exploring the vast protein design space.

Motivation: 现有后门防御方法通常需要标记数据或特定训练流程，限制了其在监督学习之外的适用性，而TSC旨在填补这一空白。

Method: TSC利用神经网络的排列不变性和二次模式连接性，通过两阶段对称连接性放大中毒样本的损失，同时保持干净的准确率。

Result: 实验表明，TSC在监督学习场景中性能与现有最优方法相当，并能推广到自监督学习框架（如SimCLR和CLIP）。

Conclusion: TSC是一种通用且高效的后门净化防御方法，适用于多种学习范式。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious
behaviors are implanted during training. While existing defenses can
effectively purify compromised models, they typically require labeled data or
specific training procedures, making them difficult to apply beyond supervised
learning settings. Notably, recent studies have shown successful backdoor
attacks across various learning paradigms, highlighting a critical security
concern. To address this gap, we propose Two-stage Symmetry Connectivity (TSC),
a novel backdoor purification defense that operates independently of data
format and requires only a small fraction of clean samples. Through theoretical
analysis, we prove that by leveraging permutation invariance in neural networks
and quadratic mode connectivity, TSC amplifies the loss on poisoned samples
while maintaining bounded clean accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that TSC
achieves robust performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in
supervised learning scenarios. Furthermore, TSC generalizes to self-supervised
learning frameworks, such as SimCLR and CLIP, maintaining its strong defense
capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiePeng104/TSC.

Motivation: 尽管神经网络在自动推理中取得进展，但将其整合到实际验证工作流中仍具挑战性。Lean作为流行的证明助手，缺乏类似工具。

Result: 评估显示，LeanHammer比现有前提选择器多解决21%的目标，并能泛化到多样领域。

Conclusion: LeanHammer填补了神经检索与符号推理间的空白，使形式验证更易用。

Abstract: Neural methods are transforming automated reasoning for proof assistants, yet
integrating these advances into practical verification workflows remains
challenging. Hammers are tools that interface with external automatic theorem
provers to automate tedious reasoning steps. They have dramatically improved
productivity in proof assistants, but the Lean proof assistant still does not
have a hammer despite its growing popularity. We present LeanHammer, the first
end-to-end domain-general hammer for Lean, built on a novel neural premise
selection system for a hammer in dependent type theory. Unlike existing Lean
premise selectors, our approach dynamically adapts to user-specific contexts
and combines with symbolic proof search and reconstruction to create a
practical hammer. With comprehensive evaluations, we show that our premise
selector enables LeanHammer to solve 21\% more goals relative to existing
premise selectors, and generalize well to diverse domains. Our work bridges the
gap between neural retrieval and symbolic reasoning, making formal verification
more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF依赖复杂的训练序列，而DPO及其变体虽简化了流程，但仍存在正则化和插值问题，因此需要更优的替代方案。

Method: 通过引入显式偏好优化框架EXPO，避免DPO的隐式奖励重参数化，提出直观的正则化因子。

Result: EXPO在理论上满足正则化需求，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: EXPO提供了一种更透明、更优的替代方案，解决了DPO的局限性。

Abstract: The generated responses of large language models (LLMs) are often fine-tuned
to human preferences through a process called reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). As RLHF relies on a challenging training sequence, whereby a
separate reward model is independently learned and then later applied to LLM
policy updates, ongoing research effort has targeted more straightforward
alternatives. In this regard, direct preference optimization (DPO) and its many
offshoots circumvent the need for a separate reward training step. Instead,
through the judicious use of a reparameterization trick that induces an
\textit{implicit} reward, DPO and related methods consolidate learning to the
minimization of a single loss function. And yet despite demonstrable success in
some real-world settings, we prove that DPO-based objectives are nonetheless
subject to sub-optimal regularization and counter-intuitive interpolation
behaviors, underappreciated artifacts of the reparameterizations upon which
they are based. To this end, we introduce an \textit{explicit} preference
optimization framework termed EXPO that requires no analogous
reparameterization to achieve an implicit reward. Quite differently, we merely
posit intuitively-appealing regularization factors from scratch that
transparently avoid the potential pitfalls of key DPO variants, provably
satisfying regularization desiderata that prior methods do not. Empirical
results serve to corroborate our analyses and showcase the efficacy of EXPO.

Result: 训练速度提升4.5倍，离散化差距减少98%，未使用门数量减少100%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升LGNs的训练效率和实际部署性能。

Abstract: Modern neural networks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on numerous
existing benchmarks; however, their high computational requirements and energy
consumption prompt researchers to seek more efficient solutions for real-world
deployment. Logic gate networks (LGNs) learns a large network of logic gates
for efficient image classification. However, learning a network that can solve
a simple problem like CIFAR-10 can take days to weeks to train. Even then,
almost half of the network remains unused, causing a discretization gap. This
discretization gap hinders real-world deployment of LGNs, as the performance
drop between training and inference negatively impacts accuracy. We inject
Gumbel noise with a straight-through estimator during training to significantly
speed up training, improve neuron utilization, and decrease the discretization
gap. We theoretically show that this results from implicit Hessian
regularization, which improves the convergence properties of LGNs. We train
networks $4.5 \times$ faster in wall-clock time, reduce the discretization gap
by $98\%$, and reduce the number of unused gates by $100\%$.

Motivation: 解决CoM中子链仅依赖前序信息导致的长距离依赖丢失问题。

Method: 将隐式令牌表示映射为可微分稀疏因果邻接矩阵，结合因果掩码注意力和因果-MoE，通过干预一致性损失和自演化门实现动态平衡。

Result: GoCE提升了Transformer捕捉长距离因果依赖的能力，并在多个数据集上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: GoCE不仅优于CoM设计，还为因果学习和持续自适应改进提供了经验。

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

Motivation: 研究如何在强化学习中高效利用先验数据（如演示），避免模仿学习目标对长期性能的负面影响。

Result: 在七个模拟连续控制任务中，性能比现有方法提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: DGN通过探索导向的方式利用先验数据，避免了模仿学习的局限性，显著提升了强化学习效果。

Abstract: We study the problem of sample efficient reinforcement learning, where prior
data such as demonstrations are provided for initialization in lieu of a dense
reward signal. A natural approach is to incorporate an imitation learning
objective, either as regularization during training or to acquire a reference
policy. However, imitation learning objectives can ultimately degrade long-term
performance, as it does not directly align with reward maximization. In this
work, we propose to use prior data solely for guiding exploration via noise
added to the policy, sidestepping the need for explicit behavior cloning
constraints. The key insight in our framework, Data-Guided Noise (DGN), is that
demonstrations are most useful for identifying which actions should be
explored, rather than forcing the policy to take certain actions. Our approach
achieves up to 2-3x improvement over prior reinforcement learning from offline
data methods across seven simulated continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: 释放外生变量独立性假设，提出新算法显著提升推荐系统的准确性和公平性。

Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) aim to provide personalized content, but they
face a challenge in unbiased learning due to selection bias, where users only
interact with items they prefer. This bias leads to a distorted representation
of user preferences, which hinders the accuracy and fairness of
recommendations. To address the issue, various methods such as error imputation
based, inverse propensity scoring, and doubly robust techniques have been
developed. Despite the progress, from the structural causal model perspective,
previous debiasing methods in RS assume the independence of the exogenous
variables. In this paper, we release this assumption and propose a learning
algorithm based on likelihood maximization to learn a prediction model. We
first discuss the correlation and difference between unmeasured confounding and
our scenario, then we propose a unified method that effectively handles latent
exogenous variables. Specifically, our method models the data generation
process with latent exogenous variables under mild normality assumptions. We
then develop a Monte Carlo algorithm to numerically estimate the likelihood
function. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and three real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is at

### [372] [Flowing Datasets with Wasserstein over Wasserstein Gradient Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07534)
*Clément Bonet,Christophe Vauthier,Anna Korba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于最优传输的Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW)距离，用于处理概率分布上的梯度流，并应用于迁移学习和数据集蒸馏任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中许多应用涉及概率分布数据，需要设计新的梯度流技术来处理这类无限维对象。

Method: 将每个类别表示为特征的条件分布，数据集建模为这些类别的混合分布，引入WoW距离和梯度流。

Result: 提出了WoW梯度流框架，并在迁移学习和数据集蒸馏任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: WoW梯度流为处理概率分布数据提供了新方法，并在实际应用中展示了潜力。

Abstract: Many applications in machine learning involve data represented as probability
distributions. The emergence of such data requires radically novel techniques
to design tractable gradient flows on probability distributions over this type
of (infinite-dimensional) objects. For instance, being able to flow labeled
datasets is a core task for applications ranging from domain adaptation to
transfer learning or dataset distillation. In this setting, we propose to
represent each class by the associated conditional distribution of features,
and to model the dataset as a mixture distribution supported on these classes
(which are themselves probability distributions), meaning that labeled datasets
can be seen as probability distributions over probability distributions. We
endow this space with a metric structure from optimal transport, namely the
Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance, derive a differential structure on
this space, and define WoW gradient flows. The latter enables to design
dynamics over this space that decrease a given objective functional. We apply
our framework to transfer learning and dataset distillation tasks, leveraging
our gradient flow construction as well as novel tractable functionals that take
the form of Maximum Mean Discrepancies with Sliced-Wasserstein based kernels
between probability distributions.

*Zhangchi Zhao,Jun Shu,Deyu Meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaKANs提出了一种通过元学习生成KANs权重的方法，显著减少了可训练参数数量，同时保持性能与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs作为函数逼近的新框架，虽高效且可解释，但参数过多导致内存和训练成本高。MetaKANs旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过较小的元学习器（MetaKANs）生成KANs的权重，并以端到端可微分的方式联合训练，减少参数数量。

Result: 在符号回归、偏微分方程求解和图像分类等任务中，MetaKANs在参数效率和内存使用上表现优异。

Conclusion: MetaKANs为KANs提供了一种更高效且可扩展的训练方法，缩小了与MLPs的训练成本差距。

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs offer a novel
framework for function approximation by replacing traditional neural network
weights with learnable univariate functions. This design demonstrates
significant potential as an efficient and interpretable alternative to
traditional MLPs. However, KANs are characterized by a substantially larger
number of trainable parameters, leading to challenges in memory efficiency and
higher training costs compared to MLPs. To address this limitation, we propose
to generate weights for KANs via a smaller meta-learner, called MetaKANs. By
training KANs and MetaKANs in an end-to-end differentiable manner, MetaKANs
achieve comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters and maintaining promising interpretability.
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark tasks, including symbolic
regression, partial differential equation solving, and image classification,
demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaKANs in improving parameter efficiency and
memory usage. The proposed method provides an alternative technique for
training KANs, that allows for greater scalability and extensibility, and
narrows the training cost gap with MLPs stated in the original paper of KANs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising
capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated
pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical
expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that
synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from
basic information retrieval to complex reaction predictions, and a dataset
curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both
effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and
evaluation. We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search
(HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and
execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level
fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM
that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks,
offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for
advanced chemical applications. All datasets and code are available at

*Florian Andreas Marwitz,Ralf Möller,Magnus Bender,Marcel Gehrke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过仅使用最可能的状态（top-p）来加速动态概率模型推理的方法，同时证明了误差受限于p和模型的最小混合率，实验显示速度提升显著且误差较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态概率模型推理复杂度高且计算效率低，尤其是隐马尔可夫模型中需要枚举整个状态空间，导致不必要的计算和噪声传播。

Method: 提出仅使用累积概率为p的最可能状态（top-p）来简化推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可实现至少一个数量级的速度提升，且总变差距离误差低于0.09。

Conclusion: 通过限制状态空间为top-p状态，显著提高了推理效率，同时误差可控。

Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving
expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state
space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible
probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and
increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose
to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states,
i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the
error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called
minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical
evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of
magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种联邦学习（FL）优化方法FedCGD，通过多级梯度发散（CGD）分析，平衡设备级和样本级的梯度差异，提升收敛速度和分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线网络中，联邦学习面临数据异构性和带宽限制问题，现有研究多关注设备个体差异，而忽略了设备组和样本级的集体梯度发散对收敛速度的影响。

Method: 论文证明了FL收敛速度受设备级和样本级CGD总和影响，并将设备级CGD转化为加权地动距离（WEMD），提出FedCGD算法在多项式时间内优化多级CGD。

Result: 实验表明，FedCGD在CIFAR-10数据集上分类精度提升4.2%，同时减少41.8%的设备调度，并能灵活调整WEMD和采样方差的优化。

Conclusion: FedCGD通过多级梯度发散优化，显著提升了联邦学习的性能和效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for multiple devices to
cooperatively train a model. When applied in wireless networks, two issues
consistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices
and limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling
strategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data
heterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that
the convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and
sample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers
to the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of
the individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper
bounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total
number of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the
device-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it
into the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution
and the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the
sum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within
polynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\% while scheduling
41.8\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing
sampling variance.

TL;DR: MIRA是一个专为医疗时间序列设计的统一基础模型，通过创新方法解决了医疗数据的不规则性、异质采样率和缺失值问题，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗时间序列数据具有不规则间隔、异质采样率和频繁缺失值等挑战，现有通用基础模型难以处理。MIRA旨在解决这些问题，减少标注负担，支持跨机构和任务的稳健迁移。

Method: MIRA采用连续时间旋转位置编码、频率特定专家混合层和基于神经ODE的连续动态外推块，以建模不规则时间间隔和连续状态轨迹。

Result: 在大规模医疗数据上预训练后，MIRA在分布外和分布内场景中分别平均减少10%和7%的预测误差。

Conclusion: MIRA为医疗时间序列建模提供了统一基础，并通过综合基准为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open
access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to
reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust
transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in
data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist
time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due
to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous
sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical
time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional
Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a
frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across
latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a
Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the
continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at
arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical
corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available
datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10%
and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when
compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a
comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks,
establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 飞机轨迹建模对空中交通管理至关重要，但现有数据集往往不足或不平衡，需通过数据增强提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，ATRADA能生成高质量的合成轨迹数据，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: ATRADA为飞机轨迹数据增强提供了一种有效解决方案，有助于提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management
(ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict
detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the
addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a
more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is
sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called
ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework,
a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory
dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned
latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into
reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data
points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from
the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original
dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several
experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new,
high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the
results of several baselines.

Motivation: PEFT方法虽高效，但设计空间庞大，传统搜索方法开销大。

Method: 将PEFT策略搜索视为剪枝问题，采用混合剪枝策略迭代移除冗余模块。

Result: 显著减少计算负担，优化配置。

Conclusion: PrunePEFT是一种高效、可扩展的PEFT策略搜索方法。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as effective and
promising approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. Compared with
Full parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT), PEFT achieved comparable task performance
with a substantial reduction of trainable parameters, which largely saved the
training and storage costs. However, using the PEFT method requires considering
a vast design space, such as the type of PEFT modules and their insertion
layers. Inadequate configurations can lead to sub-optimal results. Conventional
solutions such as architectural search techniques, while effective, tend to
introduce substantial additional overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, PrunePEFT, which formulates the PEFT strategy search as a pruning
problem and introduces a hybrid pruning strategy that capitalizes on the
sensitivity of pruning methods to different PEFT modules. This method extends
traditional pruning techniques by iteratively removing redundant or conflicting
PEFT modules, thereby optimizing the fine-tuned configuration. By efficiently
identifying the most relevant modules, our approach significantly reduces the
computational burden typically associated with architectural search processes,
making it a more scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large
pre-trained models.

Motivation: 现有方法在强凸损失下遗憾界为$d_{\max} \ln T$，可能不如延迟版本的在线梯度下降的$\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}$。论文旨在填补这一差距。

Method: 提出了一种改进的跟随正则化领导者算法，适应性地调整学习率，并扩展了在线牛顿步算法以处理延迟。

Result: 实现了遗憾界$\min\{\sigma_{\max}\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$和$\min\{d_{\max} n\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的算法在理论和实验上均优于现有方法，填补了遗憾界的差距。

Abstract: In this work, we study the online convex optimization problem with curved
losses and delayed feedback. When losses are strongly convex, existing
approaches obtain regret bounds of order $d_{\max} \ln T$, where $d_{\max}$ is
the maximum delay and $T$ is the time horizon. However, in many cases, this
guarantee can be much worse than $\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}$ as obtained by a
delayed version of online gradient descent, where $d_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the
total delay. We bridge this gap by proposing a variant of
follow-the-regularized-leader that obtains regret of order
$\min\{\sigma_{\max}\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$, where $\sigma_{\max}$ is
the maximum number of missing observations. We then consider exp-concave losses
and extend the Online Newton Step algorithm to handle delays with an adaptive
learning rate tuning, achieving regret $\min\{d_{\max} n\ln T,
\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$ where $n$ is the dimension. To our knowledge, this
is the first algorithm to achieve such a regret bound for exp-concave losses.
We further consider the problem of unconstrained online linear regression and
achieve a similar guarantee by designing a variant of the Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth
forecaster with a clipping trick. Finally, we implement our algorithms and
conduct experiments under various types of delay and losses, showing an
improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Machine learning is advancing rapidly, with applications bringing notable
benefits, such as improvements in translation and code generation. Models like
ChatGPT, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly integrated
into daily life. However, alongside these benefits, LLMs also introduce social
risks. Malicious users can exploit LLMs by submitting harmful prompts, such as
requesting instructions for illegal activities. To mitigate this, models often
include a security mechanism that automatically rejects such harmful prompts.
However, they can be bypassed through LLM jailbreaks. Current jailbreaks often
require significant manual effort, high computational costs, or result in
excessive model modifications that may degrade regular utility.
  We introduce TwinBreak, an innovative safety alignment removal method.
Building on the idea that the safety mechanism operates like an embedded
backdoor, TwinBreak identifies and prunes parameters responsible for this
functionality. By focusing on the most relevant model layers, TwinBreak
performs fine-grained analysis of parameters essential to model utility and
safety. TwinBreak is the first method to analyze intermediate outputs from
prompts with high structural and content similarity to isolate safety
parameters. We present the TwinPrompt dataset containing 100 such twin prompts.
Experiments confirm TwinBreak's effectiveness, achieving 89% to 98% success
rates with minimal computational requirements across 16 LLMs from five vendors.

Abstract: Air pollution has emerged as a major public health challenge in megacities.
Numerical simulations and single-site machine learning approaches have been
widely applied in air quality forecasting tasks. However, these methods face
multiple limitations, including high computational costs, low operational
efficiency, and limited integration with observational data. With the rapid
advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to develop a
low-cost, efficient air quality forecasting model for smart urban management.
An air quality forecasting model, named FuXi-Air, has been constructed in this
study based on multimodal data fusion to support high-precision air quality
forecasting and operated in typical megacities. The model integrates
meteorological forecasts, emission inventories, and pollutant monitoring data
under the guidance of air pollution mechanism. By combining an autoregressive
prediction framework with a frame interpolation strategy, the model
successfully completes 72-hour forecasts for six major air pollutants at an
hourly resolution across multiple monitoring sites within 25-30 seconds. In
terms of both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy, it outperforms
the mainstream numerical air quality models in operational forecasting work.
Ablation experiments concerning key influencing factors show that although
meteorological data contribute more to model accuracy than emission inventories
do, the integration of multimodal data significantly improves forecasting
precision and ensures that reliable predictions are obtained under differing
pollution mechanisms across megacities. This study provides both a technical
reference and a practical example for applying multimodal data-driven models to
air quality forecasting and offers new insights into building hybrid
forecasting systems to support air pollution risk warning in smart city
management.

Abstract: Machine learning has promised to change the landscape of laboratory
chemistry, with impressive results in molecular property prediction and
reaction retro-synthesis. However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to
the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough
understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever
transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200
process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our
experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process
conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on
solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically
and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking
for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering,
and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement
and sustainable manufacturing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPNNs和Graph Transformers在捕捉长距离依赖关系时存在局限性，而ChebNet虽然早期被忽视，但其在长距离建模中具有潜力。

Method: 通过将ChebNet建模为稳定的动态系统（Stable-ChebNet），解决了多项式扩展导致的训练不稳定问题。

Result: Stable-ChebNet在长距离基准测试中表现优异，且无需复杂的图结构调整或特征分解。

Conclusion: Stable-ChebNet是一种高效且稳定的方法，适用于长距离节点交互建模。

Abstract: ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by
Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their
simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their
success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies
between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make
use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that
characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically
disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original
introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant
node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive
advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while
maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we
uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime
during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and
non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our
Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has
controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions,
positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks,
Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 发现泛化能力取决于接近真实数据生成过程的假设权重，而非假设类规模，解释了过参数化模型避免过拟合的原因。

Conclusion: 理论框架与随机梯度下降实践结合，提供了对现代AI系统泛化行为的统一理解。

Abstract: A fundamental question in modern machine learning is why large,
over-parameterized models, such as deep neural networks and transformers, tend
to generalize well, even when their number of parameters far exceeds the number
of training samples.
  We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of information theory,
grounded in universal learning theory. Specifically, we study a Bayesian
mixture learner with log-loss and (almost) uniform prior over an expansive
hypothesis class.
  Our key result shows that the learner's regret is not determined by the
overall size of the hypothesis class, but rather by the cumulative probability
of all models that are close, in Kullback-Leibler divergence distance, to the
true data-generating process. We refer to this cumulative probability as the
weight of the hypothesis.
  This leads to a natural notion of model simplicity: simple models are those
with large weight and thus require fewer samples to generalize, while complex
models have small weight and need more data. This perspective provides a
rigorous and intuitive explanation for why over-parameterized models often
avoid overfitting: the presence of simple hypotheses allows the posterior to
concentrate on them when supported by the data.
  We further bridge theory and practice by recalling that stochastic gradient
descent with Langevin dynamics samples from the correct posterior distribution,
enabling our theoretical learner to be approximated using standard machine
learning methods combined with ensemble learning.
  Our analysis yields non-uniform regret bounds and aligns with key practical
concepts such as flat minima and model distillation. The results apply broadly
across online, batch, and supervised learning settings, offering a unified and
principled understanding of the generalization behavior of modern AI systems.

Abstract: Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has emerged as an effective method
to enhance the robustness of lightweight deep neural networks against
adversarial attacks. Current ARD approaches have leveraged a large robust
teacher network to train one robust lightweight student. However, due to the
diverse range of edge devices and resource constraints, current approaches
require training a new student network from scratch to meet specific
constraints, leading to substantial computational costs and increased CO2
emissions. This paper proposes Progressive Adversarial Robustness Distillation
(ProARD), enabling the efficient one-time training of a dynamic network that
supports a diverse range of accurate and robust student networks without
requiring retraining. We first make a dynamic deep neural network based on
dynamic layers by encompassing variations in width, depth, and expansion in
each design stage to support a wide range of architectures. Then, we consider
the student network with the largest size as the dynamic teacher network.
ProARD trains this dynamic network using a weight-sharing mechanism to jointly
optimize the dynamic teacher network and its internal student networks.
However, due to the high computational cost of calculating exact gradients for
all the students within the dynamic network, a sampling mechanism is required
to select a subset of students. We show that random student sampling in each
iteration fails to produce accurate and robust students.

### [387] [How Benchmark Prediction from Fewer Data Misses the Mark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07673)
*Guanhua Zhang,Florian E. Dorner,Moritz Hardt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了11种基准预测方法在19个不同基准上的表现，发现随机采样加回归模型优于多数现有方法，且现有方法依赖模型相似性。提出了一种新方法，在模型相似性条件下表现更好，但在前沿评估中仍有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）评估成本高，需通过缩小基准数据集加速评估。

Method: 系统评估11种基准预测方法，提出随机采样加回归模型作为基线，并引入新方法（基于增强逆倾向加权）。

Result: 现有方法依赖模型相似性，新方法在模型相似性条件下优于随机采样平均，但在前沿评估中效果有限。

Conclusion: 基准预测在评估前沿（新模型能力未知时）效果不佳，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) evaluation is increasingly costly, prompting
interest in methods that speed up evaluation by shrinking benchmark datasets.
Benchmark prediction (also called efficient LLM evaluation) aims to select a
small subset of evaluation points and predict overall benchmark performance
from that subset. In this paper, we systematically assess the strengths and
limitations of 11 benchmark prediction methods across 19 diverse benchmarks.
First, we identify a highly competitive baseline: Take a random sample and fit
a regression model on the sample to predict missing entries. Outperforming most
existing methods, this baseline challenges the assumption that careful subset
selection is necessary for benchmark prediction. Second, we discover that all
existing methods crucially depend on model similarity. They work best when
interpolating scores among similar models. The effectiveness of benchmark
prediction sharply declines when new models have higher accuracy than
previously seen models. In this setting of extrapolation, none of the previous
methods consistently beat a simple average over random samples. To improve over
the sample average, we introduce a new method inspired by augmented inverse
propensity weighting. This method consistently outperforms the random sample
average even for extrapolation. However, its performance still relies on model
similarity and the gains are modest in general. This shows that benchmark
prediction fails just when it is most needed: at the evaluation frontier, where
the goal is to evaluate new models of unknown capabilities.

Result: 改进了Stable Diffusion 3和XL模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了LDMs的鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks, including image generation and video synthesis. However, they
generally lack robustness, a limitation that remains not fully explored in
current research. In this paper, we propose several methods to address this
gap. First, we hypothesize that the robustness of LDMs primarily should be
measured without their text encoder, because if we take and explore the whole
architecture, the problems of image generator and text encoders wll be fused.
Second, we introduce novel data augmentation techniques designed to reveal
robustness shortcomings in LDMs when processing diverse textual prompts. We
then fine-tune Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion XL models using
Dreambooth, incorporating these proposed augmentation methods across multiple
tasks. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation pipeline specifically tailored to
assess the robustness of LDMs fine-tuned via Dreambooth.

Result: 在NNLQP基准上超越现有方法，实现跨硬件延迟预测，并在NAS-Bench数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: LeDG-Former通过创新框架解决了关键问题，为神经网络表示学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models
into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a
crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the
cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和实用性上显著优于现有技术，适用于广泛的文本数据集和评估参数。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在分布式数据环境中广泛应用，但易受非独立同分布（non-IID）数据影响。

Method: 使用嵌入空间中数据分布的EMD进行一次性聚类。

Result: 在16种基线方法和多个挑战性数据集上表现出优越的聚类性能。

Conclusion: EMD-CFL是一种有效解决FL中非IID数据问题的方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used framework for machine learning in
distributed data environments where clients hold data that cannot be easily
centralised, such as for data protection reasons. FL, however, is known to be
vulnerable to non-IID data. Clustered FL addresses this issue by finding more
homogeneous clusters of clients. We propose a novel one-shot clustering method,
EMD-CFL, using the Earth Mover's distance (EMD) between data distributions in
embedding space. We theoretically motivate the use of EMDs using results from
the domain adaptation literature and demonstrate empirically superior
clustering performance in extensive comparisons against 16 baselines and on a
range of challenging datasets.

Motivation: 在深度学习模型应用于高风险领域时，对抗攻击的防御和不确定性估计变得至关重要。传统方法仅依赖准确性不足以保证模型的可靠性。

Method: 开发了OPSA攻击方法，通过最大化模型不确定性来降低Conformal Prediction的效率；提出了OPSA-AT防御策略，将OPSA融入新的Conformal训练范式。

Result: OPSA攻击比基线方法更能增加模型不确定性；OPSA-AT防御模型显著提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性，并保持了可靠的预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为安全关键领域开发可信赖且鲁棒的深度学习模型提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in high-risk applications,
robust defenses against adversarial attacks and reliable performance guarantees
become paramount. Moreover, accuracy alone does not provide sufficient
assurance or reliable uncertainty estimates for these models. This study
advances adversarial training by leveraging principles from Conformal
Prediction. Specifically, we develop an adversarial attack method, termed OPSA
(OPtimal Size Attack), designed to reduce the efficiency of conformal
prediction at any significance level by maximizing model uncertainty without
requiring coverage guarantees. Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT
(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel
conformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA
attack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for
various defenses. Conversely, our OPSA-AT defensive model significantly
enhances robustness not only against OPSA but also other adversarial attacks,
and maintains reliable prediction. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
this integrated approach for developing trustworthy and resilient deep learning
models for safety-critical domains. Our code is available at

Abstract: Modular object-centric representations are essential for *human-like

approach resolves spatial ambiguities, provides theoretical guarantees for
identifiability, and requires *no viewpoint annotations*. Extensive experiments
on standard benchmarks and novel complex datasets validate our method's
robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making
tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While the
consistency model offers a potential solution, its applications to
decision-making often struggle with suboptimal demonstrations or rely on
complex concurrent training of multiple networks. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning
that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process.
Our method enables single-step generation while maintaining higher performance
and simpler training. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo benchmarks and
long horizon planning demonstrate that our approach can achieve an 8.7%
improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup

Result: 符号知识显著加速了DMARL的学习过程。

Conclusion: 符号知识能有效解决DMARL中的独特挑战，并提升学习效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a
single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems
require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For
example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of
a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL
(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at
execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local
policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this
paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help
address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,
communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend
the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the
team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in
more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge
about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly
expedite the learning process in DMARL.

Conclusion: CAFT首次将多令牌预测引入后训练阶段，为研究社区提供了更高效的工具，并暗示了更广泛的机器学习研究意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

Result: Jarzynski重加权能够减少离散化误差、提升样本质量，并纠正对比散度的偏差，核选择对模型性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: Jarzynski重加权是一种有潜力的工具，可为生成学习提供更理论化的支持。

Abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) provide a flexible framework for generative
modeling, but their training remains theoretically challenging due to the need
to approximate normalization constants and efficiently sample from complex,
multi-modal distributions. Traditional methods, such as contrastive divergence
and score matching, introduce biases that can hinder accurate learning. In this
work, we present a theoretical analysis of Jarzynski reweighting, a technique
from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and its implications for training
EBMs. We focus on the role of the choice of the kernel and we illustrate these
theoretical considerations in two key generative frameworks: (i) flow-based
diffusion models, where we reinterpret Jarzynski reweighting in the context of
stochastic interpolants to mitigate discretization errors and improve sample
quality, and (ii) Restricted Boltzmann Machines, where we analyze its role in
correcting the biases of contrastive divergence. Our results provide insights
into the interplay between kernel choice and model performance, highlighting
the potential of Jarzynski reweighting as a principled tool for generative
learning.

Result: 在15个真实图数据上验证，RR-GNN在效率和覆盖性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RR-GNN为高风险领域的图数据建模提供了更可靠的预测框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling relational data but face
significant challenges in high-stakes domains due to unquantified uncertainty.
Conformal prediction (CP) offers statistical coverage guarantees, but existing
methods often produce overly conservative prediction intervals that fail to
account for graph heteroscedasticity and structural biases. While residual
reweighting CP variants address some of these limitations, they neglect graph
topology, cluster-specific uncertainties, and risk data leakage by reusing
training sets. To address these issues, we propose Residual Reweighted GNN
(RR-GNN), a framework designed to generate minimal prediction sets with
provable marginal coverage guarantees.
  RR-GNN introduces three major innovations to enhance prediction performance.
First, it employs Graph-Structured Mondrian CP to partition nodes or edges into
communities based on topological features, ensuring cluster-conditional
coverage that reflects heterogeneity. Second, it uses Residual-Adaptive
Nonconformity Scores by training a secondary GNN on a held-out calibration set
to estimate task-specific residuals, dynamically adjusting prediction intervals
according to node or edge uncertainty. Third, it adopts a Cross-Training
Protocol, which alternates the optimization of the primary GNN and the residual
predictor to prevent information leakage while maintaining graph dependencies.
We validate RR-GNN on 15 real-world graphs across diverse tasks, including node
classification, regression, and edge weight prediction. Compared to CP
baselines, RR-GNN achieves improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods,
with no loss of coverage.

Result: 实验验证了这些边界的紧密性和实际相关性，适用于多种公平性学习算法。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计提升公平性泛化的算法提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in promoting fairness in high-stake applications
using machine learning models, existing methods often modify the training
process, such as through regularizers or other interventions, but lack formal
guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen
data. Although overfitting with respect to prediction performance has been
extensively studied, overfitting in terms of fairness loss has received far
less attention. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing
fairness generalization error through an information-theoretic lens. Our novel
bounding technique is based on Efron-Stein inequality, which allows us to
derive tight information-theoretic fairness generalization bounds with both
Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). Our empirical
results validate the tightness and practical relevance of these bounds across
diverse fairness-aware learning algorithms. Our framework offers valuable
insights to guide the design of algorithms improving fairness generalization.

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous
monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous
glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive
models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory
constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential
Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating
the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential
processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term
dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized
for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced
loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic
events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend,
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap
between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a
reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN,
DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and
pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical
findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis
in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging
practices.

Result: 该方法首次实现了扩散模型中的高级语义身份保留，并在因果控制和身份保留之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为反事实图像生成提供了新的解决方案，展示了语义控制在扩散模型中的潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and
flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data
such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical
applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous
functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce
$\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function
spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder
architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate
continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly
incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural
constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples
satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax
optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that
diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable
regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff
across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical
results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high
fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and
low-resolution data. Code and datasets are publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部预处理协议（如分词器和变分自编码器）统一多模态数据表示，但这对数据有限的应用存在问题。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的框架，支持在任意状态空间上构建多模态扩散模型，并引入解耦的噪声调度策略，实现无条件生成和模态条件生成。

Result: 在文本-图像生成和混合类型表格数据合成任务中，该方法表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态数据生成提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

Motivation: 从观测数据中估计因果效应是许多应用的基础，但现有方法需要大量手动选择和专业知识。

Method: 结合贝叶斯因果推断和先验拟合网络（PFNs）的大规模训练协议，直接映射观测数据到因果效应。

Conclusion: CausalPFN提供了一种无需额外训练或调参的自动化因果推断解决方案，支持可靠的决策。

Abstract: Causal effect estimation from observational data is fundamental across
various applications. However, selecting an appropriate estimator from dozens
of specialized methods demands substantial manual effort and domain expertise.
We present CausalPFN, a single transformer that amortizes this workflow:
trained once on a large library of simulated data-generating processes that
satisfy ignorability, it infers causal effects for new observational datasets
out-of-the-box. CausalPFN combines ideas from Bayesian causal inference with
the large-scale training protocol of prior-fitted networks (PFNs), learning to
map raw observations directly to causal effects without any task-specific
adjustment. Our approach achieves superior average performance on heterogeneous
and average treatment effect estimation benchmarks (IHDP, Lalonde, ACIC).
Moreover, it shows competitive performance for real-world policy making on
uplift modeling tasks. CausalPFN provides calibrated uncertainty estimates to
support reliable decision-making based on Bayesian principles. This
ready-to-use model does not require any further training or tuning and takes a
step toward automated causal inference (https://github.com/vdblm/CausalPFN).

Motivation: 探讨非线性在循环网络中的功能作用，明确其计算必要性和机制。

Method: 使用几乎线性循环神经网络（AL-RNNs）作为建模工具和内存机制探针。

Result: 最小非线性不仅足够，而且通常最优，模型更简单、鲁棒和可解释。

Conclusion: 为选择性引入非线性提供了原则性框架，连接动态系统理论与循环网络的功能需求。

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

Motivation: 现有SSMs的性能高度依赖于状态矩阵的选择和初始化，因此需要一种更高效且理论支持的方法。

Method: 基于SaFARi框架和WaLRUS SSMs，引入W4S4，利用冗余小波框架构建，支持稳定对角化和快速核计算。

Result: W4S4在延迟重构、分类基准和长序列建模任务中表现优于HiPPO-based SSMs。

Conclusion: W4S4为下一代基于SSM的深度模型提供了可扩展且通用的基础。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful components for sequence
modeling, enabling efficient handling of long-range dependencies via linear
recurrence and convolutional computation. However, their effectiveness depends
heavily on the choice and initialization of the state matrix. In this work, we
build on the SaFARi framework and existing WaLRUS SSMs to introduce a new
variant, W4S4 (WaLRUS for S4), a new class of SSMs constructed from redundant
wavelet frames. WaLRUS admits a stable diagonalization and supports fast kernel
computation without requiring low-rank approximations, making it both
theoretically grounded and computationally efficient. We show that WaLRUS
retains information over long horizons significantly better than HiPPO-based
SSMs, both in isolation and when integrated into deep architectures such as S4.
Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across delay reconstruction
tasks, classification benchmarks, and long-range sequence modeling, confirming
that high-quality, structured initialization enabled by wavelet-based state
dynamic offers substantial advantages over existing alternatives. WaLRUS
provides a scalable and versatile foundation for the next generation of deep
SSM-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析因数据截尾问题面临挑战，传统集成模型因样本变化导致预测不稳定。

Method: 提出SurvBESA，结合Beran估计器和自注意力机制，调整生存函数相似性以平滑噪声。

Result: 数值实验表明SurvBESA优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SurvBESA通过自注意力机制有效提升预测稳定性，公开实现可用。

Abstract: Survival analysis predicts the time until an event of interest, such as
failure or death, but faces challenges due to censored data, where some events
remain unobserved. Ensemble-based models, like random survival forests and
gradient boosting, are widely used but can produce unstable predictions due to
variations in bootstrap samples. To address this, we propose SurvBESA (Survival
Beran Estimators Self-Attended), a novel ensemble model that combines Beran
estimators with a self-attention mechanism. Unlike traditional methods,
SurvBESA applies self-attention to predicted survival functions, smoothing out
noise by adjusting each survival function based on its similarity to
neighboring survival functions. We also explore a special case using Huber's
contamination model to define attention weights, simplifying training to a
quadratic or linear optimization problem. Numerical experiments show that
SurvBESA outperforms state-of-the-art models. The implementation of SurvBESA is
publicly available.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示现有文本分类保护模型（如防提示注入攻击、有毒输入等）可能因分词策略而被绕过，导致目标模型仍易受攻击。

Method: 提出TokenBreak攻击方法，通过操纵输入文本使保护模型错误分类，同时目标模型仍能理解并响应。

Result: 研究发现某些模型家族因分词策略易受攻击，并提出无需重新训练保护模型的防御策略。

Conclusion: 结论指出TokenBreak攻击的有效性，并强调防御策略的重要性以增强保护模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are used for text-related tasks such
as classification and generation. To complete these tasks, input data is first
tokenized from human-readable text into a format the model can understand,
enabling it to make inferences and understand context. Text classification
models can be implemented to guard against threats such as prompt injection
attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), toxic input and cybersecurity
risks such as spam emails. In this paper, we introduce TokenBreak: a novel
attack that can bypass these protection models by taking advantage of the
tokenization strategy they use. This attack technique manipulates input text in
such a way that certain models give an incorrect classification. Importantly,
the end target (LLM or email recipient) can still understand and respond to the
manipulated text and therefore be vulnerable to the very attack the protection
model was put in place to prevent. The tokenizer is tied to model architecture,
meaning it is possible to predict whether or not a model is vulnerable to
attack based on family. We also present a defensive strategy as an added layer
of protection that can be implemented without having to retrain the defensive
model.

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证，尤其在任务难度差异大的情况下，新策略能以更低预算达到与传统方法相同的估计精度。

Conclusion: 新方法在预算有限的情况下显著提高了生成式AI系统评估的效率，尤其适用于任务难度差异大的场景。

Abstract: The development lifecycle of generative AI systems requires continual
evaluation, data acquisition, and annotation, which is costly in both resources
and time. In practice, rapid iteration often makes it necessary to rely on
synthetic annotation data because of the low cost, despite the potential for
substantial bias. In this paper, we develop novel, cost-aware methods for
actively balancing the use of a cheap, but often inaccurate, weak rater -- such
as a model-based autorater that is designed to automatically assess the quality
of generated content -- with a more expensive, but also more accurate, strong
rater alternative such as a human. More specifically, the goal of our approach
is to produce a low variance, unbiased estimate of the mean of the target
"strong" rating, subject to some total annotation budget. Building on recent
work in active and prediction-powered statistical inference, we derive a family
of cost-optimal policies for allocating a given annotation budget between weak
and strong raters so as to maximize statistical efficiency. Using synthetic and
real-world data, we empirically characterize the conditions under which these
policies yield improvements over prior methods. We find that, especially in
tasks where there is high variability in the difficulty of examples, our
policies can achieve the same estimation precision at a far lower total
annotation budget than standard evaluation methods.

Motivation: cPIKANs在解决偏微分方程（PDEs）方面表现出潜力，但其训练动态和收敛行为缺乏理论和数值研究。本文旨在通过NTK理论填补这一空白。

Method: 使用NTK理论分析cPIKANs，推导其核结构在梯度训练中的演变，并研究NTK矩阵的谱特性（如特征值分布和谱偏差）对四种典型PDE的影响。

Result: 研究发现cPIKANs的NTK行为可预测，揭示了标准PINNs无法捕捉的学习动态，并明确了域分解对训练的改进条件。

Conclusion: 这是首次对cPIKANs进行系统的NTK研究，为理解其经验表现提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), and in particular their
Chebyshev-based variants (cPIKANs), have recently emerged as promising models
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their training
dynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically
and numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding
of cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our
objective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout
gradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We
first derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend
the analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral
properties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and
spectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz
equation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations
governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation
into the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order,
second-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the
resulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in
the context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also
reveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel
behavior to convergence rates under different setups. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs, providing
theoretical insight that clarifies and predicts their empirical performance.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注低速流体流动，而高速流动（如接近或超过音速）存在激波等突变现象，需要自适应时间步长方法。

Method: ShockCast分为两阶段：第一阶段用机器学习预测时间步长，第二阶段将预测步长与当前流体场结合推进系统状态。

Result: 通过生成两个超音速流动数据集验证了方法的有效性，代码和数据已公开。

Conclusion: ShockCast是首个学习高速流动的框架，为相关研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of modeling high-speed flows using machine learning
methods. While most prior studies focus on low-speed fluid flows in which
uniform time-stepping is practical, flows approaching and exceeding the speed
of sound exhibit sudden changes such as shock waves. In such cases, it is
essential to use adaptive time-stepping methods to allow a temporal resolution
sufficient to resolve these phenomena while simultaneously balancing
computational costs. Here, we propose a two-phase machine learning method,
known as ShockCast, to model high-speed flows with adaptive time-stepping. In
the first phase, we propose to employ a machine learning model to predict the
timestep size. In the second phase, the predicted timestep is used as an input
along with the current fluid fields to advance the system state by the
predicted timestep. We explore several physically-motivated components for
timestep prediction and introduce timestep conditioning strategies inspired by
neural ODE and Mixture of Experts. As ShockCast is the first framework for
learning high-speed flows, we evaluate our methods by generating two supersonic
flow datasets, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/divelab. Our code
is publicly available as part of the AIRS library
(https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分衡量LLM在组合优化问题中的能力，需更严谨的基准。

Method: 引入HeuriGym框架，让LLM生成启发式算法并通过代码执行反馈迭代优化，使用QYI指标评估性能。

Result: 测试9个顶级模型，QYI最高仅0.6，远低于专家基线1，显示LLM在工具使用、规划和自适应推理上的局限。

Conclusion: HeuriGym为LLM在科学和工程领域的实际问题解决能力提供了开源基准，指导未来发展。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.

Result: 在多个网络架构和数据集上，LSH框架在固定训练预算和剪枝比例下，找到了性能优于密集网络的剪枝模型。

Conclusion: LSH框架为网络剪枝提供了一种高效且性能优越的新方法。

Abstract: A variety of pruning methods have been introduced for over-parameterized
Recurrent Neural Networks to improve efficiency in terms of power consumption
and storage utilization. These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed
`hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for
a given network architecture and application. Unlike conventional
hyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains
uncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model
sets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one. The goal, therefore, is to
discover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.
However, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally
expensive and lacks early performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early
comparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of
post-training performance. By integrating this LS-based distance with standard
hyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning
framework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). LSH reduces search time by an
order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full
training. Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn
Treebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under
fixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies
superior pruned models. Remarkably, these pruned variants not only outperform
those selected by loss-based baseline but also exceed the performance of their
dense counterpart.

Motivation: 当前测试时间扩展范式依赖于生成长推理轨迹（“多思考”）后再响应，但这种方法无法让代理从环境中获取新信息或随时间调整行为，因此需要探索交互扩展的可能性。

Conclusion: 交互扩展是扩展每步计算能力的强大补充维度，为训练自适应代理提供了新途径。

Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling
per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

Result: 基于巴塞罗那真实数据的评估表明，DesRUTGe在生成交通模式时比RouteSampler等工具更准确且保护隐私。

Abstract: Realistic urban traffic simulation is essential for sustainable urban
planning and the development of intelligent transportation systems. However,
generating high-fidelity, time-varying traffic profiles that accurately reflect
real-world conditions, especially in large-scale scenarios, remains a major
challenge. Existing methods often suffer from limitations in accuracy,
scalability, or raise privacy concerns due to centralized data processing. This
work introduces DesRUTGe (Decentralized Realistic Urban Traffic Generator), a
novel framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents with
the SUMO simulator to generate realistic 24-hour traffic patterns. A key
innovation of DesRUTGe is its use of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL),
wherein each traffic detector and its corresponding urban zone function as an
independent learning node. These nodes train local DRL models using minimal
historical data and collaboratively refine their performance by exchanging
model parameters with selected peers (e.g., geographically adjacent zones),
without requiring a central coordinator. Evaluated using real-world data from
the city of Barcelona, DesRUTGe outperforms standard SUMO-based tools such as
RouteSampler, as well as other centralized learning approaches, by delivering
more accurate and privacy-preserving traffic pattern generation.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前生成模型在新领域的局限性，强调了对生成模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of
artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models
remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this
challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that
uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically,
POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a
fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral
properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function
with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that
make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in

Result: 通过模拟联盟形成过程，验证了AI方法在大规模民主文本编辑中的有效性。

Conclusion: 结论表明AI可以促进大规模民主文本编辑，填补传统工具的不足。

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental
to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on
this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition
formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo,
using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in
this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent
coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains
an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates
agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to
generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document
writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our
approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models
to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design
algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To
evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that
AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where
traditional tools are limited.

Method: 采用个体学习局部效用函数和团队共享协作知识的LIET范式，结合集中训练与分散执行。

Result: 在Communicative Watch-And-Help和ThreeD-World基准测试中，LIET表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LIET通过个体与团队的协同进化，显著提升了LLM在多智能体环境中的规划与协作能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong
reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent
planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities
and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based
planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to
multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a
framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during
test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better
planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by
centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)}
paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents
learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend
the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support
informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and
iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on
new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining
individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and
flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative
Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate
that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing
baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

Result: 在电池生产线案例中，成功防止26%和63%的吞吐量下降，优化器平均0.03秒找到最优配置。

Conclusion: 该框架有效应对干扰，显著提升制造系统适应性和吞吐量。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern manufacturing, coupled with demand
fluctuation, supply chain uncertainties, and product customization, underscores
the need for manufacturing systems that can flexibly update their
configurations and swiftly adapt to disturbances. However, current research
falls short in providing a holistic reconfigurable manufacturing framework that
seamlessly monitors system disturbances, optimizes alternative line
configurations based on machine capabilities, and automates simulation
evaluation for swift adaptations. This paper presents a dynamic manufacturing
line reconfiguration framework to handle disturbances that result in operation
time changes. The framework incorporates a system process digital twin for
monitoring disturbances and triggering reconfigurations, a capability-based
ontology model capturing available agent and resource options, a configuration
optimizer generating optimal line configurations, and a simulation generation
program initializing simulation setups and evaluating line configurations at
approximately 400x real-time speed. A case study of a battery production line
has been conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. In two implemented
disturbance scenarios, the framework successfully recovers system throughput
with limited resources, preventing the 26% and 63% throughput drops that would
have occurred without a reconfiguration plan. The reconfiguration optimizer
efficiently finds optimal solutions, taking an average of 0.03 seconds to find
a reconfiguration plan for a manufacturing line with 51 operations and 40
available agents across 8 agent types.

Result: 在多个多代理游戏和软件工程模拟中，Shapley-Coop显著提升了LLM代理的协作效果，并实现了公平的信用分配。

Conclusion: Shapley-Coop通过有效的定价机制和激励对齐，成功解决了开放环境中LLM代理的协作问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in
multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended
environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested
ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment
-- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms
that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs
increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair
compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired
by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through
temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a
cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley
Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for
pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching,
enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and
post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters
cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two
multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it
consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit
assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing
mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task
execution.

Motivation: 现有多代理系统（MAS）的记忆机制过于简单，忽视了代理间协作的复杂性，且缺乏跨试验和代理定制化，限制了系统的自我进化能力。

Method: 提出G-Memory，一种基于组织记忆理论的分层记忆系统，通过三层图（洞察图、查询图和交互图）管理代理间交互，并支持双向记忆检索。

Result: 在五个基准测试、三种LLM骨干和三种MAS框架中，G-Memory将任务成功率提高了20.89%，知识问答准确率提高了10.12%。

Conclusion: G-Memory通过改进记忆架构，显著提升了多代理系统的协作能力和自我进化潜力，且无需修改现有框架。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

Motivation: 探讨集体决策中责任扩散的普遍问题，明确个体责任模糊的原因。

Method: 通过定义决策机制的互模拟，证明互模拟保留责任相关属性，并在最小互模拟机制中验证结果。

Result: 在双代理人场景中，避免责任扩散需独裁决策；多代理人场景中需选举独裁者。

Conclusion: 避免责任扩散的唯一方式是引入独裁决策机制，无论代理人数量多少。

Abstract: The term "diffusion of responsibility'' refers to situations in which
multiple agents share responsibility for an outcome, obscuring individual
accountability. This paper examines this frequently undesirable phenomenon in
the context of collective decision-making mechanisms.
  The work shows that if a decision is made by two agents, then the only way to
avoid diffusion of responsibility is for one agent to act as a "dictator'',
making the decision unilaterally. In scenarios with more than two agents, any
diffusion-free mechanism is an "elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a
single agent to make a unilateral decision.
  The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of
decision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves
responsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest
bisimular mechanism.

Abstract: Differentiable programming has revolutionised optimisation by enabling
efficient gradient-based training of complex models, such as Deep Neural
Networks (NNs) with billions and trillions of parameters. However, traditional
Evolutionary Computation (EC) and Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms, widely
successful in discrete or complex search spaces, typically do not leverage
local gradient information, limiting their optimisation efficiency. In this
paper, we introduce EvoGrad, a unified differentiable framework that integrates
EC and SI with gradient-based optimisation through backpropagation. EvoGrad
converts conventional evolutionary and swarm operators (e.g., selection,
mutation, crossover, and particle updates) into differentiable operators,
facilitating end-to-end gradient optimisation. Extensive experiments on
benchmark optimisation functions and training of small NN regressors reveal
that our differentiable versions of EC and SI metaheuristics consistently
outperform traditional, gradient-agnostic algorithms in most scenarios. Our
results show the substantial benefits of fully differentiable evolutionary and
swarm optimisation, setting a new standard for hybrid optimisation frameworks.

Abstract: Neural networks based on metric recognition methods have a strictly
determined architecture. Number of neurons, connections, as well as weights and
thresholds values are calculated analytically, based on the initial conditions
of tasks: number of recognizable classes, number of samples, metric expressions
used. This paper discusses the possibility of transforming these networks in
order to apply classical learning algorithms to them without using analytical
expressions that calculate weight values. In the received network, training is
carried out by recognizing images in pairs. This approach simplifies the
learning process and easily allows to expand the neural network by adding new
images to the recognition task. The advantages of these networks, including
such as: 1) network architecture simplicity and transparency; 2) training
simplicity and reliability; 3) the possibility of using a large number of
images in the recognition problem using a neural network; 4) a consistent
increase in the number of recognizable classes without changing the previous
values of weights and thresholds.

Motivation: 解决微电网间能源交易中的局部决策和全局能源平衡问题。

Result: 在100个微电网的模拟场景中，95个达到稳定能源状态。

Conclusion: 模型在个体和社区层面均能有效实现能源平衡。

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between
microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid
community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk
or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and
its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and
buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual
in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that
encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.
The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.
Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation
is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The
evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that
considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community
level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the
degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated
scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,
to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of
microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the
100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the
effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the
individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its
nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a
corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are
effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands
remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous
unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and
transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a
novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies
and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a
contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired
upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a
reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and
adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality.
Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show
that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving --
or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable
strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more
scalable bilevel optimization.

Abstract: Multi-state spiking neurons such as the adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire
(AdLIF) neuron offer compelling alternatives to conventional deep learning
models thanks to their sparse binary activations, second-order nonlinear
recurrent dynamics, and efficient hardware realizations. However, such internal
dynamics can cause instabilities during inference and training, often limiting
performance and scalability. Meanwhile, state space models (SSMs) excel in long
sequence processing using linear state-intrinsic recurrence resembling spiking
neurons' subthreshold regime. Here, we establish a mathematical bridge between
SSMs and second-order spiking neuron models. Based on structure and
parametrization strategies of diagonal SSMs, we propose two novel spiking
neuron models. The first extends the AdLIF neuron through timestep training and
logarithmic reparametrization to facilitate training and improve final
performance. The second additionally brings initialization and structure from
complex-state SSMs, broadening the dynamical regime to oscillatory dynamics.
Together, our two models achieve beyond or near state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performances for reset-based spiking neuron models across both event-based and
raw audio speech recognition datasets. We achieve this with a favorable number
of parameters and required dynamic memory while maintaining high activity
sparsity. Our models demonstrate enhanced scalability in network size and
strike a favorable balance between performance and efficiency with respect to
SSM models.

*Raoof HojatJalali,Edmondo Trentin*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于离散傅里叶变换（DFT）的图像表示学习方法，替代传统的输入重建目标，通过聚焦频率分量提升表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自编码器以原始输入为重建目标，而DFT能提供全局频率信息，更灵活且高效。

Method: 使用DFT作为重建目标，选择特定频率分量进行训练，验证其在多维数据中的灵活性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上达到52.8%的top-1准确率，比传统自编码器高12.8个百分点。

Conclusion: DFT是一种有效的表示学习目标，且仅使用低频分量也能达到接近全频谱的效果。

Abstract: Image Representation learning via input reconstruction is a common technique
in machine learning for generating representations that can be effectively
utilized by arbitrary downstream tasks. A well-established approach is using
autoencoders to extract latent representations at the network's compression
point. These representations are valuable because they retain essential
information necessary for reconstructing the original input from the compressed
latent space. In this paper, we propose an alternative learning objective.
Instead of using the raw input as the reconstruction target, we employ the
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the input. The DFT provides meaningful
global information at each frequency level, making individual frequency
components useful as separate learning targets. When dealing with
multidimensional input data, the DFT offers remarkable flexibility by enabling
selective transformation across specific dimensions while preserving others in
the computation. Moreover, certain types of input exhibit distinct patterns in
their frequency distributions, where specific frequency components consistently
contain most of the magnitude, allowing us to focus on a subset of frequencies
rather than the entire spectrum. These characteristics position the DFT as a
viable learning objective for representation learning and we validate our
approach by achieving 52.8% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 and
outperforming the traditional autoencoder by 12.8 points under identical
architectural configurations. Additionally, we demonstrate that training on
only the lower-frequency components - those with the highest magnitudes yields
results comparable to using the full frequency spectrum, with only minimal
reductions in accuracy.

Motivation: 研究生物合理学习规则是否既能满足神经任务表现，又能与神经记录对齐，填补了后者研究的空白。

Method: 采用Procrustes分析等方法，比较e-prop和BPTT在神经相似性上的表现，并探讨模型架构和初始条件的影响。

Result: e-prop在神经相似性上与BPTT相当，且模型架构和初始条件对相似性影响更大；两者在动态特性上相似。

Conclusion: 生物合理学习规则（如e-prop）在任务表现和神经相似性上均具潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain learns may be informed by studying biologically
plausible learning rules. These rules, often approximating gradient descent
learning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two
critical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good
neuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While
extensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains
underexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known
neuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically
plausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation
and has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can
achieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model
architecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in
determining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we
observe that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts
exhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results
underscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible
learning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task
performance and neural data similarity.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于改进Transformer和GAN融合的深度学习模型Deeptrans，用于高效预测翼型多参数气动性能，解决了传统方法成本高、效率低以及数据驱动模型精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统翼型气动性能预测方法（如风洞试验和CFD模拟）成本高、效率低，而现有数据驱动模型在多目标预测中面临精度不足和数据依赖性强的问题。

Method: 通过构建大规模数据集，结合Transformer编码-解码框架和对抗训练，设计了Deeptrans模型，实现了多参数气动性能的高精度同步预测。

Result: 实验表明，Deeptrans在验证集上的MSE损失降至5.6*10-6，单样本预测时间仅0.0056秒，效率比传统CFD方法提高近700倍，且预测精度显著优于原始Transformer、GAN和VAE模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为翼型气动性能预测提供了高效的数据驱动解决方案，并为深度学习建模复杂流动问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Predicting of airfoil aerodynamic performance is a key part of aircraft
design optimization, but the traditional methods (such as wind tunnel test and
CFD simulation) have the problems of high cost and low efficiency, and the
existing data-driven models face the challenges of insufficient accuracy and
strong data dependence in multi-objective prediction. Therefore, this study
proposes a deep learning model, Deeptrans, based on the fusion of improved
Transformer and generative Adversarial network (GAN), which aims to predict the
multi-parameter aerodynamic performance of airfoil efficiently. By constructing
a large-scale data set and designing a model structure that integrates a
Transformer coding-decoding framework and confrontation training, synchronous
and high-precision prediction of aerodynamic parameters is realized.
Experiments show that the MSE loss of Deeptrans on the verification set is
reduced to 5.6*10-6, and the single-sample prediction time is only 0.0056
seconds, which is nearly 700 times more efficient than the traditional CFD
method. Horizontal comparison shows that the prediction accuracy is
significantly better than the original Transformer, GAN, and VAE models. This
study provides an efficient data-driven solution for airfoil aerodynamic
performance prediction and a new idea for deep learning modeling complex flow
problems.

Motivation: 当前RNN研究主要集中于积分或脉冲神经元，而微分神经元的研究局限于小型网络。本文旨在探索大规模微分神经元网络的行为及其在神经形态计算中的应用。

Method: 通过数值模拟，研究未耦合环振荡器的周期性轨道，以及耦合后环振荡器之间的局部相关性及其动态行为。

Result: 耦合环振荡器表现出局部同步行为，形成大区域同步和薄域边界，相关区域的稳态尺度取决于神经元共享方式。

Conclusion: 微分神经网络因其简单电路设计和低功耗潜力，有望成为神经形态计算的理想平台，支持低功耗AI应用。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are machine learning models widely used for
learning temporal relationships. Current state-of-the-art RNNs use integrating
or spiking neurons -- two classes of computing units whose outputs depend
directly on their internal states -- and accordingly there is a wealth of
literature characterizing the behavior of large networks built from these
neurons. On the other hand, past research on differentiating neurons, whose
outputs are computed from the derivatives of their internal states, remains
limited to small hand-designed networks with fewer than one-hundred neurons.
Here we show via numerical simulation that large lattices of differentiating
neuron rings exhibit local neural synchronization behavior found in the
Kuramoto model of interacting oscillators. We begin by characterizing the
periodic orbits of uncoupled rings, herein called ring oscillators. We then
show the emergence of local correlations between oscillators that grow over
time when these rings are coupled together into lattices. As the correlation
length grows, transient dynamics arise in which large regions of the lattice
settle to the same periodic orbit, and thin domain boundaries separate
adjacent, out-of-phase regions. The steady-state scale of these correlated
regions depends on how the neurons are shared between adjacent rings, which
suggests that lattices of differentiating ring oscillator might be tuned to be
used as reservoir computers. Coupled with their simple circuit design and
potential for low-power consumption, differentiating neural nets therefore
represent a promising substrate for neuromorphic computing that will enable
low-power AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视觉语音分离方法通常架构复杂且依赖未来上下文，无法满足实时需求。

Method: 采用轻量级视觉特征提取模块、高效融合模块和分组SRUs整合历史信息，并提出因果转换模板。

Result: 在LRS2、LRS3和VoxCeleb2数据集上表现出色，适用于复杂环境。

Conclusion: Swift-Net展示了在实时音频-视觉语音分离中的潜力，尤其适合复杂环境。

Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) aims to extract a target speech signal
from a mixed signal by leveraging both auditory and visual (lip movement) cues.
However, most existing AVSS methods exhibit complex architectures and rely on
future context, operating offline, which renders them unsuitable for real-time
applications. Inspired by the pipeline of RTFSNet, we propose a novel streaming
AVSS model, named Swift-Net, which enhances the causal processing capabilities
required for real-time applications. Swift-Net adopts a lightweight visual
feature extraction module and an efficient fusion module for audio-visual
integration. Additionally, Swift-Net employs Grouped SRUs to integrate
historical information across different feature spaces, thereby improving the
utilization efficiency of historical information. We further propose a causal
transformation template to facilitate the conversion of non-causal AVSS models
into causal counterparts. Experiments on three standard benchmark datasets
(LRS2, LRS3, and VoxCeleb2) demonstrated that under causal conditions, our
proposed Swift-Net exhibited outstanding performance, highlighting the
potential of this method for processing speech in complex environments.

TL;DR: 研究评估了五种大型音频语言模型在零样本音频欺骗检测任务中的表现，并探讨了量化（FP32、FP16、INT8）对其性能的影响。结果显示，尽管初始检测准确率高，但模型普遍存在对欺骗分类的预测偏差。FP16量化对性能影响小，而INT8量化显著降低平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是资源受限环境中部署大型音频语言模型的关键技术，但其对复杂任务（如零样本音频欺骗检测）的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究评估了五种模型（GAMA、LTU-AS、MERaLiON、Qwen-Audio、SALMONN）在三个数据集（ASVspoof2019、In-the-Wild、WaveFake）上的零样本能力，并测试了不同量化精度（FP32、FP16、INT8）的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型普遍存在对欺骗分类的预测偏差，FP16量化对性能影响小，INT8量化显著降低平衡准确率。

Conclusion: FP16量化是实用部署和未来模型优化的最佳折衷方案。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large audio language models (LALMs)
efficiently in resource-constrained environments. However, its impact on
complex tasks, such as zero-shot audio spoofing detection, remains
underexplored. This study evaluates the zero-shot capabilities of five LALMs,
GAMA, LTU-AS, MERaLiON, Qwen-Audio, and SALMONN, across three distinct
datasets: ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and WaveFake, and investigates their
robustness to quantization (FP32, FP16, INT8). Despite high initial spoof
detection accuracy, our analysis demonstrates severe predictive biases toward
spoof classification across all models, rendering their practical performance
equivalent to random classification. Interestingly, quantization to FP16
precision resulted in negligible performance degradation compared to FP32,
effectively halving memory and computational requirements without materially
impacting accuracy. However, INT8 quantization intensified model biases,
significantly degrading balanced accuracy. These findings highlight critical
architectural limitations and emphasize FP16 quantization as an optimal
trade-off, providing guidelines for practical deployment and future model
refinement.

Abstract: The ultimate purpose of generative music AI is music production. The
studio-lab, a social form within the art-science branch of
cross-disciplinarity, is a way to advance music production with AI music
models. During a studio-lab experiment involving researchers, music producers,
and an AI model for music generating bass-like audio, it was observed that the
producers used the model's output to convey two or more pitches with a single
harmonic complex tone, which in turn revealed that the model had learned to
generate structured and coherent simultaneous melodic lines using monophonic
sequences of harmonic complex tones. These findings prompt a reconsideration of
the long-standing debate on whether humans can perceive harmonics as distinct
pitches and highlight how generative AI can not only enhance musical creativity
but also contribute to a deeper understanding of music.

Abstract: Accurate, low-latency endpointing is crucial for effective spoken dialogue

building upon recent advancements in neural audio codecs. To further reduce

Conclusion: RBA-FE不仅提升了抑郁症诊断的准确性，还通过ARSLIF模型提供了脑启发的可解释性。

Abstract: This article proposes a robust brain-inspired audio feature extractor
(RBA-FE) model for depression diagnosis, using an improved hierarchical network
architecture. Most deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance
for image-based diagnostic tasks, ignoring the counterpart audio features. In
order to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features
extracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and
temporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision
limitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep
residual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model
incorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth
leaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF). The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of
``retuning of cellular signal selectivity" in the brain attention systems,
which enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data.
Experimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
on the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in
precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014
and DAIC-WOZ datasets both show enhancements in noise robustness. It is further
indicated by comparison that the ARSLIF neuron model suggest the abnormal
firing pattern within the feature extraction on depressive audio data, offering
brain-inspired interpretability.

Result: 在Surge XT合成器上，该方法在音频重建指标上优于回归和生成基线。

Conclusion: 通过建模参数分布和对称性，显著改善了音频合成器参数反演的性能。

Abstract: Many audio synthesizers can produce the same signal given different parameter
configurations, meaning the inversion from sound to parameters is an inherently
ill-posed problem. We show that this is largely due to intrinsic symmetries of
the synthesizer, and focus in particular on permutation invariance. First, we
demonstrate on a synthetic task that regressing point estimates under
permutation symmetry degrades performance, even when using a
permutation-invariant loss function or symmetry-breaking heuristics. Then,
viewing equivalent solutions as modes of a probability distribution, we show
that a conditional generative model substantially improves performance.
Further, acknowledging the invariance of the implicit parameter distribution,
we find that performance is further improved by using a permutation equivariant
continuous normalizing flow. To accommodate intricate symmetries in real
synthesizers, we also propose a relaxed equivariance strategy that adaptively
discovers relevant symmetries from data. Applying our method to Surge XT, a
full-featured open source synthesizer used in real world audio production, we
find our method outperforms regression and generative baselines across audio
reconstruction metrics.

Result: SASTNet在CodecFake+数据集的CoSG测试集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SASTNet有效解决了CodecFake语音溯源的泛化问题，性能领先。

Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech
(CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG)
models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source
tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance
on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show
that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to
non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate
these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network

*Haoyuan Yang,Yue Zhang,Liqiang Jing*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态后校正框架，通过利用视频中的上下文信息来改进ASR转录准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在复杂环境（如电视剧）中表现不佳，现有方法未能充分利用视频中的丰富信息。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：ASR生成和基于视频的后校正，结合VLMM和LLM提取和利用上下文信息。

Result: 在电视剧ASR多模态基准测试中，该方法显著提升了转录准确性。

Conclusion: 视频上下文信息能有效提升ASR在复杂多媒体环境中的性能。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep
learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media
transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle
in complex environments such as TV series, where overlapping speech,
domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose
significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing multimodal
approaches fail to correct ASR outputs with the rich temporal and contextual
information available in video. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
multimodal post-correction framework that refines ASR transcriptions by
leveraging contextual cues extracted from video. Our framework consists of two
stages: ASR Generation and Video-based Post-Correction, where the first stage
produces the initial transcript and the second stage corrects errors using
Video-based Contextual Information Extraction and Context-aware ASR Correction.
We employ the Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to extract key contextual
information using tailored prompts, which is then integrated with a Large
Language Model (LLM) to refine the ASR output. We evaluate our method on a
multimodal benchmark for TV series ASR and demonstrate its effectiveness in
improving ASR performance by leveraging video-based context to enhance
transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.

*Paritosh Ranjan,Surajit Majumder,Prodip Roy*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种在通话中传输紧急语音消息的新方法，利用生成式AI技术自动生成上下文感知的音频消息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统移动电话在紧急情况下无法传递紧急语音消息的问题，尤其是当被叫方正在通话时。

Method: 结合生成式AI（如GPT Neo）生成文本并合成音频，通过优先级推断机制绕过传统呼叫等待限制。

Result: 系统能够生成并传递紧急语音消息，最小化通话干扰的同时保持紧急性。

Conclusion: 该方法在电信、移动设备和紧急通信平台中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: In critical situations, conventional mobile telephony fails to convey
emergency voice messages to a callee already engaged in another call. The
standard call waiting alert does not provide the urgency or content of the
waiting call. This paper proposes a novel method for transmitting Generative
Voice Bursts short, context aware audio messages during ongoing calls, from
either preauthorized or dynamically prioritized callers. By leveraging
generative AI techniques, the system automatically generates spoken messages
from contextual inputs example like location, health data, images, background
noise when the caller is unable to speak due to incapacitation or environmental
constraints. The solution incorporates voice, text, and priority inference
mechanisms, allowing high priority emergency messages to bypass conventional
call waiting barriers. The approach employs models such as GPT Neo for
generative text, which is synthesized into audio and delivered in configurable
intervals G seconds and counts N times, ensuring minimal disruption while
preserving urgency. This method holds potential for significant impact across
telecom, mobile device manufacturing, and emergency communication platforms.

*Kuiyuan Zhang,Wenjie Pei,Rushi Lan,Yifang Guo,Zhongyun Hua*

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级单流多模态学习框架，用于音频-视觉深度伪造检测，通过协作学习块和多模态分类模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立学习音频和视觉特征，未能充分利用其相关性，且模型冗余，效率低下。

Method: 设计协作音频-视觉学习块实现多模态特征融合，提出多模态分类模块增强模态依赖性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，模型仅0.48M参数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，能有效检测多模态及未知类型深度伪造。

Abstract: Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading
misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio
manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly
employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual
features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection.
However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and
visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models
can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and
impractical for resource-constrained environments.
  In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake
detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we
introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate
multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By
iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a
continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network
efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive
block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of
the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the
whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio
and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and
DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint
detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M
parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal
deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI模型依赖高层次文本描述，而音乐制作需要更接近实际音乐控制的低层次特征，音高强度可能填补这一需求。

Method: 通过信号和感知分析，研究了音高强度在歌曲内外的变化及其对音乐结构的影响。

Result: 音高强度在歌曲内外差异显著，影响音乐大小结构，处理复调不和谐音，并可能与听觉感知丰富性相关。

Conclusion: 音高强度作为低层次特征，有望提升生成式AI模型在音乐制作中的实用性。

Abstract: Music information retrieval distinguishes between low- and high-level
descriptions of music. Current generative AI models rely on text descriptions
that are higher level than the controls familiar to studio musicians. Pitch
strength, a low-level perceptual parameter of contemporary popular music, may
be one feature that could make such AI models more suited to music production.
Signal and perceptual analyses suggest that pitch strength (1) varies
significantly across and inside songs; (2) contributes to both small- and
large-scale structure; (3) contributes to the handling of polyphonic
dissonance; and (4) may be a feature of upper harmonics made audible in a
perspective of perceptual richness.

Result: 系统实现了低延迟的离线语音控制，提升了鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 离线语音识别与物联网技术结合的智能家居方案更具可持续性和实用性。

Abstract: The smart home systems, based on AI speech recognition and IoT technology,
enable people to control devices through verbal commands and make people's
lives more efficient. However, existing AI speech recognition services are
primarily deployed on cloud platforms on the Internet. When users issue a
command, speech recognition devices like ``Amazon Echo'' will post a recording
through numerous network nodes, reach multiple servers, and then receive
responses through the Internet. This mechanism presents several issues,
including unnecessary energy consumption, communication latency, and the risk
of a single-point failure. In this position paper, we propose a smart home
concept based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology: 1) integrating
offline keyword spotting (KWS) technologies into household appliances with
limited resource hardware to enable them to understand user voice commands; 2)
designing a local IoT network with decentralized architecture to manage and
connect various devices, enhancing the robustness and scalability of the
system. This proposal of a smart home based on offline speech recognition and
IoT technology will allow users to use low-latency voice control anywhere in
the home without depending on the Internet and provide better scalability and
energy sustainability.

Motivation: 现有方法在歌曲生成的复杂性、音质、音乐性和人声-乐器和谐度方面存在不足，亟需改进。

Method: LeVo采用LeLM并行建模混合令牌和双轨令牌，结合模块化扩展训练策略和多偏好对齐方法（基于DPO）。

Result: 实验表明，LeVo在客观和主观指标上均优于现有方法，消融研究验证了设计的有效性。

Conclusion: LeVo通过创新的框架和训练策略，显著提升了歌词到歌曲生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models
have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song
generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex
composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to
limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and
vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an
LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of
parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the
combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony,
and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for
high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a
modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different
token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we
introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a
semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental
results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both
objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the
effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples are available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite，一个用于主动触觉感知任务的开源基准测试套件，填补了触觉感知和主动感知领域缺乏标准化基准的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉感知能增强机器人操作的灵活性，但其局部性限制了全局场景理解。主动感知技术可以弥补这一缺陷，但相关领域缺乏标准化基准。

Method: 引入Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite，提供多样化的模拟场景和数据集，包括合成3D MNIST数字模型和真实触觉样本，并训练CycleGAN进行逼真渲染。

Result: 基准套件支持定位、分类和体积估计等任务，提供了标准化的协议和可复现的评估框架。

Conclusion: 该基准套件促进了触觉感知和主动感知领域的系统性进展。

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous
robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or
substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because
tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that
require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A
human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception
techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more
informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in
order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and
different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention
recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an
open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active
tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume
estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from
simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using
vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive
dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600
real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this
dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By
providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our
benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile
sensing and active perception.

Conclusion: CPS-Guard为安全和安全关键系统提供了结构化且可扩展的V&V解决方案。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to
operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and
validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic
nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel
framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative
assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g.,
safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning)
to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, CPS-Guard continuously
evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability
requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an
autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our
results show that CPS-Guard effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages
performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby
offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&V in safety- and
security-critical systems.

Motivation: 地下环境（如涵洞）光线昏暗且缺乏特征，机器人视觉面临挑战。现有照明方法存在反射、过曝和功耗问题。

Method: 提出NightHawk框架，利用在线贝叶斯优化动态调整光照强度和曝光时间，并基于特征检测器设计新指标作为优化目标。

Result: 实验表明，特征检测和匹配性能提升47-197%，视觉估计更可靠。

Conclusion: NightHawk有效解决了地下环境中的视觉挑战，提升了机器人导航能力。

Abstract: Subterranean environments such as culverts present significant challenges to
robot vision due to dim lighting and lack of distinctive features. Although
onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular
reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose
NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control
to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online
Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and
exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based
metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the
optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization
pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the
Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature
detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in
challenging lighting conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车载感知系统因遮挡和盲区精度有限，云端解决方案延迟高，无法满足实时需求，因此需要一种低延迟、高精度的协作感知框架。

Method: ECOD框架结合PACE（感知聚合与协作估计）和VOTE（基于共识的投票机制）算法，利用边缘计算和多车协作实现实时物体检测。

Result: 实验表明，ECOD在物体分类准确率上比传统单视角方法提升75%，同时保持低延迟。

Conclusion: 边缘计算能显著提升协作感知能力，适用于延迟敏感的自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board
perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,
while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them
unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative
framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that
leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,
multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key
algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and
Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data
from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where
individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting
mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data
from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in
real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We
develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped
robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our
experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of
improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional
single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,
edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of
edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive
autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 方法有效但存在传感器校准和学习方法局限性等问题，需进一步研究以推动大规模水下作业。

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs)
demand robust spatial perception capabilities, including Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM), to support both remote and autonomous tasks.
Vision-based systems have been integral to these advancements, capturing rich
color and texture at low cost while enabling semantic scene understanding.
However, underwater conditions -- such as light attenuation, backscatter, and
low contrast -- often degrade image quality to the point where traditional
vision-based SLAM pipelines fail. Moreover, these pipelines typically rely on
monocular or stereo inputs, limiting their scalability to the multi-camera
configurations common on many vehicles. To address these issues, we propose to
leverage multi-modal sensing that fuses data from multiple sensors-including
cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and acoustic devices-to enhance
situational awareness and enable robust, real-time SLAM. We explore both
geometric and learning-based techniques along with semantic analysis, and
conduct experiments on the data collected from a work-class ROV during several
field deployments in the Trondheim Fjord. Through our experimental results, we
demonstrate the feasibility of real-time reliable state estimation and
high-quality 3D reconstructions in visually challenging underwater conditions.
We also discuss system constraints and identify open research questions, such
as sensor calibration, limitations with learning-based methods, that merit
further exploration to advance large-scale underwater operations.

Result: 在HM3D、MP3D和HSSD基准测试中取得SOTA性能，SPL提升46.4%。

Conclusion: BeliefMapNav通过全局信念地图和高效路径规划，显著提升了零样本物体导航的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) allows robots to find target objects in
unfamiliar environments using natural language instructions, without relying on
pre-built maps or task-specific training. Recent general-purpose models, such
as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), equip agents
with semantic reasoning abilities to estimate target object locations in a
zero-shot manner. However, these models often greedily select the next goal
without maintaining a global understanding of the environment and are
fundamentally limited in the spatial reasoning necessary for effective
navigation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D voxel-based
belief map that estimates the target's prior presence distribution within a
voxelized 3D space. This approach enables agents to integrate semantic priors
from LLMs and visual embeddings with hierarchical spatial structure, alongside
real-time observations, to build a comprehensive 3D global posterior belief of
the target's location. Building on this 3D voxel map, we introduce
BeliefMapNav, an efficient navigation system with two key advantages: i)
grounding LLM semantic reasoning within the 3D hierarchical semantics voxel
space for precise target position estimation, and ii) integrating sequential
path planning to enable efficient global navigation decisions. Experiments on
HM3D, MP3D, and HSSD benchmarks show that BeliefMapNav achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length
(SPL), with a notable 46.4% SPL improvement over the previous best SR method,
validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和泛化能力上优于现有方法，同时开源了一个大规模数据集RefGraspNet。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation of unseen objects via natural language commands remains
challenging. Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp
poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. Here we introduce
Mask-guided feature pooling, a lightweight enhancement to existing LDRG
methods. Our approach employs a two-stage training strategy: first, a
vision-language model generates feature maps from CLIP-fused embeddings, which
are upsampled and weighted by text embeddings to produce segmentation masks.
Next, the decoder generates separate feature maps for grasp prediction, pooling
only token features within these masked regions to efficiently predict grasp
poses. This targeted pooling approach reduces computational complexity,
accelerating both training and inference. Incorporating mask pooling results in
a 12% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore,
we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than
existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for
open-vocabulary grasping. By extending 2D grasp predictions to 3D via depth
mapping and inverse kinematics, our modular method achieves performance
comparable to recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on the LIBERO
simulation benchmark, with improved generalization across different task
suites. Real-world experiments on a 7 DoF Franka robotic arm demonstrate a 57%
success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 7%. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境（如船舶压载水舱）中需要检查特定对象或结构（语义），这些环境通常具有重复的空间布局，因此需要一种能够利用这些重复模式的方法来优化检查路径规划。

Method: 提出了一种算法，用于识别语义场景图中的重复模式（精确或不精确），并基于这些模式预测未探索区域的语义布局。随后设计了两种针对压载水舱检查的路径规划策略。

Result: 通过仿真和实验验证，SPP方法在检查时间和语义表面覆盖率上均显著优于现有技术，且能够处理不完美的重复模式。

Conclusion: SPP方法通过利用语义重复模式，显著提升了工业环境中的检查效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel semantics-aware inspection path planning paradigm
called "Semantics-aware Predictive Planning" (SPP). Industrial environments
that require the inspection of specific objects or structures (called
"semantics"), such as ballast water tanks inside ships, often present
structured and repetitive spatial arrangements of the semantics of interest.
Motivated by this, we first contribute an algorithm that identifies spatially
repeating patterns of semantics - exact or inexact - in a semantic scene graph
representation and makes predictions about the evolution of the graph in the
unseen parts of the environment using these patterns. Furthermore, two
inspection path planning strategies, tailored to ballast water tank inspection,
that exploit these predictions are proposed. To assess the performance of the

Result: 实验表明，该方法能高效处理数百机器人的密集环境，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过路径优化和冲突避免，显著提升了多机器人任务分配的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: We consider the Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem that aims to
optimize an assignment of multiple robots to multiple tasks in challenging
environments which are with densely populated obstacles and narrow passages. In
such environments, conventional methods optimizing the sum-of-cost are often
ineffective because the conflicts between robots incur additional costs (e.g.,
collision avoidance, waiting). Also, an allocation that does not incorporate
the actual robot paths could cause deadlocks, which significantly degrade the
collective performance of the robots.
  We propose a scalable MRTA method that considers the paths of the robots to
avoid collisions and deadlocks which result in a fast completion of all tasks
(i.e., minimizing the \textit{makespan}). To incorporate robot paths into task
allocation, the proposed method constructs a roadmap using a Generalized
Voronoi Diagram. The method partitions the roadmap into several components to
know how to redistribute robots to achieve all tasks with less conflicts
between the robots. In the redistribution process, robots are transferred to
their final destinations according to a push-pop mechanism with the first-in
first-out principle. From the extensive experiments, we show that our method
can handle instances with hundreds of robots in dense clutter while competitors
are unable to compute a solution within a time limit.

Motivation: 传统3D场景表示（如点云和占用网格）缺乏语义组织，限制了机器人高级推理能力。3DSGs通过整合几何、拓扑和语义关系，提供了结构化表示，但现有研究主要集中于室内环境。

Method: 提出了一种生成户外任务无关度量语义点云的方法，并改进了现有室内3DSG生成技术以适应户外场景。

Result: 初步定性结果表明户外3DSGs的可行性，并展示了其在真实世界机器人应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: 户外3DSGs有望提升机器人在复杂环境中的上下文感知决策和自适应规划能力。

Abstract: High-level autonomous operations depend on a robot's ability to construct a
sufficiently expressive model of its environment. Traditional three-dimensional
(3D) scene representations, such as point clouds and occupancy grids, provide
detailed geometric information but lack the structured, semantic organization
needed for high-level reasoning. 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) address this
limitation by integrating geometric, topological, and semantic relationships
into a multi-level graph-based representation. By capturing hierarchical
abstractions of objects and spatial layouts, 3DSGs enable robots to reason
about environments in a structured manner, improving context-aware
decision-making and adaptive planning. Although most recent work has focused on
indoor 3DSGs, this paper investigates their construction and utility in outdoor
environments. We present a method for generating a task-agnostic
metric-semantic point cloud for large outdoor settings and propose
modifications to existing indoor 3DSG generation techniques for outdoor
applicability. Our preliminary qualitative results demonstrate the feasibility
of outdoor 3DSGs and highlight their potential for future deployment in
real-world field robotic applications.

Motivation: 机器人系统在现实环境中常因多样化和非结构化场景而失败，手动分析大规模失败数据不切实际，需自动化方法。

Result: 语义聚类揭示了潜在失败模式和原因，可用于指导策略优化和在线失败检测，提升机器人学习和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架将现实失败转化为可操作的信号，加速机器人策略迭代改进和实时适应。

Abstract: As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into real-world
environments, ranging from autonomous vehicles to household assistants, they
inevitably encounter diverse and unstructured scenarios that lead to failures.
While such failures pose safety and reliability challenges, they also provide
rich perceptual data for improving future performance. However, manually
analyzing large-scale failure datasets is impractical. In this work, we present
a method for automatically organizing large-scale robotic failure data into
semantically meaningful clusters, enabling scalable learning from failure
without human supervision. Our approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), trained on internet-scale data, to
infer high-level failure causes from raw perceptual trajectories and discover
interpretable structure within uncurated failure logs. These semantic clusters
reveal latent patterns and hypothesized causes of failure, enabling scalable
learning from experience. We demonstrate that the discovered failure modes can
guide targeted data collection for policy refinement, accelerating iterative
improvement in agent policies and overall safety. Additionally, we show that
these semantic clusters can be employed for online failure detection, offering
a lightweight yet powerful safeguard for real-time adaptation. We demonstrate
that this framework enhances robot learning and robustness by transforming
real-world failures into actionable and interpretable signals for adaptation.

Conclusion: 该工作为动态环境下的水下多机器人运动规划开发与测试提供了支持。

Abstract: Deploying multi-robot systems in underwater environments is expensive and
lengthy; testing algorithms and software in simulation improves development by
decoupling software and hardware. However, this requires a simulation framework
that closely resembles the real-world. Angler is an open-source framework that
simulates low-level communication protocols for an onboard autopilot, such as
ArduSub, providing a framework that is close to reality, but unfortunately
lacking support for simulating multiple robots. We present an extension to
Angler that supports multi-robot simulation and motion planning. Our extension
has a modular architecture that creates non-conflicting communication channels
between Gazebo, ArduSub Software-in-the-Loop (SITL), and MAVROS to operate
multiple robots simultaneously in the same environment. Our multi-robot motion
planning module interfaces with cascaded controllers via a JointTrajectory
controller in ROS~2. We also provide an integration with the Open Motion
Planning Library (OMPL), a collision avoidance module, and tools for procedural
environment generation. Our work enables the development and benchmarking of
underwater multi-robot motion planning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Accurate classification of lower limb movements using surface
electromyography (sEMG) signals plays a crucial role in assistive robotics and
rehabilitation systems. In this study, we present a lightweight attention-based
deep neural network (DNN) for real-time movement classification using
multi-channel sEMG data from the publicly available BASAN dataset. The proposed
model consists of only 62,876 parameters and is designed without the need for
computationally expensive preprocessing, making it suitable for real-time
deployment. We employed a leave-oneout validation strategy to ensure
generalizability across subjects, and evaluated the model on three movement
classes: walking, standing with knee flexion, and sitting with knee extension.
The network achieved 86.74% accuracy on the validation set and 85.38% on the
test set, demonstrating strong classification performance under realistic
conditions. Comparative analysis with existing models in the literature
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach, especially in
scenarios where computational cost and real-time response are critical. The
results indicate that the proposed model is a promising candidate for
integration into upper-level controllers in human-robot interaction systems.

TL;DR: ATENA是一种测试时主动学习框架，通过人类-机器人交互优化导航策略，减少预测不确定性并提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线训练的视觉语言导航策略在陌生环境中性能下降，传统熵最小化方法可能因错误累积而失效。

Method: 提出混合熵优化和自我主动学习策略，结合动作和伪专家分布优化不确定性校准。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中表现优异，成功克服测试时的分布偏移。

Conclusion: ATENA通过主动学习和不确定性校准，显著提升了导航策略的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) policies trained on offline datasets often
exhibit degraded task performance when deployed in unfamiliar navigation
environments at test time, where agents are typically evaluated without access
to external interaction or feedback. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
practical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however,
it can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in
incorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time
active learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via
episodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns
to increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones,
improving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy
optimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and
pseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the
agent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence
and action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy
that enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident
predictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all
iterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive
evaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate
that ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time,
outperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.

Motivation: 解决视频生成模型在未见任务上泛化能力不足的问题，并探索如何通过在线自我改进提升性能。

Method: 提出SAIL框架，利用互联网规模预训练视频模型和自收集轨迹数据迭代更新模型。

Result: 在MetaWorld任务和真实机器人任务中，SAIL持续提升性能，且对数据过滤和初始演示质量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAIL通过在线自我改进和互联网规模数据适应，为机器人任务提供了一种高效视频模型提升方法。

Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized
as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks.
However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved
generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from
additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video
datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can
continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this
work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an
in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories,
collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and
steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply
SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks
on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge
over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original
in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is
surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is
filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through
adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online
experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a
high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through
self-improvement.

Result: 在NAVSIM v1和v2中分别达到93.5% PDMS和87.1% EPDMS，表现出卓越的安全性和轨迹质量。

Conclusion: DriveSuprim在安全性和性能上优于现有方法，适用于复杂驾驶场景。

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely.
Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually
does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory.
Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple
trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face
optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands
of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences,
especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to
overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based
augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and
a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS
in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical
capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while
maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

Motivation: 现有轨迹评分方法在泛化能力上存在显著不足，静态方法缺乏细粒度适应性，动态方法难以捕捉广泛轨迹分布。

Method: GTRS包含三个创新：扩散式轨迹生成器、词汇泛化技术和传感器增强策略。

Result: GTRS在Navsim v2挑战赛中表现优异，接近依赖真实感知的基准方法。

Conclusion: GTRS通过结合粗粒度和细粒度评估，显著提升了轨迹评分的泛化能力。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous
driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key
component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal
trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on
scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically
generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization.
Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to
make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision
but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified
framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and
fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary
innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse
fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a
scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its
robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy
that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement
training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the
Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with
sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on
ground-truth perception. Code will be available at

Method: 提出了RoboCerebra基准测试，包括大规模模拟数据集、分层框架（VLM规划器和VLA控制器）和结构化评估协议。

Result: RoboCerebra在任务序列长度和注释密度上优于现有基准，并测试了VLMs作为System 2模块的性能。

Conclusion: RoboCerebra推动了更强大和通用的机器人规划器的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled
instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However,
most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs'
strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2
capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under
explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for
evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation.
RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task
horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a
hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level
vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol
targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2
interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT
generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human
operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality
trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks,
RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser
annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and
analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the
development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

Abstract: Dual-arm robots play a crucial role in improving efficiency and flexibility
in complex multitasking scenarios. While existing methods have achieved
promising results in task planning, they often fail to fully optimize task
parallelism, limiting the potential of dual-arm collaboration. To address this
issue, we propose RoboPARA, a novel large language model (LLM)-driven framework
for dual-arm task parallelism planning. RoboPARA employs a two-stage process:
(1) Dependency Graph-based Planning Candidates Generation, which constructs
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies and eliminate
redundancy, and (2) Graph Re-Traversal-based Dual-Arm Parallel Planning, which
optimizes DAG traversal to maximize parallelism while maintaining task
coherence. In addition, we introduce the Cross-Scenario Dual-Arm Parallel Task
dataset (X-DAPT dataset), the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate
dual-arm task parallelism across diverse scenarios and difficulty levels.
Extensive experiments on the X-DAPT dataset demonstrate that RoboPARA
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and
reliability, particularly in complex task combinations. The code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a
challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for
this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and
precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental
challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately
predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic
planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature
of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it
particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in
fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present
SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation
learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two
key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a
spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in
ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties
such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module
that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system
harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,
combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory
correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target
area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous
state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant
performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated
tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic
control in high-speed dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人应用中的3D场景理解提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, with
direct implications for downstream tasks such as navigation and manipulation.
Traditional approaches often rely on closed-set recognition or loop closure,
limiting their adaptability in open-world environments. With the advent of
visual foundation models (VFMs), open-vocabulary recognition and natural
language querying have become feasible, unlocking new possibilities for 3D
scene graph construction.
  In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient framework for instance-level
3D scene graph construction via LiDAR-camera fusion. Leveraging LiDAR's wide
field of view (FOV) and long-range sensing capabilities, we rapidly acquire
room-level geometric priors. Multi-level VFMs are employed to improve the
accuracy and consistency of semantic extraction. During instance fusion,
room-based segmentation enables parallel processing, while the integration of
geometric and semantic cues significantly enhances fusion accuracy and
robustness. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves up to
an order-of-magnitude improvement in construction speed while maintaining high
semantic precision.
  Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments validate
the effectiveness of our approach. We further demonstrate its practical value
through a language-guided semantic navigation task, highlighting its potential
for real-world robotic applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实时轨迹规划方法，结合RF源追踪和自适应人工势场（APF），用于无人机在未知环境中的导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有障碍物避障算法（如APF）无法适应不同障碍物配置的环境，且目标位置可能不精确，如搜救任务中。

Method: 通过采样方法实时调整APF参数，仅利用目标的方位角（通过RF信号计算），无需精确位置。

Result: 仿真结果显示，RF源追踪算法平均角度误差仅1.48度，导航算法成功率达到目标提升46%，轨迹长度减少1.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法在未知环境中显著提升了无人机导航的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Navigation of UAVs in unknown environments with obstacles is essential for
applications in disaster response and infrastructure monitoring. However,
existing obstacle avoidance algorithms, such as Artificial Potential Field
(APF) are unable to generalize across environments with different obstacle
configurations. Furthermore, the precise location of the final target may not
be available in applications such as search and rescue, in which case
approaches such as RF source seeking can be used to align towards the target
location. This paper proposes a real-time trajectory planning method, which
involves real-time adaptation of APF through a sampling-based approach. The
proposed approach utilizes only the bearing angle of the target without its
precise location, and adjusts the potential field parameters according to the
environment with new obstacle configurations in real time. The main
contributions of the article are i) an RF source seeking algorithm to provide a
bearing angle estimate using RF signal calculations based on antenna placement,
and ii) a modified APF for adaptable collision avoidance in changing
environments, which are evaluated separately in the simulation software Gazebo,
using ROS2 for communication. Simulation results show that the RF
source-seeking algorithm achieves high accuracy, with an average angular error
of just 1.48 degrees, and with this estimate, the proposed navigation algorithm
improves the success rate of reaching the target by 46% and reduces the
trajectory length by 1.2% compared to standard potential fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在协作任务中的意图是多层次且动态变化的，机器人需要准确跟踪这些意图以适配变化并纠正错误估计。

Method: HIT算法通过贝叶斯滤波、向上测量传播和向下后验传播，以任意深度的意图树表示人类意图。

Result: HIT系统在协作装配任务中优于现有方案，平衡了效率、工作量和舒适度，同时增强了用户信任。

Conclusion: HIT算法有效提升了协作机器人对多层次人类意图的理解能力，优化了用户体验和任务完成效果。

Abstract: During collaborative tasks, human behavior is guided by multiple levels of
intentions that evolve over time, such as task sequence preferences and
interaction strategies. To adapt to these changing preferences and promptly
correct any inaccurate estimations, collaborative robots must accurately track
these dynamic human intentions in real time. We propose a Hierarchical
Intention Tracking (HIT) algorithm for collaborative robots to track dynamic
and hierarchical human intentions effectively in real time. HIT represents
human intentions as intention trees with arbitrary depth, and probabilistically
tracks human intentions by Bayesian filtering, upward measurement propagation,
and downward posterior propagation across all levels. We develop a HIT-based
robotic system that dynamically switches between Interaction-Task and
Verification-Task trees for a collaborative assembly task, allowing the robot
to effectively coordinate human intentions at three levels: task-level (subtask
goal locations), interaction-level (mode of engagement with the robot), and
verification-level (confirming or correcting intention recognition). Our user
study shows that our HIT-based collaborative robot system surpasses existing
collaborative robot solutions by achieving a balance between efficiency,
physical workload, and user comfort while ensuring safety and task completion.
Post-experiment surveys further reveal that the HIT-based system enhances the
user trust and minimizes interruptions to user's task flow through its
effective understanding of human intentions across multiple levels.

Motivation: 利用先验知识提升机器人学习效率，但需解决知识相关性和适应性整合的挑战。

Result: 在模拟和真实实验中，CARoL表现出更快收敛和更高奖励。

Conclusion: CARoL能高效学习新任务，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn new robotic tasks from scratch is
often inefficient. Leveraging prior knowledge has the potential to
significantly enhance learning efficiency, which, however, raises two critical
challenges: how to determine the relevancy of existing knowledge and how to
adaptively integrate them into learning a new task. In this paper, we propose
Context-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to
efficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL
incorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system
dynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge. It
then utilizes these identified similarities to prioritize and adapt specific
knowledge pieces for the new task. Additionally, CARoL has a broad
applicability spanning policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL
algorithms. We validate the efficiency and generalizability of CARoL on both
simulated robotic platforms and physical ground vehicles. The simulations
include CarRacing and LunarLander environments, where CARoL demonstrates faster
convergence and higher rewards when learning policies for new tasks. In
real-world experiments, we show that CARoL enables a ground vehicle to quickly
and efficiently adapt policies learned in simulation to smoothly traverse
real-world off-road terrain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于传感器数据估算碰撞风险的方法，通过模拟场景评估冲突类型、角色分配和行为预期，预测碰撞严重性，并在合成环境中验证其准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够准确估算自动驾驶系统（ADS）或自然驾驶数据中碰撞风险的方法，以评估和改进ADS的安全性。

Method: 通过检测和分类冲突类型、识别角色（发起者或响应者）、建模行为预期为概率性反事实轨迹，结合速度差和碰撞模型估算碰撞严重性。

Result: 方法在合成环境中预测的碰撞与实际碰撞误差在1%以内；ADS软件版本将自然碰撞风险降低了4倍，分数碰撞风险降低了约62%。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效评估ADS的碰撞风险，并在实际测试中显著降低碰撞风险，证明了其实用性和准确性。

Abstract: We present a methodology for estimating collision risk from counterfactual
simulated scenarios built on sensor data from automated driving systems (ADS)
or naturalistic driving databases. Two-agent conflicts are assessed by
detecting and classifying conflict type, identifying the agents' roles
(initiator or responder), identifying the point of reaction of the responder,
and modeling their human behavioral expectations as probabilistic
counterfactual trajectories. The states are used to compute velocity
differentials at collision, which when combined with crash models, estimates
severity of loss in terms of probabilistic injury or property damage,
henceforth called fractional collisions. The probabilistic models may also be
extended to include other uncertainties associated with the simulation,
features, and agents. We verify the effectiveness of the methodology in a
synthetic simulation environment using reconstructed trajectories from 300+
collision and near-collision scenes sourced from VTTI's SHRP2 database and
Nexar dashboard camera data. Our methodology predicted fractional collisions
within 1% of ground truth collisions. We then evaluate agent-initiated
collision risk of an arbitrary ADS software release by replacing the
naturalistic responder in these synthetic reconstructions with an ADS simulator
and comparing the outcome to human-response outcomes. Our ADS reduced
naturalistic collisions by 4x and fractional collision risk by ~62%. The
framework's utility is also demonstrated on 250k miles of proprietary,
open-loop sensor data collected on ADS test vehicles, re-simulated with an
arbitrary ADS software release. The ADS initiated conflicts that caused 0.4
injury-causing and 1.7 property-damaging fractional collisions, and the ADS
improved collision risk in 96% of the agent-initiated conflicts.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）指导几何任务与运动规划（G-TAMP）问题的方法，通过结合LLM的常识推理和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）提高规划效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统G-TAMP方法依赖启发式或学习经验，计算成本高；而人类常利用常识直觉解决问题，因此尝试用LLM的常识知识辅助规划。

Method: 设计基于谓词的提示，将几何信息编码后输入LLM生成任务计划，再用MCTS搜索可行参数，避免直接依赖LLM输出。

Result: 在六个G-TAMP问题上，该方法优于传统LLM规划器和纯搜索算法。

Conclusion: 结合LLM和MCTS的方法能有效提升G-TAMP问题的解决效率，减少计算资源需求。

Abstract: The problem of relocating a set of objects to designated areas amidst movable
obstacles can be framed as a Geometric Task and Motion Planning (G-TAMP)
problem, a subclass of task and motion planning (TAMP). Traditional approaches
to G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning
from planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand
significant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use
common sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP
problems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),
which have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide
task planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric
reasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric
information derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to
generate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of
continuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing
to LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action
space and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that
calls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to
warm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.
On six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM
planners and pure search algorithms. Code can be found at:

Conclusion: ReLIC展示了在多样化任务中灵活协调肢体的能力，为机器人自主操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability to flexibly leverage limbs for loco-manipulation is essential for
enabling autonomous robots to operate in unstructured environments. Yet, prior
work on loco-manipulation is often constrained to specific tasks or
predetermined limb configurations. In this work, we present Reinforcement
Learning for Interlimb Coordination (ReLIC), an approach that enables versatile
loco-manipulation through flexible interlimb coordination. The key to our
approach is an adaptive controller that seamlessly bridges the execution of
manipulation motions and the generation of stable gaits based on task demands.
Through the interplay between two controller modules, ReLIC dynamically assigns
each limb for manipulation or locomotion and robustly coordinates them to
achieve the task success. Using efficient reinforcement learning in simulation,
ReLIC learns to perform stable gaits in accordance with the manipulation goals
in the real world. To solve diverse and complex tasks, we further propose to
interface the learned controller with different types of task specifications,
including target trajectories, contact points, and natural language
instructions. Evaluated on 12 real-world tasks that require diverse and complex
coordination patterns, ReLIC demonstrates its versatility and robustness by
achieving a success rate of 78.9% on average. Videos and code can be found at

Conclusion: HAPO方法有效提升了VLA模型的可靠部署和从失败中学习的能力。

Abstract: Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential
for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic
deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial
capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this
limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method
named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective
adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with
a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and
interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These
human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action
preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure
action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically,
we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of
irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing
preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from
binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these
modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures
reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The
experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior
generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation
tasks.

Abstract: Datasets pertaining to autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold significant promise for
a range of research fields, including artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous
driving, and transportation engineering. Nonetheless, these datasets often
encounter challenges related to the states of traffic signals, such as missing
or inaccurate data. Such issues can compromise the reliability of the datasets
and adversely affect the performance of models developed using them. This
research introduces a fully automated approach designed to tackle these issues
by utilizing available vehicle trajectory data alongside knowledge from the
transportation domain to effectively impute and rectify traffic signal
information within the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). The proposed method is
robust and flexible, capable of handling diverse intersection geometries and
traffic signal configurations in real-world scenarios. Comprehensive
validations have been conducted on the entire WOMD, focusing on over 360,000
relevant scenarios involving traffic signals, out of a total of 530,000
real-world driving scenarios. In the original dataset, 71.7% of traffic signal
states are either missing or unknown, all of which were successfully imputed by
our proposed method. Furthermore, in the absence of ground-truth signal states,
the accuracy of our approach is evaluated based on the rate of red-light
violations among vehicle trajectories. Results show that our method reduces the
estimated red-light running rate from 15.7% in the original data to 2.9%,
thereby demonstrating its efficacy in rectifying data inaccuracies. This paper
significantly enhances the quality of AV datasets, contributing to the wider AI
and AV research communities and benefiting various downstream applications. The

Abstract: This paper presents a novel morphing quadrotor, named MorphoCopter, covering
its design, modeling, control, and experimental tests. It features a unique
single rotary joint that enables rapid transformation into an ultra-narrow
profile. Although quadrotors have seen widespread adoption in applications such
as cinematography, agriculture, and disaster management with increasingly
sophisticated control systems, their hardware configurations have remained
largely unchanged, limiting their capabilities in certain environments. Our
design addresses this by enabling the hardware configuration to change on the
fly when required. In standard flight mode, the MorphoCopter adopts an X
configuration, functioning as a traditional quadcopter, but can quickly fold
into a stacked bicopters arrangement or any configuration in between. Existing
morphing designs often sacrifice controllability in compact configurations or
rely on complex multi-joint systems. Moreover, our design achieves a greater
width reduction than any existing solution. We develop a new inertia and
control-action aware adaptive control system that maintains robust performance
across all rotary-joint configurations. The prototype can reduce its width from
447 mm to 138 mm (nearly 70\% reduction) in just a few seconds. We validated
the MorphoCopter through rigorous simulations and a comprehensive series of
flight experiments, including robustness tests, trajectory tracking, and
narrow-gap passing tests.

Abstract: Self-localization is an important technology for automating bulldozers.
Conventional bulldozer self-localization systems rely on RTK-GNSS (Real Time
Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite Systems). However, RTK-GNSS signals are
sometimes lost in certain mining conditions. Therefore, self-localization
methods that do not depend on RTK-GNSS are required. In this paper, we propose
a machine learning-based self-localization method for bulldozers. The proposed
method consists of two steps: estimating local velocities using a machine
learning model from internal sensors, and incorporating these estimates into an
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for global localization. We also created a novel
dataset for bulldozer odometry and conducted experiments across various driving
scenarios, including slalom, excavation, and driving on slopes. The result
demonstrated that the proposed self-localization method suppressed the
accumulation of position errors compared to kinematics-based methods,
especially when slip occurred. Furthermore, this study showed that
bulldozer-specific sensors, such as blade position sensors and hydraulic
pressure sensors, contributed to improving self-localization accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents the modeling, design, and experimental validation of an
Ellipse-based Segmented Varying Curvature (ESVC) foot for bipedal robots.
Inspired by the segmented curvature rollover shape of human feet, the ESVC foot
aims to enhance gait energy efficiency while maintaining analytical
tractability for foot location based controller. First, we derive a complete
analytical contact model for the ESVC foot by formulating spatial
transformations of elliptical segments only using elementary functions. Then a
nonlinear programming approach is engaged to determine optimal elliptical
parameters of hind foot and fore foot based on a known mid-foot. An error
compensation method is introduced to address approximation inaccuracies in
rollover length calculation. The proposed ESVC foot is then integrated with a
Hybrid Linear Inverted Pendulum model-based walking controller and validated
through both simulation and physical experiments on the TT II biped robot.
Experimental results across marking time, sagittal, and lateral walking tasks
show that the ESVC foot consistently reduces energy consumption compared to
line, and flat feet, with up to 18.52\% improvement in lateral walking. These
findings demonstrate that the ESVC foot provides a practical and
energy-efficient alternative for real-world bipedal locomotion. The proposed
design methodology also lays a foundation for data-driven foot shape

TL;DR: 将MPPI控制器与CBF结合，通过CBF条件指导MPPI的控制采样，提升安全性和采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MPPI在无约束最优控制问题中缺乏严格不等式约束的问题，同时提升其在安全集边界附近的性能。

Method: 将CBF条件转化为等式约束，通过参数化线性类K函数处理，并设计成本函数增强安全性。引入状态变换和控制投影操作以满足约束。

Result: 仿真和四旋翼实验表明，该方法比传统MPPI具有更高的采样效率和更接近安全集边界的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效整合了MPPI和CBF，显著提升了控制性能和安全操作能力。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller is used to solve
unconstrained optimal control problems and Control Barrier Function (CBF) is a
tool to impose strict inequality constraints, a.k.a, barrier constraints. In
this work, we propose an integration of these two methods that employ CBF-like
conditions to guide the control sampling procedure of MPPI. CBFs provide an
inequality constraint restricting the rate of change of barrier functions by a
classK function of the barrier itself. We instead impose the CBF condition as
an equality constraint by choosing a parametric linear classK function and
treating this parameter as a state in an augmented system. The time derivative
of this parameter acts as an additional control input that is designed by MPPI.
A cost function is further designed to reignite Nagumo's theorem at the
boundary of the safe set by promoting specific values of classK parameter to
enforce safety. Our problem formulation results in an MPPI subject to multiple
state and control-dependent equality constraints which are non-trivial to
satisfy with randomly sampled control inputs. We therefore also introduce state
transformations and control projection operations, inspired by the literature
on path planning for manifolds, to resolve the aforementioned issue. We show
empirically through simulations and experiments on quadrotor that our proposed
algorithm exhibits better sampled efficiency and enhanced capability to operate
closer to the safe set boundary over vanilla MPPI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种实时分块（RTC）算法，用于解决现代AI系统在高频控制任务中的延迟问题，通过异步执行动作分块策略实现平滑操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统在物理世界交互中需要实时性能，但现有通用模型的高延迟问题导致动作分块边界出现停顿或不连贯动作。

Method: RTC算法无需重新训练，适用于任何基于扩散或流的视觉语言动作模型，通过在执行当前动作分块时生成下一个分块，实现平滑异步执行。

Result: 在12个高动态任务和6个真实世界双手机器人任务中，RTC显著提高了任务吞吐量和成功率，尤其在存在延迟的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: RTC是一种高效、性能优越且对延迟鲁棒的方法，适用于需要高精度和实时性的任务。

Abstract: Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world,
increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of
state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action
models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled
temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address
the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements
at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that
enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method,
real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out
of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while
executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and
"inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly
dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging
real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast,
performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving
task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks
$\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the
presence of significant latency. See

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMoD领域的快速发展导致标准化评估和报告实践的缺失，影响了研究的可重复性和科学进展。

Method: 通过系统分析AMoD研究流程中的关键组件（如系统建模、控制问题、仿真设计等），识别不可重复性的常见来源，并提出结构化框架和检查表。

Conclusion: 本文为智能出行系统的设计和部署奠定了更透明和可重复的研究文化基础，其原则可推广至其他依赖网络化自主性和数据驱动控制的网络物理系统。

Abstract: Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, powered by advances in
robotics, control, and Machine Learning (ML), offer a promising paradigm for
future urban transportation. AMoD offers fast and personalized travel services
by leveraging centralized control of autonomous vehicle fleets to optimize
operations and enhance service performance. However, the rapid growth of this
field has outpaced the development of standardized practices for evaluating and
reporting results, leading to significant challenges in reproducibility. As
AMoD control algorithms become increasingly complex and data-driven, a lack of
transparency in modeling assumptions, experimental setups, and algorithmic
implementation hinders scientific progress and undermines confidence in the
results. This paper presents a systematic study of reproducibility in AMoD
research. We identify key components across the research pipeline, spanning
system modeling, control problems, simulation design, algorithm specification,
and evaluation, and analyze common sources of irreproducibility. We survey
prevalent practices in the literature, highlight gaps, and propose a structured
framework to assess and improve reproducibility. Specifically, concrete
guidelines are offered, along with a "reproducibility checklist", to support
future work in achieving replicable, comparable, and extensible results. While
focused on AMoD, the principles and practices we advocate generalize to a
broader class of cyber-physical systems that rely on networked autonomy and
data-driven control. This work aims to lay the foundation for a more
transparent and reproducible research culture in the design and deployment of
intelligent mobility systems.

Motivation: 现有方法难以实时生成未观测区域且泛化能力差，需解决稀疏、不平衡的语义分布问题。

Method: 使用BitVAE编码语义图为比特令牌，结合掩码变换器推断缺失区域，并引入对象感知掩码策略。

Result: 在Gibson基准测试中，MapBERT实现了最先进的语义图生成，平衡了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: MapBERT通过比特编码和对象感知策略，有效建模室内语义分布，适用于实际机器人任务。

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables
them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge
arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by
sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing
methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not
generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT},
a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen
spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps
aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first
time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact
bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer
missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.
To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking
strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with
learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object
embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more
effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical
robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves
state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency
with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi-robot system that integrates mapping,
localization, and task and motion planning (TAMP) enabled by 3D scene graphs to
execute complex instructions expressed in natural language. Our system builds a
shared 3D scene graph incorporating an open-set object-based map, which is
leveraged for multi-robot 3D scene graph fusion. This representation supports
real-time, view-invariant relocalization (via the object-based map) and
planning (via the 3D scene graph), allowing a team of robots to reason about
their surroundings and execute complex tasks. Additionally, we introduce a
planning approach that translates operator intent into Planning Domain
Definition Language (PDDL) goals using a Large Language Model (LLM) by
leveraging context from the shared 3D scene graph and robot capabilities. We
provide an experimental assessment of the performance of our system on
real-world tasks in large-scale, outdoor environments.

Conclusion: RAPID Hand是一个低成本、高性能的平台，适合高质量数据收集，并将公开以促进可重复性和广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper addresses the scarcity of low-cost but high-dexterity platforms
for collecting real-world multi-fingered robot manipulation data towards
generalist robot autonomy. To achieve it, we propose the RAPID Hand, a
co-optimized hardware and software platform where the compact 20-DoF hand,
robust whole-hand perception, and high-DoF teleoperation interface are jointly
designed. Specifically, RAPID Hand adopts a compact and practical hand ontology
and a hardware-level perception framework that stably integrates wrist-mounted
vision, fingertip tactile sensing, and proprioception with sub-7 ms latency and
spatial alignment. Collecting high-quality demonstrations on high-DoF hands is
challenging, as existing teleoperation methods struggle with precision and
stability on complex multi-fingered systems. We address this by co-optimizing
hand design, perception integration, and teleoperation interface through a
universal actuation scheme, custom perception electronics, and two retargeting
constraints. We evaluate the platform's hardware, perception, and teleoperation
interface. Training a diffusion policy on collected data shows superior
performance over prior works, validating the system's capability for reliable,
high-quality data collection. The platform is constructed from low-cost and
off-the-shelf components and will be made public to ensure reproducibility and
ease of adoption.

Conclusion: BitVLA展示了在内存受限边缘设备上部署的潜力，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across
a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size
poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic
systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the
inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss,
its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present
BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every
parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint
of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that
compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,
a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent
representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA
achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with
4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only
29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on
memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in

Conclusion: 研究为多智能体系统中的人类行为建模提供了数据支持，并强调了透明度和用户特征在信任交互中的重要性。

Abstract: Current robotic agents, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and drones, need to
deal with uncertain real-world environments with appropriate situational
awareness (SA), risk awareness, coordination, and decision-making. The SymAware
project strives to address this issue by designing an architecture for
artificial awareness in multi-agent systems, enabling safe collaboration of
autonomous vehicles and drones. However, these agents will also need to
interact with human users (drivers, pedestrians, drone operators), which in
turn requires an understanding of how to model the human in the interaction
scenario, and how to foster trust and transparency between the agent and the
human.
  In this work, we aim to create a data-driven model of a human driver to be
integrated into our SA architecture, grounding our research in the principles
of trustworthy human-agent interaction. To collect the data necessary for
creating the model, we conducted a large-scale user-centered study on human-AV
interaction, in which we investigate the interaction between the AV's
transparency and the users' behavior.
  The contributions of this paper are twofold: First, we illustrate in detail
our human-AV study and its findings, and second we present the resulting Markov
chain models of the human driver computed from the study's data. Our results
show that depending on the AV's transparency, the scenario's environment, and
the users' demographics, we can obtain significant differences in the model's
transitions.

Conclusion: Fast ECoT无需模型修改或额外训练，适用于现有VLA系统，推动ECoT实时部署。

Abstract: Embodied Chain-of-Thought (ECoT) reasoning enhances vision-language-action
(VLA) models by improving performance and interpretability through intermediate
reasoning steps. However, its sequential autoregressive token generation
introduces significant inference latency, limiting real-time deployment. We
propose Fast ECoT, an inference-time acceleration method that exploits the
structured and repetitive nature of ECoT to (1) cache and reuse high-level
reasoning across timesteps and (2) parallelise the generation of modular
reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous scheduler that
decouples reasoning from action decoding, further boosting responsiveness. Fast
ECoT requires no model changes or additional training and integrates easily
into existing VLA pipelines. Experiments in both simulation (LIBERO) and
real-world robot tasks show up to a 7.5% reduction in latency with comparable
or improved task success rate and reasoning faithfulness, bringing ECoT
policies closer to practical real-time deployment.

Conclusion: 该平台能系统评估云控智能网联车辆在不同测试条件下的表现，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Testing cloud-controlled intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) requires
simulation environments that faithfully emulate both vehicle behavior and
realistic communication latencies. This paper proposes a latency-aware
co-simulation platform integrating CarMaker and Vissim to evaluate safety and
comfort under real-world vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) latency conditions. Two
communication latency models, derived from empirical 5G measurements in China
and Hungary, are incorporated and statistically modeled using Gamma
distributions. A proactive conflict module (PCM) is proposed to dynamically
control background vehicles and generate safety-critical scenarios. The
platform is validated through experiments involving an exemplary system under
test (SUT) across six testing conditions combining two PCM modes
(enabled/disabled) and three latency conditions (none, China, Hungary). Safety
and comfort are assessed using metrics including collision rate, distance
headway, post-encroachment time, and the spectral characteristics of
longitudinal acceleration. Results show that the PCM effectively increases
driving environment criticality, while V2C latency primarily affects ride
comfort. These findings confirm the platform's effectiveness in systematically
evaluating cloud-controlled ICVs under diverse testing conditions.

Motivation: 传统MPC方法在解决腿式机器人运动控制问题时计算复杂度高，难以满足实时性需求。本文旨在通过GPU并行化降低计算复杂度。

Method: 采用并行关联扫描技术求解原始-对偶KKT系统，实现时间和状态空间的并行化，将计算复杂度从O(N(n+m)^3)降至O(nlogN + m)。

Conclusion: 该方法通过GPU并行化显著提升了MPC的计算效率，支持大规模并行化，为机器人运动控制提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) implementation
for legged robot locomotion that leverages GPU parallelization. Our approach
enables both temporal and state-space parallelization by incorporating a
parallel associative scan to solve the primal-dual Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
system. In this way, the optimal control problem is solved in
$\mathcal{O}(n\log{N} + m)$ complexity, instead of $\mathcal{O}(N(n + m)^3)$,
where $n$, $m$, and $N$ are the dimension of the system state, control vector,
and the length of the prediction horizon. We demonstrate the advantages of this
implementation over two state-of-the-art solvers (acados and crocoddyl),
achieving up to a 60\% improvement in runtime for Whole Body Dynamics (WB)-MPC
and a 700\% improvement for Single Rigid Body Dynamics (SRBD)-MPC when varying
the prediction horizon length. The presented formulation scales efficiently
with the problem state dimensions as well, enabling the definition of a
centralized controller for up to 16 legged robots that can be computed in less
than 25 ms. Furthermore, thanks to the JAX implementation, the solver supports
large-scale parallelization across multiple environments, allowing the
possibility of performing learning with the MPC in the loop directly in GPU.

Conclusion: BridgeVLA通过统一输入和输出空间，有效提升了3D操作学习的效率和性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to
effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D
signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the
spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In
this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D
inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,
and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and
output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a
scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability
to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments
show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and
effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across
three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate
from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better
performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average
success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing
baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,
BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It
generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual
disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a
success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,
highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency. Project

Motivation: 解决未知系统和扰动模型下的鲁棒输出调节问题，仅依赖有限时间序列数据。

Conclusion: 数值示例验证了方法的有效性，为数据驱动的鲁棒控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper a solution of the data-driven robust output regulation problem
for linear parabolic systems is presented. Both the system as well as the ODE,
i.e., the disturbance model, describing the disturbances are unknown, but
finite-time sequential data obtained from measurements of the output to be
controlled and additional boundary outputs are available. The data-driven
controller is designed in the Koopman operator framework for PDEs, where the
Koopman modes and eigenvalues are obtained from data using Hankel-DMD. It is
shown that all system parameters and the eigenvalues of the disturbance model
can be recovered from the available measurements by solving an inverse
Sturm-Liouville problem. This allows to directly apply backstepping methods for
the robust regulator design. For this, closed-loop stability in the presence of
small errors in the Hankel-DMD is verified in the nominal case. Robust output
regulation is shown for non-destabilizing model uncertainties. A numerical
example demonstrates the results of the paper.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，用于优化Power-to-Gas（P2G）系统的长期经济运营，解决了延迟奖励问题，并通过改进算法提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: P2G技术在整合可再生能源方面具有潜力，但其运营成本高且效率低，且现有研究多关注短期能源转换，忽略了长期存储能力。

Method: 通过三个逐步复杂的案例研究，评估了Deep Q-Networks和Proximal Policy Optimization算法，并引入预测整合、奖励惩罚和战略成本计算等改进。

Result: 改进后的DRL显著提升了P2G系统的成本效益运营能力，解决了延迟奖励问题，释放了其长期储能潜力。

Conclusion: DRL结合改进方法为P2G系统的长期经济运营提供了有效解决方案，推动了其在可再生能源整合中的应用。

Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration
of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids.
However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is
complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and
loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing
energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of
converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of
energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face
difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.
Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the
energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of
P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be
applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and
gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex
case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep
Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to
enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,
implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost
calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our
findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex
decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose
significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation
strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G
technologies.

Abstract: 6G networks have become increasingly complicated due to novel network
architecture and newly emerging signal processing and transmission techniques,
leading to significant burdens to 6G network management. Large language models
(LLMs) have recently been considered a promising technique to equip 6G networks
with AI-native intelligence. Different from most existing studies that only
consider a single LLM, this work involves a multi-LLM debate-based scheme for
6G network management, where multiple LLMs can collaboratively improve the
initial solution sequentially. Considering the complex nature of 6G domain, we
propose a novel hierarchical debate scheme: LLMs will first debate the sub-task
decomposition, and then debate each subtask step-by-step. Such a hierarchical
approach can significantly reduce the overall debate difficulty by sub-task
decomposition, aligning well with the complex nature of 6G networks and
ensuring the final solution qualities. In addition, to better evaluate the
proposed technique, we have defined a novel dataset named 6GPlan, including 110
complex 6G network management tasks and 5000 keyword solutions. Finally, the
experiments show that the proposed hierarchical debate can significantly
improve performance compared to baseline techniques, e.g. more than 30%
coverage rate and global recall rate improvement.

Abstract: Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant potential for addressing
complex nonlinear control problems. For real-world safety-critical tasks,
however, it is crucial to provide formal stability guarantees for the designed
controllers. In this paper, we propose a new framework for designing neural
controllers that achieve both stability and optimality with respect to certain
functions. Our key idea is to exploit the concept of input-output dissipativity
of nonlinear systems by learning neural storage functions and supply rate
functions. As a generalization of Lyapunov theory, dissipativity theory
provides a natural connection to optimal control theory, offering both
stability guarantees and meaningful optimality certificates. The neural
controllers can be directly derived from the learned supply rate functions and
guarantee closed-loop stability while inheriting optimality properties that can
be shaped towards user-defined control objectives. Extensive numerical
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: With electric power infrastructure increasingly susceptible to impacts from
climate-driven natural disasters, there is an increasing need for optimization
algorithms that determine where to harden the power grid. Prior work has
primarily developed optimal hardening approaches for specific acute disaster
scenarios. Given the extensive costs of hardening the grid, it is important to
understand how a particular set of resilience investments will perform under
multiple types of natural hazards. Using a large-scale test case representing
the Texas power system, this paper aims to understand how line undergrounding
investment decisions made for wildfire ignition risk mitigation perform during
a range of wildfire, hurricane, and wind events. Given the varying geographical
spread and damage profile of these events, we show that investment decisions
made to address one type of natural disaster do not necessarily improve broader
resilience outcomes, supporting the need for co-optimization across a range of
hazards.

of planning and operational studies, especially for multi-scenario and
probabilistic studies, as well as for screening studies to establish impact
zones based on the dynamic interactions between inverters and synchronous

Conclusion: 提出的概率框架和迭代优化方法为计算CRAS提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the computation of controlled reach-avoid sets (CRASs)
for discrete-time polynomial systems subject to control inputs. A CRAS is a set
encompassing initial states from which there exist control inputs driving the
system into a target set while avoiding unsafe sets. However, efficiently
computing CRASs remains an open problem, especially for discrete-time systems.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework for computing CRASs which takes
advantage of a probabilistic perspective. This framework transforms the
fundamentally nonlinear problem of computing CRASs into a computationally
tractable convex optimization problem. By regarding control inputs as
disturbances obeying certain probability distributions, a CRAS can be
equivalently treated as a 0-reach-avoid set in the probabilistic sense, which
consists of initial states from which the probability of eventually entering
the target set while remaining within the safe set is greater than zero. Thus,
we can employ the convex optimization method of computing 0-reach-avoid sets to
estimate CRASs. Furthermore, inspired by the $\epsilon$-greedy strategy widely
used in reinforcement learning, we propose an approach that iteratively updates
the aforementioned probability distributions imposed on control inputs to
compute larger CRASs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
on extensive examples.

Abstract: With electric power infrastructure posing an increasing risk of igniting
wildfires under continuing climate change, utilities are frequently
de-energizing power lines to mitigate wildfire ignition risk, which can cause
load shedding. Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage
systems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load
shedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit
substantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery
installation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple
possible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for
optimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while
considering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of
uncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire
ignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of
scenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well
as the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we
decompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition
approach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer
linear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes
of batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage
consists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line
undergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on a large-scale transmission network with
real world data on wildfire ignition risks, load, and renewable generation.

Abstract: This paper presents adaptive event-triggered formation control strategies for
autonomous vehicles (AVs) subject to longitudinal and lateral motion
uncertainties. The proposed framework explores various vehicular formations to
enable safe and efficient navigation in complex traffic scenarios, such as
narrow passages, collaborative obstacle avoidance, and adaptation to cut-in
maneuvers. In contrast to conventional platoon control strategies that rely on
predefined communication topologies and continuous state transmission, our
approach employs a sampling-based observer to reconstruct vehicle dynamics.
Building upon an adaptive backstepping continuous-time controller, we design
three distinct event-triggered mechanisms, each offering a different trade-off
between formation tracking performance and control efficiency by reducing the
frequency of control signal updates. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is
conducted to guarantee bounded tracking errors and to avoid Zeno behavior.
Finally, the proposed event-triggered controllers are validated through
simulations of vehicular formation in three scenarios, highlighting their
impact on traffic safety and mobility.

Abstract: With multi-agent systems increasingly deployed autonomously at scale in
complex environments, ensuring safety of the data-driven policies is critical.
Control Barrier Functions have emerged as an effective tool for enforcing
safety constraints, yet existing learning-based methods often lack in
scalability, generalization and sampling efficiency as they overlook inherent
geometric structures of the system. To address this gap, we introduce
symmetries-infused distributed Control Barrier Functions, enforcing the
satisfaction of intrinsic symmetries on learnable graph-based safety
certificates. We theoretically motivate the need for equivariant
parametrization of CBFs and policies, and propose a simple, yet efficient and
adaptable methodology for constructing such equivariant group-modular networks
via the compatible group actions. This approach encodes safety constraints in a
distributed data-efficient manner, enabling zero-shot generalization to larger
and denser swarms. Through extensive simulations on multi-robot navigation
tasks, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of safety, scalability, and task success rates, highlighting the
importance of embedding symmetries in safe distributed neural policies.

Abstract: Green buildings (GBs) with renewable energy and building energy management

Electric vehicles (EVs), as flexible storage resources, enhance system
flexibility when integrated with stationary energy storage systems (ESS) for
real-time scheduling. However, differing degradation and operational
characteristics of ESS and EVs complicate scheduling strategies. This paper
proposes a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for joint

EV travel demands, and enable collaborative ESS-EV operation under varying

BEMS. To address heterogeneous states, action coupling, and learning
efficiency, the DRL algorithm incorporates double networks, a dueling

Conclusion: 提出的框架解决了无模型CBFs中衰减率未知的问题，通过数据驱动方法增强了安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for enabling safe velocity control of general
robotic systems using data-driven model-free Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
Model-free CBFs rely on an exponentially stable velocity controller and a
design parameter (e.g. alpha in CBFs); this design parameter depends on the
exponential decay rate of the controller. However, in practice, the decay rate
is often unavailable, making it non-trivial to use model-free CBFs, as it
requires manual tuning for alpha. To address this, a Neural Network is used to
learn the Lyapunov function from data, and the maximum decay rate of the
systems built-in velocity controller is subsequently estimated. Furthermore, to
integrate the estimated decay rate with model-free CBFs, we derive a
probabilistic safety condition that incorporates a confidence bound on the
violation rate of the exponential stability condition, using Chernoff bound.
This enhances robustness against uncertainties in stability violations. The
proposed framework has been tested on a UR5e robot in multiple experimental
settings, and its effectiveness in ensuring safe velocity control with
model-free CBFs has been demonstrated.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for
port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition
based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two
parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow
handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a
dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties.
A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two
components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,
determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for
providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This
hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the
system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via
LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability
through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state
attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning
hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved
state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to
address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$
formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller
architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness
analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical
investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is
simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits
for future research.

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary materials testing, the demand for scalability,
adaptability, parallelism, and speed has surged due to the proliferation of
diverse materials and testing standards. Traditional controller-based systems
often fall short in meeting these requirements, resulting in adaptability and
processing speed limitations. Conversely, FPGA-based controllers present a
multifaceted, high-performance solution. Key advantages of FPGA-based
controllers in materials testing encompass reconfiguration capabilities for
cost-effective adaptation to evolving materials and standards. FPGAs also
enable the integration of parallel control and data acquisition circuits, vital
for multichannel test equipment demanding simultaneous, independent operation
of multiple control channels.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多智能体系统中的安全性问题，具有实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge,
particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this
work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time
multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier
functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on
centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk
operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a
distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative
strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a
known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility
can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly
conservative.

Result: 闭环信号在攻击下有界，输出共识误差在有限时间内收敛到可调残差集。

Conclusion: 所提控制器优于现有方法，仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies distributed resilient consensus problem for a class of
uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems susceptible to deception attacks. The
attacks invade both sensor and actuator channels of each agent. A specific
class of Nussbaum functions is adopted to manage the attack-incurred multiple
unknown control directions. Additionally, a general form of these Nussbaum
functions is provided, which helps to ease the degeneration of output
performance caused by Nussbaum gains. Then, by introducing finite-time
distributed reference systems and local-error-based dynamic gains, we propose a
novel distributed adaptive backstepping-based resilient consensus control
strategy. We prove that all the closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded under
attacks, and output consensus errors converge in finite time to a
clearly-defined residual set whose size can be reduced by tuning control
parameters, which is superior to existing results. Simulation results display
the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

Abstract: Operando impedance measurements are promising for monitoring batteries in the
field. In this work, we present pseudo-random sequences for low-cost operando
battery impedance measurements. The quadratic-residue ternary sequence and
direct-synthesis ternary sequence exhibit specific properties related to
eigenvectors of the discrete Fourier transform matrix that allow
computationally efficient compensation for drifts and transients in operando
impedance measurements. We describe the application of pseudo-random sequences
and provide the data processing required to suppress drift and transients,
validated on simulations. Finally, we perform experimental operando impedance
measurements on a Li-ion battery cell during fast-charging, demonstrating the
applicability of the proposed method. It's low-cost hardware requirements, fast
measurements, and simple data-processing make the method practical for
embedding in battery management systems.

Abstract: This letter describes a 40.68 MHz wireless power transfer receiver for
implantable applications focused on minimizing tissue heating. The system
features a novel power radiated efficiency optimization strategy and a
fast-settling active rectifier that maintains high efficiency during load and
link variations required for downlink communication. The power radiated
efficiency optimization explicitly reduces tissue heating while enabling
transmitter-side load monitoring for closed-loop control. The active rectifier
was fabricated in 40nm CMOS and achieves a voltage conversion ratio of 93.9%
and a simulated power conversion efficiency of 90.1% in a 0.19 $mm^2$ area,
resulting in a 118 mW/$mm^2$ power density while integrating the resonance and
filter capacitors. The worst-case settling of the on- and off-delay
compensation in the active rectifier is 200 ns, which is the fastest reported
to date.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of underwater acoustic source tracking and
pursuit with a team of autonomous underwater vehicles. Producing distributed
control strategies in an underwater sensor network is not trivial since
communication is primarily acoustic, which makes it intermittent and often
plagued with major difficulties. For this reason, we propose an optimization
scheme based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process for improving
the performance of underwater mobile sensor networks, in which autonomous
underwater vehicles (agents) play the role of moving nodes of a network. The
key idea is to adjust the agents' guidance strategies to achieve coordinated
motion planning, enabling optimal geometric configurations between the agents
and the target to enhance tracking performance. Such a problem is cast as a
multi-objective optimization problem that is solved through a receding horizon
lookahead optimization scheme since we are interested in long-term tracking
accuracy. The planning strategy is distributed using the sequential multi-agent
decision-making paradigm to make the solving tractable since the optimization
depends on the joint action domain. A distributed control framework has been
implemented in a simulation environment to validate the proposed approach,
which explicitly accounts for the major limitations imposed by acoustic
communications.
