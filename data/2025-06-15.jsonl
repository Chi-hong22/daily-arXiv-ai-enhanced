While per-garment virtual try-on methods\nhave tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training\nper-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)\nthe robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively\nexpensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural\nhuman body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the\nhuman body.

This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,\nblack-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can\nbe highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require\nsignificant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address\nthese challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We\ninterpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to\nuse a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.\nThis novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both\nthe model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also\nincorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.\nTo perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data\nmodalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a\nnovel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt\noptimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey\nmodification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively\non closed-source models.

The strategy is trained\nfrom real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain\nand finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation\nperformed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted\nto include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on\ncontainers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The\nevaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,\nand object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain\npretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of\nfinetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over\nmultiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining\nthe relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,\nonly a subset of them can be used as input."}

Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy\nto capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While\ngoal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on\nin-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to\ntasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial\ngeneralization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of\ntemporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally\nrelated states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the\nout-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,\nencouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should\nfacilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which\nencode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely\nencapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor\nrepresentations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)\nlearning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective\nrepresentation learning objective, $\\text{BYOL-}\\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which\nis not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in\nthe finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,\nresults in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging\ntasks requiring combinatorial generalization."}

This assumption limits robustness and\ngeneralization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous,\nirrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional\nMAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen\nexecutable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we\nconstruct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective\ninstructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,\nsafety, and out-of-context.

Earlier methods rely on dense\nBEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse\nquery-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries\nand can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,\nwe propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic\nqueries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to\nsequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to\nencourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence\ninformation, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked\nreconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an\ninformative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space\nlearned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and\nsplit operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries\nthroughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection\nperformance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,\nDySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the\nart. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a\nreal-time inference speed of 33 FPS."}

While traditional methods like the Beran estimator\noffer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data\nstructures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival\nmodels, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood\nfunctions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of\nlikelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the\nJoint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention\nmechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first\nidea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued\nprobability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events\nmoments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson\nregression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise\nprobability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third\nidea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to\nthe proposed three models.

Accurate state\nestimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor\nmapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences\nwhen sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an\nInvariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate\npartial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on\nrelative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily\nobserve a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to\nestimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides\nyaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these\nmeasurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating\nsuch partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF\nimplementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly\nrelevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a \"seafaring plane.\" This\npaper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based\nroll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state\nestimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full\norientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF).

RKM is\nan extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a\nnetwork to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after\nwhich a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation\nthat aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM\noutputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we\nleverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that\nencodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates.

The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups.

Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue.

To mirror real-life\nscenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and\nclasses, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple\nlevels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance\nrecognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we\nidentify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To\nmodel these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual\nlearning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited\nfor hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with\nlow distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic\nclassification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of\nhierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,\nwe introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on\nEgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical\nobject recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show\nthat HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved\nhierarchical generalization."}

To address these issues, we\nintroduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and\npromoting message passing within the network's forward pass.

We conduct extensive experiments on\nImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and\nSpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Specifically, we achieve\nreal-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the\nmatrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU\nreadings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption\nreduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides\ndiverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for\naccurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in\nreal time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS\nmatrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based\nmodel. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU\nreadings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To\nour knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,\nseamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration\nprocess), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture\nusing sparse IMUs.

Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated\nstrong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free\nguidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods\nlack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be\napplied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where\nquality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer\nlevel down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads\ngovern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for\niteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,\nenabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In\naddition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected\nhead's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to\ntune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only\nmitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but\nalso enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through\ncompositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale\nDiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,\ndemonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and\nstyle-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of\nattention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable\nspecialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of\neffective perturbation strategies."}

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method\nachieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the\nbaseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to\nsignificantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of\nsignal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion\nof analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research\nand clinical applications.

The method approximates the\nposterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses\nthis to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for\nexponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the\nmethod is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing\nbaselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion\nmodels, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the\nlatent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We\ndemonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within\nindividual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the\ndiffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the\nlatent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of\ndiffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase\ntransitions.

Training-free methods like diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic\nalgorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,\ne.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques\nveer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,\nwe devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism\nand reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\\hat{x}$\nproduced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the\nsolution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting\nfrom $\\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for\nDPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box\nin-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art\nbaselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these\nbaselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We\ncomplement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data\ndistributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the\ncandidate solution closer to the data manifold.

We\ndevelop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings\nand train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We\naccomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a\n360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports\nrendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze\non top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the\nhand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye\nobservations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct\naction predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks\ntowards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements\na foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small\ncompute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable\nfixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.\nWe evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring\nmanipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm.
