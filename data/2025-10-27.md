### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training的新方法，通过在适配器训练期间为混淆因素建立辅助模块，防止目标属性与偶然因素（如姿势、表情、光照）的纠缠，从而提高生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的适配器训练方法在从单张图像中学习目标属性时，容易将目标属性与图像中的其他视觉因素（如姿势、表情、光照）纠缠在一起，这种虚假相关性限制了模型的泛化能力并阻碍了文本提示的遵循。

Method: 在适配器训练期间，为混淆因素建立辅助模块（如ControlNet或LoRA），让这些因素通过这些模块处理，从而消除适配器内部化这些因素的动机。在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入等任务中，该方法显著提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 当寻求解耦表示时，最有效的路径可能是为不应该学习的内容建立捷径，这为大型模型时代提供了一个通用的设计原则。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [ArtiLatent: Realistic Articulated 3D Object Generation via Structured Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21432)
*Honghua Chen,Yushi Lan,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtiLatent是一个生成框架，能够合成具有精细几何结构、准确关节运动和真实外观的人造3D物体。该方法通过变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间，并使用潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在合成具有关节结构的3D物体时，难以同时保证几何一致性、关节运动准确性和外观真实性，特别是在处理关节相关的可见性变化时存在挑战。

Method: 1. 使用变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间；2. 在潜在空间上训练扩散模型进行多样化采样；3. 引入关节感知的高斯解码器，考虑关节相关的可见性变化；4. 基于关节状态调节外观解码，为通常被遮挡的区域分配合理的纹理特征。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法，能够生成具有物理合理性的多样化3D物体。

Conclusion: ArtiLatent为关节化3D物体的合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了跨关节配置的视觉真实感。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [3] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 提出了一种新的视频生成范式，通过参考视频作为语义提示，利用冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer和插件式Mixture-of-Transformers专家实现统一、可泛化的语义控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的关键挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: VAP将问题重新定义为上下文生成，使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer和插件式Mixture-of-Transformers专家架构，结合时间偏置位置嵌入来消除虚假映射先验。

Result: VAP作为单一统一模型，在开源方法中达到最先进水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美。

Conclusion: VAP的强零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持，标志着向通用可控视频生成的重大进展。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [4] [Group Inertial Poser: Multi-Person Pose and Global Translation from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21654)
*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用稀疏可穿戴IMU和UWB测距技术来估计多人全身运动和全局轨迹的新方法，通过融合惯性观测和传感器间距离信息来提高跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于IMU的运动跟踪虽然克服了视觉方法的遮挡和环境限制，但缺乏空间参考导致平移估计不准确和多人相对定位困难。

Method: 使用IMU+UWB传感器，通过结构化状态空间模型融合惯性观测和传感器间绝对距离，采用两步优化方法估计身体姿态和全局轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上评估，该方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进方法，并创建了首个IMU+UWB双人跟踪数据集。

Conclusion: IMU+UWB组合在野外多人运动捕捉中展现出良好前景，为多人交互场景提供了有效的跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

### [5] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，使用焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，提升医学图像分割的边界精度和对病变变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕捉全局上下文信息和长程依赖关系，影响对复杂边界和不同大小结构的精确分割。

Method: 结合CNN和Transformer架构，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器和解码器跨尺度表示的高效交互。

Result: 在8个公开数据集（包括息肉检测、皮肤病变分割和超声成像）上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过有效结合CNN和Transformer的优势，在多种医学成像场景中展现出优异的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [6] [WorldGrow: Generating Infinite 3D World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21682)
*Sikuang Li,Chen Yang,Jiemin Fang,Taoran Yi,Jia Lu,Jiazhong Cen,Lingxi Xie,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个用于无限扩展3D场景合成的分层框架，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，解决了现有方法在几何一致性、可扩展性和场景级生成方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在跨视图的几何和外观不一致性，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型大多为物体中心，限制了场景级生成的适用性。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：(1)数据整理流程提取高质量场景块用于训练；(2)3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；(3)从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了其构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，以及构建未来世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

### [7] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GenPT，一种生成式点轨迹跟踪框架，能够建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的判别式模型在存在不确定性时只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉多模态。为了解决这一限制，需要开发能够建模多模态轨迹的生成式框架。

Method: GenPT采用流匹配训练框架，结合判别式跟踪器的迭代优化、跨窗口一致性的窗口依赖先验，以及专门为点坐标调整的方差调度。推理时使用最佳优先搜索策略在生成样本上进行轨迹估计。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中评估，GenPT在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进精度，同时在可见点上保持与现有判别式点跟踪器相当的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: GenPT能够捕捉点轨迹中的多模态特性，这转化为在遮挡点上的最先进跟踪精度，同时保持可见点的竞争性跟踪精度。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出EH-YOLOv11n模型，通过小样本学习实现胎盘超声图像中血肿特征的自动检测，检测准确率达78%，比YOLOv11n提升2.5%，比YOLOv8提升13.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎盘早剥是妊娠期严重并发症，传统超声诊断方法依赖医师经验，存在主观偏差和诊断不一致性问题，需要自动准确的检测方法。

Method: 基于小样本学习的EH-YOLOv11n模型，集成小波卷积和坐标卷积增强频率和空间特征提取，引入级联组注意力机制抑制超声伪影和遮挡干扰，提高边界框定位精度。

Result: 检测准确率达到78%，在精确率-召回率曲线、置信度分数和遮挡场景下均表现出显著优势，兼具高精度和实时处理能力。

Conclusion: 该模型为胎盘早剥的计算机辅助诊断提供了可靠解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

### [9] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3DReasonKnee数据集，这是首个用于医学图像的3D接地推理数据集，包含494k个高质量五元组，用于评估视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中的解剖区域定位和逐步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中难以准确定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这与临床医生的实际诊断流程不符。现有3D数据集缺乏支持这种"接地推理"能力。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包含：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤、结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估基准，对五种最先进的视觉语言模型进行了基准测试，为3D医学图像中的定位和诊断准确性提供了基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的资源库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的局部决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用热偏振线索进行详细3D形状重建的新方法，该方法独立于光照和材质特性，通过多视角热偏振图像有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法受光照和材质特性限制，无法有效处理透明、半透明和异质物体。热偏振成像能够避免可见光偏振分析中的模糊性问题。

Method: 建立了偏振观测的一般理论，证明长波红外偏振成像不受可见光偏振模糊性影响，提出使用多视角热偏振图像恢复详细3D形状的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材质的新途径，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的对象中心自监督适应方法，用于视觉基础模型的无标注域适应，通过多视角对象视频和自蒸馏范式实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺领域表现不佳的问题，传统监督微调不可行，而现有的自监督学习方法对视觉编码器模型效果有限。

Method: 使用多视角对象中心视频进行自监督微调，采用自蒸馏范式，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术，防止模型遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: VESSA提供了一种有效的无标注视觉基础模型适应方法，能够从多视角对象观察中学习对变化捕获条件的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

### [12] [Foley Control: Aligning a Frozen Latent Text-to-Audio Model to Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21581)
*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练的单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型交叉注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型能力的同时，实现高效的多模态协调。

Method: 连接V-JEPA2视频嵌入到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本交叉注意力后插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力，通过视频token池化减少内存需求。

Result: 在精选的视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现竞争力，可训练参数远少于最近的多模态系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和生产友好的模块化。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的多模态协调解决方案，虽然专注于视频到Foley，但相同的桥接设计可以扩展到其他音频模态（如语音）。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何定位，为下游机器人应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveSeg是一种新颖的语义分割解码器架构，通过在空间域和小波域联合优化特征细化，利用小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，在保持语义完整性的同时增强高频结构细节。

Method: 提出WaveSeg解码器：1）从小波域学习高频分量作为显式先验；2）双域操作（DDO）进行多尺度融合；3）频谱分解注意力（SDA）块利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模；4）重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5）残差引导融合整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性评估中都持续优于最先进的方法，实现了高效精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过小波域频率先验与基于Mamba的注意力机制，成功解决了语义分割中语义上下文与细节保存的权衡问题，为语义分割任务提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在Hirschsprung病诊断中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式，需要更符合临床实践的方法。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练(CLIP)基础模型，集成专家来源的文本概念，通过大型语言模型生成提示词，经团队审核后使用QuiltNet编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识可产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Conclusion: HistRetinex模型通过直方图域的扩展，实现了快速高效的低光照图像增强，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了处理速度。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM主要在静态、完全可观察环境中研究视觉推理，而现实世界信息往往因遮挡或视野限制而不完整。受人类主动探索环境能力的启发，需要开发能够主动获取信息的推理系统。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR仿真基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，包含丰富的思维链标注。开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型，在马尔可夫决策过程中实现不确定性识别、信息增益预测和最大化信息获取的动作选择。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA, RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath, Geometry30K)上达到最先进性能。分析发现当前具身MLLM虽能检测信息不完整性，但难以通过交互主动获取和整合新信息。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是MLLM发展的关键方向，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让AI系统像人类一样主动探索环境来获取信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视点不匹配敏感，基于点或体素的方法需要大内存、假设完美预对齐、忽略类别一致性关联，无法处理分割合并情况且忽略不确定性。

Method: 多分辨率NDT和点面ICP对齐，高度归一化，基于配准协方差和表面粗糙度计算检测水平，几何代理种子跨时期关联，语义和实例分割细化，类约束二分图分配处理分割合并，分块处理限制内存。

Result: 在15个Subiaco区块上达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，比Triplet KPConv在准确率、mF1和mIoU上分别提升0.2、0.2和0.8个百分点，在Decreased类别上IoU达到74.8%，提升7.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在城市尺度LiDAR变化检测中表现出色，特别是在处理分割合并情况和不确定性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE通过动态先验调制实现高效微调，在保持高性能的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object

TL;DR: SafetyPairs是一个可扩展框架，通过生成仅在与安全策略相关特征上不同的反事实图像对，来系统研究图像安全性的微妙差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集过于粗糙模糊，仅提供宽泛的安全标签，无法隔离驱动安全差异的具体特征。需要系统区分良性图像和问题图像，因为细微变化（如侮辱性手势或符号）会极大改变图像的安全含义。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，仅改变影响安全标签的特征，同时保持安全无关细节不变，从而生成反事实图像对。

Result: 构建了包含3,020个SafetyPair图像的基准数据集，涵盖9个安全类别，揭示了视觉语言模型在区分细微差异图像方面的弱点，并可作为有效的数据增强策略提高轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs提供了首个系统研究细粒度图像安全差异的资源，既能作为评估基准暴露模型弱点，又能通过数据增强提升防护模型性能。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性噪声注入和贝叶斯建模，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的推理泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成数字对比CTPA，显著改善血管增强效果，特别是在小血管方面，为无对比剂CTPA诊断提供了可行方案

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

### [26] [Towards Physics-informed Spatial Intelligence with Human Priors: An Autonomous Driving Pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21160)
*Guanlin Wu,Boyan Su,Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Yichen Lin,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了空间智能网格(SIG)作为文本的补充通道，通过网格化结构显式编码物体布局和空间关系，用于评估和提升基础模型的空间智能能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估视觉空间智能的方法主要依赖文本提示和VQA式评分，这掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，并削弱了对真正空间技能的归因。

Method: 引入SIG结构化网格模式，构建SIG-informed评估指标，在少样本情境学习中测试多模态LLM，并发布SIGBench基准数据集。

Result: SIG在所有VSI指标上相比纯VQA表示获得了更一致、更稳定和更全面的提升，表明其作为数据标注和训练模式的潜力。

Conclusion: SIG为学习视觉空间智能提供了有前景的数据标注和训练模式，并发布了包含1.4K驾驶帧的SIGBench基准数据集。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

*Dogyun Park,Taehoon Lee,Minseok Joo,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM)框架，通过将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专门的小型速度块建模，提高推理效率和样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的显著信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 采用分块设计，将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专门的速度块建模；引入语义特征引导模块，使速度块基于预训练表示的语义丰富特征；提出轻量级特征残差近似策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上的实验表明，BFM在保持相当生成性能的同时，实现了2.1倍到4.9倍的推理复杂度加速，建立了显著改进的Pareto前沿。

Conclusion: BFM框架通过分块设计和语义特征引导，有效解决了传统Flow Matching模型的局限性，在推理效率和生成质量方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专为夜间无人机跟踪设计的系统，通过多尺度层次融合、自适应关键令牌门和夜间模板校准器三个核心模块，解决了夜间跟踪中的特征一致性、复杂背景识别和长序列稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、复杂背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有方法存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和无法充分利用动态物体信息等问题。

Method: 提出MATrack系统，包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次融合增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的目标信息，夜间模板校准器确保长序列跟踪的稳定性。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，精确度、归一化精确度和AUC分别比最先进方法提升5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。

Conclusion: MATrack在真实无人机平台上验证了其可靠性，能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个基于CLIP的零样本异常检测框架，通过动态对齐视觉和可学习文本空间实现细粒度异常学习，解决了现有方法在单一文本空间中对齐多样对象和领域的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种无差别对齐阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 提出TokenCLIP框架，将标记无关的文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过最优传输问题动态分配每个视觉标记到语义相关的子空间组合，并使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性能。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态标记级对齐机制，有效提升了零样本异常检测的准确性和细粒度学习能力。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Motivation: 现有静态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估失真，需要更可靠的评估协议。

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过知识增强基准演化(KBE)框架，整合多模态知识，重构问题和扩展现有问题，实现难度可控评估。

Result: 实验表明KBE能缓解数据污染和饱和风险，提供更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: iSM框架系统性地解决了捷径模型的关键限制，使其成为可行且具有竞争力的生成模型类别，推动了非对抗生成建模的发展。

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

Motivation: 实现高精度token预测并支持并行生成，相比顺序自回归方法具有显著优势，通过同时观察所有网格token来提升效率和可控性。

Result: 在复杂数据集上的实验表明，TSSR能够生成高质量的3D艺术风格网格，达到10,000个面片和1024^3的空间分辨率。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略，在3D网格生成中实现了高质量和高效率的平衡，为艺术风格3D内容创作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，为视觉语言导航提供了更真实和实用的训练与评估平台。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率场景中处理极小型物体的挑战，在分割和推理任务上都取得了显著改进

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval评估套件通过高分辨率预测模拟，将形态、扰动和功能联系起来，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Result: 在公开苹果病害数据集和自建数据集上分别达到97.38%和96.12%的准确率，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，显著提升了复杂环境条件下的识别精度，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪方法主要强调速度而缺乏语义感知探索，导致在相机运动、快速运动和低分辨率等典型挑战下性能不佳。

Method: 使用动态语义相关性生成器结合Transformer的相关图来探索语义相关性，并设计了剪枝方法以提高跟踪速度。

Result: 在多个无人机跟踪数据集上实现了有竞争力的性能，提供了多种模型变体以在速度和精度之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无人机跟踪中的语义感知不足问题，提高了在复杂场景下的跟踪性能，同时支持灵活的部署选择。

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种注视正则化框架，仅使用注视信号进行训练，通过注视正则化注意力机制将模型注意力与人类视觉注视对齐，提升自我中心视觉语言模型在细粒度未来事件预测和当前活动理解任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类注视提供了关于注意力、短期意图和未来行动的有价值线索，是建模自我中心行为的强大信号。现有方法要么仅依赖视觉输入，要么将注视作为辅助输入信号，而本工作探索仅使用注视进行训练的方法。

Method: 提出注视正则化注意力机制，该机制在训练期间将模型注意力与人类视觉注视对齐。这种设计灵活且模块化，可泛化到多种使用注意力的VLM架构。

Result: 实验结果显示，与未使用注视正则化的基线模型相比，该方法在未来事件预测任务中语义预测分数提升高达11分，在当前活动理解任务中提升约7分。

Conclusion: 这项工作为使用人类注视增强VLM在现实场景（如辅助机器人和人机协作）中的预测能力奠定了基础，证明了注视引导训练在提高自我中心VLM准确性和鲁棒性方面的价值。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

### [42] [Why Registration Quality Matters: Enhancing sCT Synthesis with IMPACT-Based Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21358)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于从MRI和CBCT生成合成CT的统一管道，采用2.5D U-Net++架构，结合像素级L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。评估了两种配准策略，发现IMPACT配准能提供更准确的解剖对齐，但Elastix配准在验证集上得分更高，反映了配准偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更稳健和可泛化的sCT合成模型。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练和区域微调。损失函数结合L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。评估Elastix和IMPACT两种配准策略。

Result: 在本地测试集上，IMPACT配准实现了更准确的对齐和更低的MAE，但在公共验证集上，Elastix配准模型得分更高，显示出配准偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估。IMPACT配准有助于减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健的sCT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

### [43] [BADiff: Bandwidth Adaptive Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21366)
*Xi Zhang,Hanwei Zhu,Yan Zhong,Jiamang Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实时网络带宽约束的自适应扩散模型框架，通过端到端训练使模型能够根据可用带宽调整生成质量，实现早期停止采样以优化带宽受限环境下的图像传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用固定步数的去噪过程生成高保真图像，但在实际云到设备场景中，有限带宽往往需要重度压缩，导致精细纹理丢失和计算资源浪费。

Method: 引入联合端到端训练策略，扩散模型以从可用带宽推导的目标质量级别为条件，通过轻量级质量嵌入引导去噪轨迹，自适应调制去噪过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比简单早期停止方法，该方法显著提高了带宽自适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案，仅需最小的架构改动。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度一致性约束和优化策略，成功解决了图像拼接中的视差问题，实现了高效且高质量的图像拼接。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Method: 构建MUVR基准，支持视频中心的多模态查询（长文本描述、视频标签提示、掩码提示），采用一对多检索范式，定义多级视觉对应关系（复制、事件、场景、实例、动作等）。

Result: 对3种最先进的视频检索模型、6种基于图像的VLM和10种MLLM进行了广泛评估，揭示了这些方法在处理未剪辑视频和多模态查询时的局限性。

Conclusion: MUVR基准揭示了检索方法在处理未剪辑视频和多模态查询方面的不足，以及MLLM在多视频理解和重排序方面的限制，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

Motivation: 现有语言引导的视觉概念学习方法局限于少数预定义概念轴（如颜色、形状），且主要在合成数据集上探索，无法处理真实世界中丰富多样的语义维度。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化图像相关概念轴；通过通用概念编码器自适应绑定视觉特征到发现的概念轴；优化组合锚定目标确保各概念轴可独立操控。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ数据集上展示了优越的编辑能力，能够处理过于多样化而无法手动预定义的真实世界概念；表现出强大的组合泛化能力，优于现有视觉概念学习和基于文本的编辑方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为语言引导的视觉概念学习提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够自适应发现和操作真实世界中的多样化视觉概念，无需额外模型参数或预定义概念。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于图像恢复CNN的查找表实现方法，通过各向异性池化策略替代平均池化，在保持查找表尺寸可控的同时提升恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合各向异性信号结构，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入广义中值池化方法，并进一步扩展为学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，该各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能有效提升基于查找表的图像恢复CNN性能，为管理查找表尺寸与感受野平衡提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

TL;DR: OpenHype提出了一种使用连续双曲潜在空间表示3D场景层次结构的新方法，解决了现有方法在推理时间和泛化能力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建模3D对象和场景的层次结构对于自主代理的环境理解至关重要，但现有基于隐式表示的方法存在多渲染通道导致推理时间增加，或依赖预定义离散层次结构泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 利用双曲几何特性，在连续双曲潜在空间中表示场景层次结构，通过测地路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 在标准基准测试中优于最先进方法，展示了在3D场景理解方面更高的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: OpenHype通过连续双曲潜在空间有效解决了3D场景层次建模的挑战，为自主代理提供了更好的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频异常检测研究主要集中在离线场景，而在线VAD由于实时性约束和计算强度很少受到关注。本文旨在解决在线VAD的固有复杂性。

Method: 使用流式输入到VLMs，结合LSTM启发的预测机制来捕捉时间依赖关系，设计评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上的评估表明，MoniTor优于最先进方法，且无需训练即可与弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，通过结合预训练模型和时间建模机制，在实时场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且往往忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，以及上下文控制器模块编码一致性先验并注入I2V生成骨干网络。

Result: 广泛评估表明VidSplice在多样化视频修复场景中取得竞争性表现，显著改善了前景对齐和运动稳定性。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦策略和间隔帧先验有效解决了视频修复中的时空稳定性问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

*Yiming Tang,Wenjia Zhong,Rushi Shah,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC是一个基于语言的可解释胸部X光分类框架，通过任务对齐模式发现来提供透明、可验证的诊断解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中预测结果不透明的问题，为临床医生提供可信任的自动化诊断解释。

Method: 在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上训练基于转码器的稀疏自编码器，将医学图像表示分解为可解释的视觉模式，使用MIMIC-CXR数据集训练100个转码器集成模型。

Result: 发现了约5000个单语义模式，涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影等类别，在五个关键发现上达到竞争性诊断准确率。

Conclusion: 医学AI系统可以同时实现准确性和可解释性，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双流架构，通过整合组织层面特征和细胞层面特征来改进病理图像分析，特别针对癌症亚型分类等细粒度任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理基础模型主要关注全局组织上下文，但忽略了细胞级特征建模，这在细粒度任务如癌症亚型分类中是一个关键限制。

Method: 采用双流架构建模组织特征与细胞表示之间的相互作用；提出接受度加权的键值聚合模型，以线性复杂度捕获细胞间依赖关系；引入双向组织-细胞交互模块实现局部细胞线索与周围组织环境的相互关注。

Result: 在四个组织病理学亚型分类基准测试中，所提方法优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中发挥着关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Motivation: 针对封闭区域中多摄像头重叠视角下频繁发生的人员遮挡问题，需要开发专门的多目标跟踪方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出图加权解决方案，基于轨迹和人员特征在线更新身份标签，包含特征提取、跟踪和社区搜索等模块，并配备人员位置估计模块提供关键信息。

Result: 在封闭区域模型记录和满足高度拥挤空间要求的公开数据集上测试，显示该方法优于无位置数据的方法。

Conclusion: GRAP-MOT在拥挤封闭区域的多目标跟踪中表现优越，分析表明IDF1比MOTA更适合此类算法比较，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有视觉编码器专注于全局图像表示但忽视细粒度区域分析，由于缺乏细粒度标注数据和预训练范式，限制了在细粒度感知方面的能力。

Method: 构建Gran-29M数据集（200万图像，1.8亿区域级标注），采用预训练-适应框架和自蒸馏机制，通过边界框到标题回归和标题到边界框回归增强视觉表示和定位能力。

Result: GranViT在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解任务上达到最先进水平，超越了现有视觉编码器并展现出强大的迁移能力。

Conclusion: GranViT通过大规模细粒度预训练和区域级自回归训练，成功解决了视觉编码器在细粒度感知方面的局限性，在多模态任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一视角，将条件引导重新构建为定点迭代，并引入了前瞻引导（FSG）方法，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题以提高效率和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类器自由引导（CFG）方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择。需要统一的理论框架来理解和改进CFG的操作机制。

Method: 将条件引导重新构建为定点迭代问题，提出FSG方法在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题，增加迭代次数以提高效率。

Result: 在多种数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为条件引导提供了新的视角，并解锁了自适应设计的潜力，证明了FSG在扩散模型中的优越性能。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信号处理的方法来分析注意力头在语义和视觉属性上的专业化，发现仅编辑1%的注意力头就能可靠地抑制或增强目标概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言和视觉语言模型的内部机制，特别是注意力头在特定语义或视觉属性上的专业化，以更好地理解和控制大规模生成模型。

Method: 基于已有的可解释性方法，通过信号处理视角重新解释使用最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，分析多个样本并基于与目标概念的相关性对注意力头进行排序。

Result: 在单模态和多模态Transformer中都发现了注意力头级别的专业化一致模式，仅编辑1%的注意力头就能可靠地抑制或增强目标概念，在问答、毒性缓解、图像分类和字幕生成等任务上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 注意力层内存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Chunk-GRPO方法，将GRPO优化从步级提升到块级，解决了优势归因不准确和忽略生成时序动态的问题，在文本到图像生成中取得了更好的偏好对齐和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中表现出潜力，但面临两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略了生成的时序动态特性。

Method: 将连续步骤分组为连贯的'块'，捕捉流匹配的内在时序动态，在块级别优化策略，并引入可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景，能有效解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段文本图像引导超分辨率框架，通过"先文本后图像"范式解决生成式超分辨率方法在图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量和文本可读性之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架，明确将字形恢复与图像增强解耦：首先重建精确的文本结构，然后使用这些结构指导后续的全图像超分辨率。

Result: TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时显著提高了文本可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过字形到图像的引导机制，成功打破了图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡，为场景文本超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

TL;DR: 使用深度学习模型自动检测MEG记录中的发作间期棘波，提出两种神经网络架构并在59名患者数据上训练，通过交互式机器学习策略提高标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耐药性癫痫术前评估中，MEG检测发作间期棘波对定位致痫区很重要，但手动检测繁琐且易出错，现有自动化方法不适合临床实践。

Method: 提出基于特征的ANN和CNN两种模型架构，使用59名患者数据训练，采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者上均优于现有最优模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式学习证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构模型在分析复杂且标注不完美数据时具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习方法可加速数据标注，模型是有效的自动棘波检测工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测面临数据受限问题，像素级标注成本高昂，导致相关子任务需要单独训练模型。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道生成超过139,000张高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，通过迭代生成框架优先处理具有挑战性的类别，并设计流线型多掩码解码器处理检测中的固有模糊性。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现20-50%的错误减少，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构能有效解决显著目标检测中的数据受限问题，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限场景中，传统跨模态对齐模型（如CLIP）因数据质量差或相关性弱而导致的过度自信和性能下降问题。

Method: 采用两种互补策略：随机扰动（引入可控噪声模拟不确定性）和嵌入平滑（校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布），共同减少过度自信。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的检索任务中优于最先进方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就实现了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过成对极几何约束来改进视频扩散模型，解决几何不一致、不稳定运动和视觉伪影问题，使用基于偏好的优化方法直接处理不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成模型虽然在大型潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术方面取得了进展，但仍然存在几何不一致、不稳定运动和视觉伪影等问题，破坏了逼真3D场景的幻觉。3D一致的视频生成对生成和重建任务的下游应用具有重要影响。

Method: 采用基于偏好的优化方法，通过成对极几何约束来对齐扩散模型，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影问题。该方法高效地强制执行几何原则，不需要端到端的可微分性。在静态场景和动态相机上进行训练，确保高质量测量，同时模型能有效泛化到多样的动态内容。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，后者会产生噪声目标从而损害对齐质量。该方法在保持视觉质量的同时，能够生成空间一致的视频。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，在不损害视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Motivation: 解决不同领域点云数据规模有限的问题，同时避免混合领域预训练知识可能与下游任务不匹配导致性能下降的问题。

Method: 设计异构领域适配器（预训练时使用适应模式，微调时使用融合模式）和领域特征生成器，引导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 在单一预训练下，在四个不同点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能够有效整合跨领域点云数据知识，通过领域自适应机制提升点云分析任务的性能，解决了数据稀缺和领域不匹配问题。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN通过模拟认知发展过程，有效提升了知识蒸馏性能，为动态蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are

influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10

MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on

*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了长尾识别方法在野生动物物种识别中的应用，在NACTI数据集上通过优化LTR损失函数和正则化方法，将Top-1准确率从95.51%提升至99.40%，并在跨域测试中展示了更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然世界数据收集（如NACTI数据集）存在严重的类别不平衡问题，最大的'Head'类别占数据集的50%以上，需要专门的长尾识别方法来处理这种不平衡性。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究了多种长尾识别损失函数和LTR敏感正则化方法，构建了减少偏差的测试集来评估域偏移。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40% Top-1准确率，相比标准交叉熵的95.51%有显著提升；在跨域测试中准确率达到52.55%，优于WCE损失的51.20%。

Conclusion: LTR增强调度器选择与先进LTR损失函数结合能带来一致改进，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决严重域偏移下'Tail'类别的灾难性性能下降问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于邻近突触相似性的无监督方法，用于从EM图像中分离突触类型，无需预先知道类型数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要监督学习，而该方法仅利用同一神经元中邻近突触比随机选择的突触更相似的观察，无需先验知识即可分类突触。

Method: 基于邻近突触相似性假设，使用无监督方法对果蝇数据进行突触分类，不预设类型数量。

Result: 成功应用于果蝇数据，能够自动识别突触类型，无需预先指定类型数量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需监督的突触分类方式，并能系统性地选择覆盖所有突触结构的真实数据。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入，通过均值聚合策略汇总为玻片级特征，训练多种机器学习分类器。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归对Virchow2达到90%准确率，但差异无统计学意义。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化WSI分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Motivation: 解决生态学中因不信任黑盒神经网络模型而采用计算机视觉技术滞后的问题，通过后解释方法为预测提供证据并记录现场部署的重要限制。

Method: 使用Faster R-CNN检测海豹，并应用梯度类激活映射（HiResCAM、LayerCAM）、LIME和基于扰动的解释方法生成解释。

Result: 解释集中在海豹躯干和轮廓而非周围环境，移除海豹会降低检测置信度，揭示了海豹与黑冰和岩石混淆的系统性错误模式。

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后解释相结合，可以超越"黑盒"预测，开发出可审计的、支持决策的保护监测工具。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

TL;DR: BachVid是一种无需训练的方法，通过分析DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，实现多视频中角色和背景的一致性生成，无需参考图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在生成多个视频时难以保持角色和背景一致性的问题，现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只关注角色一致性。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些缓存变量注入到新生成视频的相应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明BachVid在无需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的鲁棒一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致性视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

TL;DR: 视觉扩散模型可作为几何求解器，通过像素空间直接解决几何问题，包括内接正方形问题、斯坦纳树问题和简单多边形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型在解决长期未解决的几何问题上的潜力，将几何推理重新定义为图像生成任务。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型将高斯噪声转换为表示有效近似解的图像，模型学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置。

Result: 模型能够生成与精确解密切匹配的有效近似解，成功应用于三个著名几何问题。

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作为解决复杂几何问题提供了通用实用框架，为处理更广泛几何任务打开了大门。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Conclusion: 自反思框架能有效检测视觉模型对特定视觉属性的依赖，为模型鲁棒性分析和改进提供了有力工具。

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法在复杂物理场景下的泛化能力和物理一致性存在局限，需要开发能够跨不同物理参数泛化的模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了弹塑性材料建模中的泛化和物理一致性问题，同时具备正向模拟和逆向参数估计的双重能力。

Abstract: While data-driven methods offer significant promise for modeling complex
materials, they often face challenges in generalizing across diverse physical
scenarios and maintaining physical consistency. To address these limitations,
we propose a generalizable framework called Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural
Constitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials, which combines the partial
differential equations with neural networks. Specifically, the model employs
two separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws.
Simultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional
inputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios
with varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across
different properties without requiring retraining for each individual case.
Furthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its
explicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical
parameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our
framework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties. Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in motion reconstruction,
robust long-term prediction, geometry generalization, and precise parameters
estimation for elastoplastic materials, highlighting its versatility as a
unified simulator and inverse analysis tool.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音频生成模型的快速发展，语音伪造等滥用风险增加，需要有效的水印技术来确保数字媒体真实性，但传统统计水印方法在音频模型中面临重标记化不匹配的挑战

Method: 使用聚类方法将同一簇内的标记视为等价，专门针对音频生成模型设计无失真水印技术Aligned-IS

Result: 在主流音频生成平台上测试显示，Aligned-IS在保持生成音频质量的同时，显著提高了水印检测能力，优于现有无失真水印方法

Conclusion: Aligned-IS为安全音频技术应用建立了新基准，有效解决了重标记化不匹配问题

Abstract: The rapid advancement of next-token-prediction models has led to widespread
adoption across modalities, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic media.
In the audio domain, while autoregressive speech models have propelled
conversational interactions forward, the potential for misuse, such as
impersonation in phishing schemes or crafting misleading speech recordings, has
also increased. Security measures such as watermarking have thus become
essential to ensuring the authenticity of digital media. Traditional
statistical watermarking methods used for autoregressive language models face
challenges when applied to autoregressive audio models, due to the inevitable
``retokenization mismatch'' - the discrepancy between original and retokenized
discrete audio token sequences. To address this, we introduce Aligned-IS, a
novel, distortion-free watermark, specifically crafted for audio generation
models. This technique utilizes a clustering approach that treats tokens within
the same cluster equivalently, effectively countering the retokenization
mismatch issue. Our comprehensive testing on prevalent audio generation
platforms demonstrates that Aligned-IS not only preserves the quality of
generated audio but also significantly improves the watermark detectability
compared to the state-of-the-art distortion-free watermarking adaptations,
establishing a new benchmark in secure audio technology applications.

Result: 生成了包含10万多个7阶Ambisonic RIR的数据集，提供了房间体积、RT60分布、吸声特性等统计信息，并与现有RIR集合进行了比较。

Conclusion: HiFi-HARP为复杂环境中的空间音频和声学算法开发提供了丰富资源，支持FOA到HOA上采样、声源定位、去混响等基准测试，以及空间音频渲染和声学参数估计等机器学习应用。

Abstract: We introduce HiFi-HARP, a large-scale dataset of 7th-order Higher-Order
Ambisonic Room Impulse Responses (HOA-RIRs) consisting of more than 100,000
RIRs generated via a hybrid acoustic simulation in realistic indoor scenes.
HiFi-HARP combines geometrically complex, furnished room models from the
3D-FRONT repository with a hybrid simulation pipeline: low-frequency wave-based
simulation (finite-difference time-domain) up to 900 Hz is used, while high
frequencies above 900 Hz are simulated using a ray-tracing approach. The
combined raw RIRs are encoded into the spherical-harmonic domain (AmbiX ACN)
for direct auralization. Our dataset extends prior work by providing 7th-order
Ambisonic RIRs that combine wave-theoretic accuracy with realistic room
content. We detail the generation pipeline (scene and material selection, array
design, hybrid simulation, ambisonic encoding) and provide dataset statistics
(room volumes, RT60 distributions, absorption properties). A comparison table
highlights the novelty of HiFi-HARP relative to existing RIR collections.
Finally, we outline potential benchmarks such as FOA-to-HOA upsampling, source
localization, and dereverberation. We discuss machine learning use cases
(spatial audio rendering, acoustic parameter estimation) and limitations (e.g.,
simulation approximations, static scenes). Overall, HiFi-HARP offers a rich
resource for developing spatial audio and acoustics algorithms in complex
environments.

Abstract: Speech separation and enhancement (SSE) has advanced remarkably and achieved
promising results in controlled settings, such as a fixed number of speakers
and a fixed array configuration. Towards a universal SSE system, single-channel
systems have been extended to deal with a variable number of speakers (i.e.,
outputs). Meanwhile, multi-channel systems accommodating various array
configurations (i.e., inputs) have been developed. However, these attempts have
been pursued separately. In this paper, we propose a flexible input and output
SSE system, named FlexIO. It performs conditional separation using prompt
vectors, one per speaker as a condition, allowing separation of an arbitrary
number of speakers. Multi-channel mixtures are processed together with the
prompt vectors via an array-agnostic channel communication mechanism. Our
experiments demonstrate that FlexIO successfully covers diverse conditions with
one to five microphones and one to three speakers. We also confirm the
robustness of FlexIO on CHiME-4 real data.

Smule Renaissance Small (SRS), a compact single-stage model that performs
end-to-end vocal restoration directly in the complex STFT domain. By
incorporating phase-aware losses, SRS enables large analysis windows for

Conclusion: 在流匹配中建模预测不确定性，结合音乐特定的音色一致性目标，为专业级实时演奏虚拟乐器提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Virtual instrument generation requires maintaining consistent timbre across
different pitches and velocities, a challenge that existing note-level models
struggle to address. We present FlowSynth, which combines distributional flow
matching (DFM) with test-time optimization for high-quality instrument
synthesis. Unlike standard flow matching that learns deterministic mappings,
DFM parameterizes the velocity field as a Gaussian distribution and optimizes
via negative log-likelihood, enabling the model to express uncertainty in its
predictions. This probabilistic formulation allows principled test-time search:
we sample multiple trajectories weighted by model confidence and select outputs
that maximize timbre consistency. FlowSynth outperforms the current
state-of-the-art TokenSynth baseline in both single-note quality and cross-note
consistency. Our approach demonstrates that modeling predictive uncertainty in
flow matching, combined with music-specific consistency objectives, provides an
effective path to professional-quality virtual instruments suitable for
real-time performance.

*Jingyue Huang,Qihui Yang,Fei Yueh Chen,Julian McAuley,Randal Leistikow,Perry R. Cook,Yongyi Zang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: StylePitcher是一个通用音高曲线生成器，通过参考音频学习歌手风格，同时保持与目标旋律的对齐，无需重新训练即可适应多种歌唱任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音高曲线生成器存在两个主要问题：忽略歌手特定的表现力，无法捕捉个人演唱风格；通常作为特定任务的辅助模块开发，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 基于整流流匹配架构，灵活结合符号乐谱和音高上下文作为生成条件，可以从参考音频中学习歌手风格。

Result: 在各种歌唱任务的客观和主观评估中，StylePitcher在保持与任务特定基线相当的音高准确性的同时，提高了风格相似性和音频质量。

Conclusion: StylePitcher作为一个通用音高曲线生成器，能够有效学习歌手风格并适应多种歌唱任务，在风格相似性和音频质量方面表现出色。

Abstract: Existing pitch curve generators face two main challenges: they often neglect
singer-specific expressiveness, reducing their ability to capture individual
singing styles. And they are typically developed as auxiliary modules for
specific tasks such as pitch correction, singing voice synthesis, or voice
conversion, which restricts their generalization capability. We propose
StylePitcher, a general-purpose pitch curve generator that learns singer style
from reference audio while preserving alignment with the intended melody. Built
upon a rectified flow matching architecture, StylePitcher flexibly incorporates
symbolic music scores and pitch context as conditions for generation, and can
seamlessly adapt to diverse singing tasks without retraining. Objective and
subjective evaluations across various singing tasks demonstrate that
StylePitcher improves style similarity and audio quality while maintaining
pitch accuracy comparable to task-specific baselines.

TL;DR: ROPES是一个基于分数因果表示学习的无监督机器人姿态估计框架，通过干预学习可控制的潜在变量，无需标注数据即可高保真地解耦生成因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果表示学习在理论和实际应用之间存在较大差距，本文旨在通过将CRL应用于机器人姿态估计这一具体领域来缩小这一差距。

Method: 提出ROPES框架，利用机器人自然产生的干预（通过控制关节执行器）来识别可操纵的潜在变量，基于分数因果表示学习方法。

Result: 在半合成机械臂实验中，ROPES成功高保真地解耦了潜在生成因素，仅利用分布变化而无需任何标注数据。

Conclusion: 机器人姿态估计可作为因果表示学习的接近实用的测试平台，为理论到实践的转化提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,
requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure
knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully
autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware.
We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying.
To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890
suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework
that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a
benchmark for dexterous imitation learning, we evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT,
and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.
Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in
surgery. These contributions support reproducible evaluation and development of
precision-focused, long-horizon dexterous manipulation policies necessary for

Result: 在挑战性机器人任务中，PPC提高了对未见相机姿态的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PPC为领域随机化提供了原则性替代方案，显著减少了视角引起的不一致性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Abstract: We introduce a novel system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that
enables robots to manipulate objects by learning from human demonstration
videos. The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data
collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from
the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video
understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand
trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand
trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The
last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory
in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory
transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a
robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile
manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed
differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation
tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our
system

Motivation: 解决长时程任务示教中的问题：偏差累积、分布偏移增加和教师疲劳，这些因素增加了失败几率。

Method: 提出(ST)^2顺序式学习方法，允许用户定义关键点进行分段示教。通过用户研究比较传统整体式方法和顺序式方法在补货任务中的表现。

Result: 两种方法在轨迹质量和成功率上表现相似。部分用户偏好顺序式方法的迭代控制，另一部分用户则更喜欢整体式方法的简单性。

Conclusion: 两种示教方法各有优势，用户偏好存在差异。顺序式方法提供了更好的控制，而整体式方法更简单直接。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is effective for teaching robots complex skills
with high sample efficiency. However, teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple
skills is difficult, as deviations accumulate, distributional shift increases,
and human teachers become fatigued, raising the chance of failure. In this
work, we study user responses to two teaching frameworks: (i) a traditional
monolithic approach, where users demonstrate the entire trajectory of a
long-horizon task; and (ii) a sequential approach, where the task is segmented
by the user and demonstrations are provided step by step. To support this
study, we introduce $(ST)^2$, a sequential method for learning long-horizon
manipulation tasks that allows users to control the teaching flow by defining
key points, enabling incremental and structured demonstrations. We conducted a
user study on a restocking task with 16 participants in a realistic retail
environment to evaluate both user preference and method effectiveness. Our
objective and subjective results show that both methods achieve similar
trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the
sequential approach for its iterative control, while others favored the
monolithic approach for its simplicity.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了反应式重规划必须更新现有计划的传统假设，提出使用快速几乎必然渐近最优（ASAO）规划算法将增量规划问题转化为一系列独立问题，从而更高效地处理动态环境中的路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反应式规划方法在更新密集规划图和检测环境变化时计算成本高，需要更高效的替代方案来处理动态环境中的路径规划问题。

Method: 使用快速几乎必然渐近最优（ASAO）规划算法，如Effort Informed Trees (EIT*)和Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect (AORRTC)，将增量规划问题转化为一系列独立问题，无需显式重用现有计划。

Result: 在模拟实验中，EIT*找到的中位解路径比测试的反应式规划算法更短，并在机器人臂的实际规划问题中通过AORRTC得到验证。

Conclusion: ASAO算法能够在不显式重用计划的情况下，在动态障碍物环境中找到一致的全局规划，提供比传统反应式规划方法更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Robots operating in changing environments either predict obstacle changes
and/or plan quickly enough to react to them. Predictive approaches require a
strong prior about the position and motion of obstacles. Reactive approaches
require no assumptions about their environment but must replan quickly and find
high-quality paths to navigate effectively.
  Reactive approaches often reuse information between queries to reduce
planning cost. These techniques are conceptually sound but updating dense
planning graphs when information changes can be computationally prohibitive. It
can also require significant effort to detect the changes in some applications.
  This paper revisits the long-held assumption that reactive replanning
requires updating existing plans. It shows that the incremental planning
problem can alternatively be solved more efficiently as a series of independent
problems using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning
algorithms. These ASAO algorithms quickly find an initial solution and converge
towards an optimal solution which allows them to find consistent global plans
in the presence of changing obstacles without requiring explicit plan reuse.
This is demonstrated with simulated experiments where Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*) finds shorter median solution paths than the tested reactive planning
algorithms and is further validated using Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) on a real-world planning problem on a robot arm.

Motivation: 解决机器人操作中策略泛化能力不足和样本效率低下的问题，特别是在面对未见过的空间布局、物体外观和任务组合时。

Method: 使用基础模型将演示分解为可迁移的对象规范化技能原语，在测试时将高层代理预测的技能-对象对映射回世界坐标系执行。

Result: 在仿真中，每个任务仅用3个演示训练的GSL比用30倍数据训练的基线在未见任务上性能提升15.5%；在真实世界实验中，GSL也优于用10倍数据训练的基线。

Conclusion: GSL的结构化但灵活设计显著提高了样本效率和泛化能力，在机器人操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We present Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a novel framework
for hierarchical policy learning that significantly improves policy
generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation. One core idea of
GSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level
vision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL
decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill
primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning
in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the
high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical
actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet
flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and
generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object
appearances, and task compositions. In simulation, GSL trained with only 3
demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30 times more data
by 15.5 percent on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses
the baseline trained with 10 times more data.

Conclusion: 结果突显了该机器人无关框架在恶劣条件下自主自组装和重构的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modular robots offer reconfigurability and fault tolerance essential for
lunar missions, but require controllers that adapt safely to real-world
disturbances. We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator
synchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive
velocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time
end-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its
translational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment
without abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based
version and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two
MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate
that the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions,
while the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains
millimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with
differing mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex).
These results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic
framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh
conditions.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by limited visibility, insufficient lighting, and
feature scarcity in underwater environments presents significant challenges to
visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph-based
visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system that integrates a stereo camera, an
inertial measurement unit (IMU), the Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a pressure
sensor. The key innovation lies in the tight integration of four distinct
sensor modalities to ensure reliable operation, even under degraded visual
conditions. To mitigate DVL drift and improve measurement efficiency, we
propose a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy. At the
frontend, hybrid tracking strategies and acoustic-inertial-depth joint
optimization enhance system stability. Additionally, multi-source hybrid
residuals are incorporated into a graph optimization framework. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed system are conducted in
both simulated and real-world underwater scenarios. The results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial
SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, exhibiting
exceptional robustness, particularly in visually challenging environments.

Abstract: In recent years, consumer-grade UAVs have been widely adopted by first
responders. In general, they are operated manually, which requires trained
pilots, especially in unknown GNSS-denied environments and in the vicinity of
structures. Autonomous flight can facilitate the application of UAVs and reduce
operator strain. However, autonomous systems usually require special
programming interfaces, custom sensor setups, and strong onboard computers,
which limits a broader deployment.
  We present a system for autonomous flight using lightweight consumer-grade
DJI drones. They are controlled by an Android app for state estimation and
obstacle avoidance directly running on the UAV's remote control. Our ground
control station enables a single operator to configure and supervise multiple
heterogeneous UAVs at once. Furthermore, it combines the observations of all
UAVs into a joint 3D environment model for improved situational awareness.

Abstract: Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary
exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper
introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable
surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion
planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages
joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications.
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing
stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain
probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and
dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made
collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to
traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing
safety.

Conclusion: PREVENT系统能够高效集成到现有软件架构中，显著提高移动化学机器人的工作流意识和自主操作可靠性。

Abstract: Mobile robotic chemists are a fast growing trend in the field of chemistry
and materials research. However, so far these mobile robots lack workflow
awareness skills. This poses the risk that even a small anomaly, such as an
improperly capped sample vial could disrupt the entire workflow. This wastes
time, and resources, and could pose risks to human researchers, such as
exposure to toxic materials. Existing perception mechanisms can be used to
predict anomalies but they often generate excessive false positives. This may
halt workflow execution unnecessarily, requiring researchers to intervene and
to resume the workflow when no problem actually exists, negating the benefits
of autonomous operation. To address this problem, we propose PREVENT a system
comprising navigation and manipulation skills based on a multimodal Behavior
Tree (BT) approach that can be integrated into existing software architectures
with minimal modifications. Our approach involves a hierarchical perception
mechanism that exploits AI techniques and sensory feedback through Dexterous
Vision and Navigational Vision cameras and an IoT gas sensor module for
execution-related decision-making. Experimental evaluations show that the
proposed approach is comparatively efficient and completely avoids both false
negatives and false positives when tested in simulated risk scenarios within
our robotic chemistry workflow. The results also show that the proposed
multi-modal perception skills achieved deployment accuracies that were higher
than the average of the corresponding uni-modal skills, both for navigation and

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了社会机器人的韧性特征，强调在医疗、教育等敏感领域中，韧性对于建立用户信任（特别是对老年人群体）的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能在医疗、教育等敏感领域的深入应用，需要确保这些系统具有韧性和鲁棒性，特别是在与老年人等信任度较低的群体互动时，韧性成为建立信任的关键要素。

Method: 论文将韧性定义为在不利或压力条件下，即使系统性能下降或减弱，仍能保持基本运行能力的能力。

Result: 研究表明韧性是社会机器人的基本特征，通过韧性可以确保用户对机器人本身的信任。

Conclusion: 韧性对于社会机器人在敏感环境中的成功部署至关重要，特别是在与老年人等信任度较低的群体互动时，韧性是建立和维护信任的基础。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated
into sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and everyday life, it's
crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust. This paper shows how
resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it,
ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating
in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems.
Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful
conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential
operational capabilities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出AURASeg地面分割模型，通过注意力引导上采样和边界细化模块，在保持高分割精度的同时提升边界精度，在室内外环境中实现精确的自主感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型在室内和结构化环境中难以处理细粒度特征，存在多尺度处理无效、边界细化不足和特征表示有限等问题，需要改进地面分割性能。

Method: 使用CSP-Darknet骨干网络，添加残差边界细化模块(RBRM)进行精确边缘划分，注意力渐进上采样解码器(APUD)进行强特征集成，以及轻量级ASPP-Lite模块实现多尺度上下文提取。

Result: 在GMRP数据集和自定义Gazebo室内数据集上超越基准分割架构，mIoU提升+1.26%，分割精度提升+1.65%，同时保持实时推理速度。

Conclusion: 该方法在室内外环境中都可行，能够实现精确的边界细化，且对推理速度影响最小，适用于自主感知应用。

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous
vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained
features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for
robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from
ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited
feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose
Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement
(AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high
segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses
CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for
accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder
(APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context
extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats
benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the
Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor
dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union
(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to
state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for
autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise
border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 实现安全可靠的现实世界机器人操作需要超越视觉感知，整合触觉传感来克服感官缺陷和对理想状态信息的依赖。尽管触觉传感具有潜力，但在强化学习中的效果仍不一致。

Method: 开发自监督学习方法来更有效地利用触觉观测，重点关注本体感觉和稀疏二进制接触的可扩展设置。将SSL记忆与在线策略记忆解耦以提升性能。

Result: 稀疏二进制触觉信号对灵巧性至关重要，特别是在本体感觉控制误差无法检测的解耦机器人-物体运动中。智能体在复杂接触任务（球弹跳和保定球旋转）中达到超人类灵巧性。

Conclusion: 触觉传感对机器人灵巧操作至关重要，自监督学习方法能有效利用触觉信号。发布了Robot Tactile Olympiad（RoTO）基准测试来标准化和促进触觉操作研究。

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Abstract: Micro aerial vehicles are becoming increasingly important in search and
rescue operations due to their agility, speed, and ability to access confined
spaces or hazardous areas. However, designing lightweight aerial systems
presents significant structural, aerodynamic, and computational challenges.
This work addresses two key limitations in many low-cost aerial systems under
two kilograms: their lack of structural durability during flight through rough
terrains and inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or
obstacles are detected. We present a fully customised drone built from scratch
using only commonly available components and materials, emphasising modularity,
low cost, and ease of assembly. The structural frame is reinforced with
lightweight yet durable materials to withstand impact, while the onboard
control system is powered entirely by free, open-source software solutions. The
proposed system demonstrates real-time perception and adaptive navigation
capabilities without relying on expensive hardware accelerators, offering an
affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于脑机接口(BCI)的实时注意力监测系统，使用非侵入式EEG头带来检测在线学习中的注意力状态，并通过反馈提醒显著提升学习专注度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习普及但缺乏有效的实时注意力监测方法，传统问卷需要人工干预，摄像头监控容易被屏幕注视欺骗，现有BCI方法缺乏实时验证评估。

Method: 使用FocusCalm EEG头带记录脑电波，通过滑动窗口分割、带通滤波、伪影去除处理信号，提取时频特征，采用SVM和递归特征消除进行注意力状态分类。

Result: 留一交叉验证准确率达88.77%，实时反馈实验显示反馈阶段注意力显著改善(t=5.73, p=0.007)。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效实时监测和改善在线学习注意力，为教育技术提供了可靠的脑机接口解决方案。

Abstract: Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring
of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire
assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to
provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by
mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based
approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address
these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a
non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record
brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data
were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational
video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire
assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window),
filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG
artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical
features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE)
with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention
states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been
tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention
state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a
10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback
followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if
participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A
paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant
improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具越来越多地用于创建职业人物形象，需要关注种族和性别表征的公平性问题。

Method: 对来自美国、中国、法国四个不同AI安全承诺的大型语言模型生成的41个美国职业的150万个人物形象进行大规模审计，并与美国劳工统计局数据对比。

Result: 发现系统性偏移（某些群体持续被低估或高估）和刻板印象夸大（现有的人口统计偏差被放大）两种模式。白人和黑人工作者平均被低估31%和9%，西班牙裔和亚裔被高估17%和12%。

Conclusion: 模型选择会显著影响可见性，需要针对特定模型进行审计和负责任的设计实践。

Abstract: Generative AI tools are increasingly used to create portrayals of people in
occupations, raising concerns about how race and gender are represented. We
conducted a large-scale audit of over 1.5 million occupational personas across
41 U.S. occupations, generated by four large language models with different AI
safety commitments and countries of origin (U.S., China, France). Compared with
Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we find two recurring patterns: systematic
shifts, where some groups are consistently under- or overrepresented, and
stereotype exaggeration, where existing demographic skews are amplified. On
average, White (--31pp) and Black (--9pp) workers are underrepresented, while
Hispanic (+17pp) and Asian (+12pp) workers are overrepresented. These
distortions can be extreme: for example, across all four models, Housekeepers
are portrayed as nearly 100\% Hispanic, while Black workers are erased from
many occupations. For HCI, these findings show provider choice materially
changes who is visible, motivating model-specific audits and accountable design
practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前教育中使用的大语言模型往往直接给出答案，这可能阻碍学生的概念理解和批判性思维发展，因此需要开发能引导学习者但不泄露答案的提示生成方法。

Method: 针对中学科学主题，研究比较了两种提示策略：静态提示（为每个问题预生成）和动态提示（根据学习者进度调整），通过41名参与者的定量研究进行分析。

Result: 研究发现学习者对不同提示策略有不同的偏好，同时揭示了自动评估指标在捕捉这些偏好方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来提示生成和智能辅导系统的设计提供了关键考虑因素，强调开发以学习者为中心的教育技术的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models are influencing the education landscape, with students
relying on them in their learning process. Often implemented using
general-purpose models, these systems are likely to give away the answers,
which could hinder conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We study the
role of automatic hint generation as a pedagogical strategy to promote active
engagement with the learning content, while guiding learners toward the
answers. Focusing on scientific topics at the secondary education level, we
explore the potential of large language models to generate chains of hints that
scaffold learners without revealing answers. We compare two distinct hinting
strategies: static hints, pre-generated for each problem, and dynamic hints,
adapted to learners' progress. Through a quantitative study with 41
participants, we uncover different preferences among learners with respect to
hinting strategies, and identify the limitations of automatic evaluation
metrics to capture them. Our findings highlight key design considerations for
future research on hint generation and intelligent tutoring systems that seek
to develop learner-centered educational technologies.

Motivation: 智能家居设备存在网络安全风险，但入侵检测系统的警报通常使用技术术语，普通用户难以理解。需要找到将技术警报转化为可操作安全通知的最佳方式。

Method: 通过在线用户研究，对130名参与者测试不同长度和复杂度的LLM生成通知，评估用户喜好、理解度和行动动机。

Result: 中等复杂度的通知在所有用户群体中效果最佳。初学者认为较长的通知更有效，专家则认为较短的通知稍好。

Conclusion: 中等复杂度的安全通知设计既能保持可操作性，又能广泛适用于不同技术水平的智能家居用户。

Abstract: The proliferation of smart home devices has increased convenience but also
introduced cybersecurity risks for everyday users, as many devices lack robust
security features. Intrusion Detection Systems are a prominent approach to
detecting cybersecurity threats. However, their alerts often use technical
terms and require users to interpret them correctly, which is challenging for a
typical smart home user. Large Language Models can bridge this gap by
translating IDS alerts into actionable security notifications. However, it has
not yet been clear what an actionable cybersecurity notification should look
like. In this paper, we conduct an experimental online user study with 130
participants to examine how the length and complexity of LLM-generated
notifications affect user likability, understandability, and motivation to act.
Our results show that intermediate-complexity notifications are the most
effective across all user groups, regardless of their technological
proficiency. Across the board, users rated beginner-level messages as more
effective when they were longer, while expert-level messages were rated
marginally more effective when they were shorter. These findings provide
insights for designing security notifications that are both actionable and
broadly accessible to smart home users.

Abstract: With the current progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its
increasingly broader applications, trust is seen as a required criterion for AI
usage, acceptance, and deployment. A robust measurement instrument is essential
to correctly evaluate trust from a human-centered perspective. This paper
describes the development and validation process of a trust measure instrument,
which follows psychometric principles, and consists of a 16-items trust scale.
The instrument was built explicitly for research in human-AI interaction to
measure trust attitudes towards AI systems from layperson (non-expert)
perspective. The use-case we used to develop the scale was in the context of AI
medical support systems (specifically cancer/health prediction). The scale
development (Measurement Item Development) and validation (Measurement Item
Evaluation) involved six research stages: item development, item evaluation,
survey administration, test of dimensionality, test of reliability, and test of
validity. The results of the six-stages evaluation show that the proposed trust
measurement instrument is empirically reliable and valid for systematically
measuring and comparing non-experts' trust in AI Medical Support Systems.

TL;DR: CESAR通过在线强化学习框架解决音频大语言模型中的推理逆缩放问题，将推理从性能负担转变为增益，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理过程常常导致性能下降，存在测试时逆缩放现象，即推理链越长性能越差，这源于缺乏对推理过程的适当训练指导。

Method: 采用在线强化学习框架，使用Group Relative Policy Optimization和多方面奖励机制，激励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上大幅超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平，同时提升了多模态推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: CESAR为开发稳健可扩展的音频大语言模型推理建立了原则性方法，证明通过适当训练指导可以显著提升推理质量。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于固定图拓扑的时空学习方法无法适应危机期间市场动态的变化，需要能够自适应发现资产间相关结构的模型。

Method: 使用图卷积网络编码空间关系，BiLSTM与自注意力编码时间动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，过滤92.5%的噪声连接。

Result: 在2005-2021年数据上训练，能泛化到2022-2024年通胀驱动市场，夏普比率达到3.76，比等权重基准提高707%，比静态图方法提高94%。

Conclusion: CRISP通过自适应学习危机相关依赖关系，实现了跨市场机制的稳健预测，注意力权重提供了可解释的机制检测能力。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Conclusion: 负向学习范式能够有效解决模态不平衡问题，保持弱模态的独特信息，提升多模态学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: RAG虽然能提高模型输出准确性，但引入外部知识库会带来长上下文处理挑战，显著增加内存消耗和推理延迟。现有方法通过预计算KV来加速推理，但仍有优化空间。

Method: 1. 基于KV块访问频率的热感知混合精度压缩加载方法；2. 热感知数据放置策略，将频繁访问的KV块优先存储到高速内存中。

Conclusion: HA-RAG系统通过热感知优化策略，有效解决了RAG推理中的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Result: 重尾SGD能够几乎完全避免尖锐极小值，找到几何更平坦的局部极小值，并在实验中表现出更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 重尾噪声注入和截断是增强SGD避免尖锐极小值能力的有效方法，能提升深度学习模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Motivation: AI系统在生物医学信号解读中表现优异，但临床实践中医生需要知道何时以及为何信任AI建议，因此研究透明AI辅助对临床决策的影响。

Method: 对8名专业睡眠医学从业者进行应用基础的用户研究，在三种条件下评分夜间觉醒事件：手动评分、黑盒AI辅助和透明白盒AI辅助，评估不同类型和时机的辅助对性能、时间和用户体验的影响。

Result: AI和人类-AI团队均显著优于无辅助专家，透明AI作为质量控制步骤比黑盒AI提升约30%的事件级性能，质量控制时机进一步改善计数结果。透明AI虽增加评分时间，但大多数参与者更偏好透明系统。

Conclusion: 策略性定时的透明AI辅助能有效平衡准确性和临床效率，为临床工作流程中可信AI集成和用户接受提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提方法达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过兼容区间目标的损失函数和min-max学习框架，成功解决了区间目标回归问题，在理论和实验上都取得了良好效果

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该框架为蛋白质突变分析建立了系统的元学习方法，提供了有效的突变编码策略，为蛋白质工程中的跨域泛化提供了变革性方法。

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

TL;DR: 提出LLM集成贝叶斯状态空间模型(LBS)，结合结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息进行多模态时序预测，支持灵活的时间窗口和不确定性量化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在架构上受限于固定的输入/输出时间范围，无法建模或量化不确定性，且难以整合结构化时序数据和非结构化文本信息

Method: LBS包含两个组件：(1)状态空间模型(SSM)骨干网络捕捉潜在状态的时间动态；(2)预训练大语言模型(LLM)编码文本输入进行后验状态估计，并解码与潜在轨迹一致的文本预测

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLM和SSM统一用于联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时序推理提供了新的基础

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无模型强化学习方法缺乏形式化安全保证，现有方法通常依赖详细的安全规范知识，但许多难以规范的安全问题最好通过不变性来表征。

Method: 利用可逆性作为防止训练过程中安全问题的方法，使用模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，只需能够查询黑盒动态系统。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提算法在所有不安全动作发生前成功中止，同时达到与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当的训练进度。

Conclusion: 该方法为强化学习提供了有效的安全保证，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识，仅需查询黑盒动态系统即可实现安全控制。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Motivation: 现有MAD协议将辩论视为零和博弈，导致辩论者为了获胜而误导法官，引入更多错误，表现不如单智能体方法。

Method: ColMAD协议鼓励多个智能体以支持性方式相互批评，补充彼此缺失的观点，使法官智能体能基于更全面的证据做出结论。

Result: ColMAD显著优于先前竞争性MAD 19%，并在错误检测上比单智能体方法带来非平凡改进。

Conclusion: 协作式辩论协议能有效缓解辩论黑客问题，提升大语言模型错误检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

Motivation: 现有互信息估计器要么依赖需要大量数据的复杂模型（如神经网络），要么使用过于简化的模型（如高斯copula）无法捕捉复杂分布，需要找到更好的折中方案

Result: 在先进合成基准测试和具有多种模态的真实世界数据上的实验证明了所提估计器的优势

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估INRs在特定领域应用中的准确性，特别是在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示方面的性能表现。

Method: 采用多种策略缓解频谱偏差，包括专用激活函数、固定和可训练位置编码、非线性核的线性组合，评估了SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE等架构。

Result: 在胸主动脉血流场中实现约230倍的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差1mmHg，速度误差5-10cm/s；48个主动脉解剖的平均和最大绝对误差分别低于0.5mm和1.6mm。

Conclusion: SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳，INRs在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中具有高压缩效率和准确性。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

TL;DR: MeDyate是一个理论基础的框架，用于内存受限的动态子网络适应，通过改进的层重要性度量和动态通道采样策略，在极端内存限制下实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决设备端神经网络训练面临的关键内存限制问题，使预训练模型能够适应下游任务。

Method: 引入LaRa（层排序）改进的层重要性度量，以及利用通道重要性分布时间稳定性的动态通道采样策略，在训练周期之间根据重要性加权概率动态重采样通道。

Result: 在大量任务和架构上的广泛评估表明，MeDyate在极端内存约束下实现了最先进的性能，始终优于现有的静态和动态方法，同时保持高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了向实现高效设备端学习的重要一步，展示了在低至几百kB RAM的内存预算下进行有效微调的能力。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的框架，用于在高维信念空间中捕捉复杂多模态分布，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束改进SVGD，在信念近似精度和决策质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境变得更加真实，信念分布变得复杂，标准数学模型无法准确捕捉，现有POMDP信念近似方法无法准确表示复杂不确定性结构，导致估计错误和次优代理行为。

Method: 扩展SVGD，引入相关感知投影来建模状态维度间的依赖关系，以及时间一致性约束来稳定更新同时保持相关结构，保留SVGD的吸引-排斥粒子动力学。

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布的广泛评估中，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量方面始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，有效解决了复杂高维多模态信念分布的表示问题。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Motivation: 大语言模型通常需要大量计算资源和内存进行推理，标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著的性能下降，需要更有效的量化方法。

Method: 采用分组格向量量化框架，为每组权重分配可学习生成矩阵定义的定制格码本，使用Babai舍入近似最近格点搜索来解决量化过程的不可微问题。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架为大规模语言模型的高效部署提供了一种有效的量化解决方案，在保持推理效率的同时显著减少了低比特量化的性能损失。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架能够训练出高效稀疏的脉冲神经网络，在多个时间序列分类任务中表现出色，特别适合低功耗的边缘部署应用。

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

Motivation: 解决现有图像自回归模型采样步骤多、生成速度慢的问题，特别是DD1方法在一步采样时性能下降严重且依赖预定义映射

Method: 将原始AR模型视为教师模型，提出条件分数蒸馏损失来训练一步生成器，在潜在嵌入空间中为每个token位置预测生成分布的条件分数

Conclusion: DD2为实现一步自回归生成迈出重要一步，为快速高质量AR建模开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Conclusion: 学习率的选择与算法设计同等重要，分层训练算法可以在不重复使用样本或修改损失函数的情况下实现超越相关性查询的效果。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

TL;DR: 提出A-GPS框架，用于在线离散黑盒多目标优化，通过生成模型学习帕累托集，支持用户偏好后验调节，避免显式超体积计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统多目标优化方法需要显式计算超体积、难以灵活融入用户偏好的问题，开发能高效学习帕累托集并支持偏好调节的方法。

Method: 使用类别概率估计器预测非支配关系，引导生成模型向高性能区域；引入偏好方向向量编码用户偏好；通过帕累托成员资格和偏好对齐更新模型。

Result: 在合成基准和蛋白质设计任务中表现出强样本效率和有效偏好融入能力，获得高质量的帕累托集近似。

Conclusion: A-GPS是简单而强大的方法，能灵活捕捉用户偏好，避免显式超体积计算，实现高效的多目标优化。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线多类选择问题的公平分配算法，通过无损舍入方案和资源预留机制确保群体公平性，同时支持学习增强变体来平衡公平与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文献中两个关键局限：缺乏无损舍入方案来保证整数解与分数解性能相同，以及未能有效处理属于多个类别的智能体带来的挑战。

Method: 基于松弛-舍入框架的随机算法，首先使用资源预留机制（预留机制）计算分数解以强制执行类别间公平性，然后通过无损舍入步骤保持公平性而不降低性能。

Result: 开发的无损舍入方案确保整数算法达到与任何分数解相同的期望性能，同时提出的学习增强变体能够更好地在实际设置中平衡公平性和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多类在线选择问题中的公平性挑战，通过创新的舍入技术和资源预留机制，为具有群体公平保证的资源分配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Motivation: 随着策略优化在机器人、医疗保健和大语言模型训练等敏感领域的广泛应用，隐私保护问题日益突出，需要研究差分隐私策略优化的理论基础。

Method: 首先形式化了适用于策略优化的差分隐私定义，然后通过统一框架系统分析了策略梯度、自然策略梯度等算法在差分隐私约束下的样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 研究为隐私保护策略优化算法提供了有价值的实践见解，证明了在保持隐私的同时实现有效策略优化的可行性。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made
publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space
weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are

Result: 该方法在两项挑战性基准测试中与自一致性等复杂方法竞争相当，同时显著降低计算开销

Conclusion: 最短答案启发式方法提供了相对于自一致性的帕累托改进，适用于输出相等性定义不明确的任务

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Motivation: 先前关于神经崩溃的理论研究主要将最后一层特征视为无约束的优化变量，通过分析类矩阵分解问题的优化景观来理解NC。本文旨在放松无约束特征的假设，探索数据结构和非线性激活对NC表征的影响。

Method: 使用两层ReLU网络对正交可分数据进行分类，通过分析梯度流动态来研究神经崩溃现象。

Result: 证明了梯度流在这种设置下会表现出神经崩溃现象，即网络学习到的表示会形成简单的特征结构。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对神经崩溃现象的理论理解，揭示了数据结构和训练动态的隐式偏置在促进NC出现中的关键作用。

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Conclusion: 提出的协同执行方法能有效利用移动设备的CPU和GPU资源，显著降低推理延迟，接近理论最优性能。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中梯度共享存在隐私泄露风险，而全同态加密方法计算和通信开销过高，现有方法在完全加密和部分加密之间存在权衡问题。

Method: 提出DePE模块将模型权重分解为静态字典和可更新查找表，仅加密传输后者；PrME模块通过加密感知剪枝最小化加密参数。

Result: 相比完全加密FL，通信成本降低402-748倍，训练加速28-65倍；相比选择性加密方法，开销减少51-155倍，速度提升4-19倍。

Conclusion: DictPFL首次证明基于HE的私有联邦学习在实际部署中是可行的，其运行时间仅为明文FL的2倍以内。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于基序驱动的全局-局部上下文图的少样本分子性质预测方法，通过引入化学基序节点构建三元异质图，在全局和局部层面丰富上下文信息，显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据，但在药物发现和材料科学中往往难以获得。现有的少样本分子性质预测方法虽然通过上下文图引入关系归纳偏置，但分子-属性图提供的结构指导有限。

Method: 在全局层面引入化学基序节点（如环或官能团）构建三元异质图，形成基序-分子-属性连接；在局部层面为每个分子-属性对构建子图并分别编码，使模型关注最相关的邻近分子和基序。

Result: 在五个标准FSMPP基准测试中，该方法持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 将全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文相结合，能够有效推进鲁棒的少样本分子性质预测。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个模型无关的框架，能够在多子群体间平衡下游预测的整体性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Conclusion: SolarBoost通过电网级建模方法有效解决了分布式光伏系统功率预测的挑战，理论和实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习有效的长期策略，这对于复杂、大规模的医疗物联网调度场景至关重要。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

### [150] [Scalable Principal-Agent Contract Design via Gradient-Based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21177)
*Tomer Galanti,Aarya Bookseller,Korok Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于主从合同设计的双层最大-最大优化框架，利用机器学习技术（隐式微分和共轭梯度）高效计算超梯度，无需形成或求逆Hessian矩阵，解决了传统方法在非线性效用、随机动态或高维行动场景下无法获得闭式解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主从合同设计是道德风险和合同理论的核心问题，涉及市场设计、委托投资组合管理、对冲基金费用结构和高管薪酬等应用。传统的线性-二次模型（如Holmstr"om-Milgrom）虽然有闭式解，但在非线性效用、随机动态或高维行动的现实环境中无法获得解析解。

Method: 采用现代机器学习技术进行双层优化，使用隐式微分结合共轭梯度计算超梯度，通过Hessian-向量积高效实现，无需形成或求逆Hessian矩阵。该方法是无矩阵的、方差减少的且与问题无关的。

Result: 在基准CARA-Normal环境中，该方法能够恢复已知的解析最优解，并从随机初始化可靠收敛。更重要的是，该方法可扩展到复杂非线性合同场景，如S形工资计划、相对绩效/锦标赛补偿、多任务合同和CARA-Poisson计数模型等传统方法无法处理的场景。

Conclusion: 为合同设计提供了一个新的计算工具，使得系统研究那些在分析上难以处理的模型成为可能，扩展了合同理论在复杂现实环境中的应用范围。

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

*Stephen Zhao,Aidan Li,Rob Brekelmans,Roger Grosse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率，从而在期望奖励和不良输出概率之间实现更好的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RL方法优化平均奖励，而专注于减少不良输出概率的方法通常会影响平均性能。为了改善这种权衡关系，需要一种既能保持良好平均性能又能有效减少不良输出的方法。

Method: RePULSe在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明，与标准RL对齐方法和替代方案相比，RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间实现了更好的权衡，并且具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe方法通过引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率，有效改善了强化学习对齐中的权衡问题，提供了更好的性能平衡和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

TL;DR: PLAN是一个持续学习框架，通过主动管理任务特定子空间分配，使用正交基向量和基于扰动的策略来最小化与先前学习参数的冲突，在保持高效适应新任务的同时减少对过去知识的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习需要模型在不忘记过去知识的情况下不断适应新任务。现有的方法在大型预训练模型的持续学习场景中面临效率和干扰问题。

Method: 扩展LoRA框架，引入任务特定的正交基向量，采用基于扰动的优化策略来最小化冲突，并包含新颖的选择机制来识别和分配干扰敏感性最小的基向量。

Result: 在标准持续学习基准测试中，PLAN始终优于现有方法，为基础模型的持续学习建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PLAN框架通过主动的子空间管理和干扰感知的微调，有效解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持了模型对新任务的高效适应能力。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GenReview数据集，这是迄今为止最大的包含LLM生成评审意见的数据集，包含81K条为ICLR 2018-2025投稿生成的评审意见，用于研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在科学同行评审中的使用日益普及，需要全面数据集来理解LLM部署的效用和影响，此前缺乏这样的数据集。

Method: 创建GenReview数据集，为ICLR 2018-2025所有投稿使用三种独立提示（负面、正面、中性）生成81K条LLM评审意见，并与原始论文和评审意见关联。

Result: 研究发现：LLM在评审中存在偏见；LLM生成的评审意见目前可以自动检测；LLM不能总是严格遵循评审指南；LLM提供的评分仅与论文接受决定一致。

Conclusion: GenReview数据集为研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响提供了重要资源，揭示了LLM在评审过程中的局限性和潜在问题。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

### [154] [Online AUC Optimization Based on Second-order Surrogate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21202)
*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于成对铰链损失的二阶代理损失函数，用于优化AUC性能，解决了传统方法在非凸、不连续损失和大规模应用中的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC是分类任务中重要的性能指标，特别是在类别不平衡场景下。但最小化AUC面临挑战：成对0/1损失的非凸性和不连续性难以优化，以及实例级存储的高内存成本在大规模应用中造成瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种新的二阶代理损失函数，基于成对铰链损失，并开发了高效的在线算法。与传统方法不同，该方法直接使用训练数据的一阶和二阶统计量构建代理损失函数来替代整个聚合的成对损失。

Result: 理论分析表明，现有在线AUC优化算法通常达到O(√T)的遗憾界，而该方法获得了更紧的O(ln T)遗憾界。通过核方法扩展到非线性设置，在多个基准数据集上的实验证明了该二阶代理损失在优化在线AUC性能方面的优越效率和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的二阶代理损失方法为AUC优化提供了一种新的范式，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能，特别是在大规模在线学习场景中。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于上下文学习的表格基础模型通过纯合成数据集预训练就能在真实数据上表现良好，但合成先验分布的设计原则仍不明确，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 系统分析合成先验分布的关键特性，并基于这些洞察开发Mitra模型，使用经过筛选的多样化、有区分度的合成先验分布混合进行训练。

Result: Mitra在分类和回归基准测试中一致优于TabPFNv2和TabICL等最先进的TFMs，并具有更好的样本效率。

Conclusion: 合成先验分布的设计对表格基础模型的泛化能力至关重要，Mitra通过精心设计的先验分布混合实现了更优的性能。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN的固定消息传递架构难以适应现实世界中图结构的多样性，而现有的图MoE方法依赖于监督信号且训练不稳定。

Method: 采用骨干-残差专家架构，基础编码器提供稳定性，专门残差专家捕获多样化计算模式，使用结构感知门控网络进行细粒度节点路由，通过统一无监督目标进行端到端训练。

Result: 在16个基准测试中验证了ADaMoRE在无监督节点分类和少样本学习方面的最先进性能，具有优越的泛化能力、训练效率和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: ADaMoRE通过无监督训练异构MoE，有效解决了GNN的适应性问题，在多样化图和任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Result: 在多种晶格尺寸下验证了该框架，在保持物理保真度的同时，随着晶格尺寸增大，生成速度优于蒙特卡洛方法。

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Result: 实验证明FDAs在模型合并中有效，且与参数空间模型合并方法互补。

Conclusion: FDAs框架通过输入表示空间建模，为模型合并提供了新的视角，结合了联合多任务训练和后验合并的优势。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效构建最混淆实例，且混淆程度与模型不确定性相关，这为深度模型强化学习的理论探索策略提供了启示。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行处理和引导机制成功解决了图注意力中的过度聚合问题，为图学习任务提供了一种有效的改进方案。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法主要依赖归一化层更新，但存在小批量敏感、依赖预训练统计量等限制，在显著域偏移下效果受限。

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效解决了归一化层更新的根本限制，验证了在真实世界域适应场景中的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于PatchTST变换器的噪声感知集成方法，通过传感器特定模型和测试匹配的数据增强，在噪声条件下实现鲁棒的人类活动识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中传感器噪声对人类活动识别的影响，特别是在WEAR数据集挑战中面对测试时的噪声扰动问题。

Method: 使用PatchTST变换器架构，为每个惯性传感器位置训练独立模型，应用随机抖动、缩放、旋转和通道丢失等数据增强技术，最后通过四个传感器模型的softmax概率平均进行集成推理。

Result: 在私有排行榜上取得了显著高于基线的macro-F1分数。

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强与基于变换器的集成是噪声条件下实现鲁棒人类活动识别的有效策略。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了DVC方法，一种预算感知的数据选择方法，用于多层感知机训练，通过分层评估数据贡献来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法（如核心集构建、数据Shapley值、影响函数）存在关键限制：过度简化非线性变换、忽略隐藏层中间表示、或由于高计算复杂度无法扩展到大型MLP。

Method: DVC方法将数据贡献分解为层值贡献(LVC)和全局值贡献(GVC)，使用六个精心设计的指标和高效算法，从质量、相关性和分布多样性三个维度捕获数据特征，并与UCB算法集成进行自适应源选择。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了神经网络分层数据评估的首个系统性处理，为大规模机器学习系统提供了理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GAMs通常被认为是可解释的ML模型，但生成其有意义解释的计算复杂性尚未得到系统研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，挑战GAMs解释生成必然高效的假设。

Method: 通过计算复杂性理论分析，在不同输入空间结构、组件模型类型（如线性、决策树、神经网络等）、回归与分类任务以及不同解释方法下，系统研究GAMs解释生成的计算复杂性。

Result: 研究发现：(1) GAMs解释复杂性受输入空间结构影响显著；(2) 组件模型类型的复杂性差异仅在特定输入域设置下显现；(3) 回归与分类任务的解释复杂性存在显著区别；(4) 将复杂模型表示为可加形式（如神经可加模型）仅对特定解释方法和输入域有益。

Conclusion: GAMs的解释生成计算复杂性呈现多样化图景，既有可行情况也有证明困难的情况，为理解GAMs解释的可行性提供了严格的理论框架。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

TL;DR: EPHAD是一个测试时自适应框架，用于在训练数据被污染的情况下更新异常检测模型的输出，结合了先验知识和多模态基础模型证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据集通常包含未被检测或错误标记的异常，导致异常检测模型性能显著下降，现有解决方案需要访问训练流程、数据或异常比例的先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EPHAD框架，在测试时使用多模态基础模型（如CLIP）、经典异常检测方法或领域特定知识收集的证据来更新在污染数据集上训练的异常检测模型的输出。

Result: 在8个视觉异常检测数据集、26个表格异常检测数据集和1个真实工业数据集上验证了有效性，并通过消融研究分析了超参数影响和对不同污染水平的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EPHAD在不同异常检测模型和证据对上展现出多功能性和鲁棒性，代码已公开以确保可复现性。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于摊销变分推理的概率框架，用于部分标签学习，通过神经网络预测变分参数，在保持架构无关性的同时实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据通常存在噪声和歧义，部分标签学习处理每个实例与多个候选标签关联的问题。现有方法要么计算密集，要么依赖启发式标签精炼。

Method: 使用摊销变分推理直接近似真实标签的后验分布，通过神经网络从输入数据预测变分参数，实现高效推理。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，为部分标签学习提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速扩展使得低精度训练变得至关重要，但现有收敛理论忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释为什么低精度训练仍然有效。

Method: 引入理论框架分析自适应优化器在梯度、权重和优化器状态浮点量化下的收敛性，在平滑非凸目标上推导收敛速率，明确量化不同组件的误差影响。

Result: 证明只要尾数长度与迭代次数呈对数关系，两种算法都能保持接近全精度的收敛速率；Adam对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制且更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该研究缩小了低精度训练方法的实证成功与理论理解之间的差距，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单而通用的方法来解决多臂老虎机中的公平性问题，通过初始均匀探索阶段后使用标准UCB算法，实现了对Nash遗憾和p-均值遗憾的近乎最优边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的遗憾度量无法解决奖励分配的公平性问题，特别是在需要公平分配奖励的场景中，如临床试验中的患者分配。现有的Nash遗憾方法需要强假设和专门算法设计，限制了其适用性。

Method: 采用初始均匀探索阶段后接标准上置信界(UCB)算法，仅依赖加性Hoeffding边界，可自然扩展到次高斯奖励分布。

Result: 该方法实现了近乎最优的Nash遗憾边界，并能推广到更广泛的p-均值遗憾类别，在所有p值上实现统一的（近乎）最优遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 简单的初始均匀探索加标准UCB算法能够有效解决多臂老虎机中的公平性问题，相比现有方法具有更好的通用性和更弱的假设要求。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

Motivation: 随着超人类模型日益复杂，人类可能无法有效监督其行为。现有弱到强泛化方法在分布偏移下表现不佳，甚至导致强模型性能比弱监督者更差。

Method: 提出RAVEN框架，动态学习弱模型的最优组合以及强模型的参数，自动识别可信的监督源。

Conclusion: RAVEN能够有效解决弱到强泛化在分布偏移下的挑战，自动分配更高权重给更准确的弱模型，实现鲁棒的监督学习。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据，存在隐私泄露风险，需要在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下净化模型。

Method: 采用遗忘学习框架，包括擦除阶段（重置最后几层神经元破坏细粒度信息记忆）和修复阶段（避免记忆敏感信息的微调）。

Result: 仅需少量额外训练轮次即可有效净化模型，显著减少敏感信息泄露次数，适用于医疗数据等场景。

Conclusion: SANI为已训练模型的隐私保护提供了一种高效解决方案，特别适合医院等行业在共享模型前进行净化处理。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Conclusion: ScoreNF为从非归一化概率分布中采样提供了一种高效且无偏的方法，特别适用于训练数据有限的情况。

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Motivation: 传统收益率曲线估计方法（如自助法和Nelson-Siegel模型）在债券稀疏、价格波动或噪声难以去除时存在过拟合或不稳定性问题，需要更稳健的估计方法。

Conclusion: 该神经网络框架为小型债券市场提供了有效的收益率曲线估计解决方案，允许从业者根据需求平衡平滑性和准确性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

*Jaesik Yoon,Hyeonseo Cho,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-MCTD通过引入三个组件（在线组合器、分布式组合器和预计划组合器）来提升MCTD，从单个轨迹优化扩展到完整计划组合的推理，解决了MCTD在训练轨迹长度和局部规划限制上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD虽然结合了扩散模型和树搜索进行轨迹探索，但受限于训练轨迹长度，且规划过程局部化，缺乏全局上下文。需要一种能够进行全局感知规划的方法。

Method: 提出了C-MCTD框架，包含三个组件：1）在线组合器进行全局感知规划；2）分布式组合器通过并行探索降低搜索复杂度；3）预计划组合器利用缓存计划图加速推理。

Result: C-MCTD能够从单个轨迹优化提升到完整计划组合的推理，实现更有效的全局规划。

Conclusion: C-MCTD通过组合式规划方法解决了MCTD的局限性，提供了更强大的轨迹探索和规划能力。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究使用大语言模型研究联想学习中的表征变化，发现符合非单调可塑性假说的模式，并揭示词汇干扰对表征分化的调节作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联想学习是认知的基础，但测试生物系统中表征变化假说具有挑战性。大语言模型提供了可扩展的替代方案来研究这些机制。

Method: 基于大语言模型的上下文学习能力，改编认知神经科学联想学习范式，在六个模型中研究表征演化，并利用模型可控性探索词汇干扰的影响。

Result: 发现中等相似项目在学习后发生分化，这种分化受词汇干扰调节——即新关联与先验知识的竞争程度。更高的词汇干扰会放大分化。

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究类人学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假说的可访问通用计算模型。

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairImagen是一个后处理去偏框架，通过在提示嵌入上操作来减轻文本到图像扩散模型中的社会偏见，无需重新训练或修改底层模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）经常复制和放大社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族等人口统计属性方面，需要有效的去偏方法。

Method: 使用公平主成分分析将CLIP输入嵌入投影到最小化群体特定信息同时保留语义内容的子空间，并通过经验噪声注入和统一跨人口统计投影方法增强去偏效果。

Result: 在性别、种族和交叉设置上的广泛实验表明，FairImagen显著提高了公平性，在图像质量和提示保真度方面有适度权衡，优于现有的后处理方法。

Conclusion: FairImagen提供了一个简单、可扩展且模型无关的解决方案，用于实现公平的文本到图像生成。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机神经网络和前向正则化的在线任务无关类增量学习框架，有效解决非独立同分布数据流下的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量学习中的两个实际问题：(1) 非独立同分布批量数据流且无边界提示的在线任务无关场景；(2) 长任务流中的记忆丢失问题。

Method: 使用随机神经网络和前向正则化框架，集成无监督知识到递归凸优化中，提出edRVFL-kF算法实现单次闭式增量更新和可变学习率，并通过贝叶斯学习自适应调整参数。

Result: 在2个图像数据集上的6个指标测试显示，该方法在动态性能、消融测试和兼容性方面均表现出色，有效避免灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 提出的OTCIL框架通过前向正则化和贝叶斯自适应机制，在在线任务无关类增量学习中实现了高效决策和低累积遗憾，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在预期性能改进不理想时希望提前停止HPO过程的问题，考虑计算成本与性能之间的权衡。

Method: 在冻结-解冻框架中引入效用函数，结合新的采集函数和停止准则，动态选择最有潜力的配置继续训练，并通过迁移学习提高样本效率。

Result: 在标准多保真度HPO基准测试中，算法优于所有现有的冻结-解冻BO和迁移BO基线方法，在成本和性能之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决成本敏感HPO问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为实际应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦的模块化归纳偏置——组合偏置，通过随机重混合潜在变量并强制编码器发现混合策略反映的因子结构，实现了无需修改目标或架构即可解耦属性、对象甚至两者的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解耦表示学习方法严重依赖特定因子的策略，当新的变异因子不符合先验假设或多个因子共存时，需要重新设计架构或目标，造成显著开销。

Method: 随机根据因子特定规则重混合潜在变量，使用两种互补目标：确保每次重混合都能解码为真实图像的先验损失，以及Wiedemer等人提出的组合一致性损失。

Result: 在属性和对象解耦方面表现出竞争性性能，并独特地实现了全局风格和对象的联合解耦。

Conclusion: 通过简单的调整混合策略，该方法能够解耦属性、对象甚至两者，而无需修改目标或架构，为解耦表示学习提供了灵活通用的框架。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

*Guanxiong Luo,Shoujin Huang,Yanlong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-diffusion是一种无需预训练生成模型的新型逆问题求解框架，通过交替的加噪和去噪步骤逐步优化解估计，使用随机初始化的单卷积网络作为自去噪器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散方法需要预训练模型来学习反向噪声过程，而self-diffusion旨在开发一个自包含的迭代过程，不依赖预训练模型或外部去噪器。

Method: 提出交替的加噪和去噪迭代过程：向当前估计添加噪声，然后使用随机初始化的单卷积网络通过数据保真度损失训练自去噪器，利用神经网络的频谱偏置和调度噪声过程。

Result: 在线性逆问题上，self-diffusion实现了与其他方法相当或更优的性能，且能适应任意前向算子和噪声观测。

Conclusion: Self-diffusion提供了一种灵活且广泛适用的逆问题求解方法，无需预训练分数函数或外部去噪器，仍能保持对任意前向算子的适应性。

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

TL;DR: 提出Generative Correlation Manifolds (GCM)方法，通过Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵生成合成数据，数学上保证保留源数据集的完整相关结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法只能复制简单汇总统计量，但无法保留定义真实世界系统复杂多变量交互的成对和高阶相关结构，导致合成数据在复杂建模任务中失效。

Method: 使用Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵来生成合成数据，该方法计算效率高且数学上保证保留完整相关结构。

Result: GCM方法能够保留从简单成对关系到高阶交互的完整相关结构，为合成数据生成提供了新途径。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和仿真等应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的极限学习机（PIELM）框架，用于解决逆Stefan问题。该方法用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过最小二乘法优化输出权重，显著提高了预测精度和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题，需要开发更高效准确的方法。

Method: 使用极限学习机网络替代深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过最小二乘法优化输出权重，将逆Stefan问题转化为寻找Moore-Penrose广义逆的问题。

Result: 相比传统PINNs，PIELM将相对L2误差提高了3-7个数量级的预测精度，同时节省了超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为逆Stefan问题提供了一种快速、准确的物理信息学习方法，显著优于传统PINNs方法。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoD的新策略，通过系统性地融入反事实解释来实现少样本任务感知知识蒸馏，仅需少量样本就能精确映射教师模型的决策边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务感知蒸馏方法通常需要大量数据，但在许多实际场景中这些数据可能不可用或获取成本高昂。

Method: CoD策略利用反事实解释（CFEs）——能够以最小扰动翻转教师模型输出预测的输入，来精确映射教师决策边界。从统计和几何角度提供了理论保证。

Result: 在各种数据集和LLMs上的实验表明，CoD在少样本场景（低至8-512个样本）中优于标准蒸馏方法。CoD仅使用基线方法一半的原始样本及其对应的CFEs，仍能提升性能。

Conclusion: CoD是一种有效的少样本任务感知知识蒸馏方法，通过反事实解释显著减少所需数据量，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Conclusion: GSAC框架成功解决了大规模网络系统中的可扩展性和领域泛化问题，通过因果表示和元学习实现了高效的学习和快速适应能力。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

Motivation: 在安全关键环境中部署强化学习受到分布偏移脆弱性的限制，需要开发高效的OOD检测方法。

Method: DEEDEE使用仅两个统计量的最小化方法：episodewise均值和RBF核相似度，捕捉全局和局部偏差。

Result: DEEDEE在标准RL OOD测试套件中匹配或超越现有检测器，计算量减少600倍，准确率平均提升5%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，多样异常类型通常通过少量低阶统计量在RL轨迹中留下印记，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: 提出了统一令牌表示(UTR)方法，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，显著减少序列长度和模型复杂度，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer离线强化学习方法存在令牌冗余和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发了UTR方法，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单一令牌，并基于此构建了UDT(Transformer架构)和UDC(门控CNN架构)两个变体。

Result: 理论分析显示UTR具有更紧的Rademacher复杂度边界，表明更好的泛化能力。两个变体在性能相当或优于现有方法的同时，计算量显著降低。

Conclusion: UTR方法在不同架构上都能良好泛化，可能为未来大规模决策模型提供高效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

Result: 实现了高达665倍的加速比，成功训练了70亿参数的LSTM和GRU模型，其困惑度与同等规模的Transformers和Mamba2架构相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN突破了非线性RNN的序列并行化障碍，为高效序列建模研究提供了开源框架，使研究人员能够大规模探索新的非线性RNN模型。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

TL;DR: 提出将个性化解释作为推荐本身来学习的方法，通过预测用户会为物品拍摄什么照片来生成解释，增强推荐系统的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释复杂系统（如推荐系统）的输出对用户和公司都越来越重要，需要找到能说服用户的个性化解释方式。

Method: 假设用户拍摄照片是为了强化或证明对物品的观点，因此预测用户会为物品拍摄什么照片作为解释。建立形式化框架估计给定（用户，照片）对的作者概率。

Result: 使用TripAdvisor数据验证方法，包含六个不同规模城市的餐厅评论和照片。

Conclusion: 通过预测用户会拍摄的照片，推荐系统可以解释其推荐结果并提高可靠性，同时帮助企业了解客户关注的产品特性。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

TL;DR: HINet提出了一种结合图神经网络和领域对抗训练的新方法，用于在网络设置中估计异质性处理效应，解决了未知暴露映射和网络级协变量偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知的暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际；同时同质性和处理分配机制的相互作用会引发网络级协变量偏移，导致处理效应估计不准确。

Method: 将图神经网络与领域对抗训练相结合，在未知暴露映射下估计处理效应，同时减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet方法能够有效处理网络环境中的异质性处理效应估计问题，特别是在未知暴露映射和存在协变量偏移的情况下。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图神经网络在编码高阶结构时存在过拟合和可扩展性问题，需要既具表达能力又高效的模型。

Method: 基于线性化超图神经网络的统一公式，引入可处理的权重矩阵闭式解和冗余感知传播方案，避免迭代训练。

Result: 在11个真实超图基准测试中，ZEN在分类准确率上持续优于8个基线模型，同时实现高达696倍的加速。

Conclusion: ZEN在保持表达能力和效率的同时，决策过程完全可解释，为数据集特性提供洞察。

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对联邦持续时间序列预测中灾难性遗忘问题的基准框架，使用北京多站点空气质量数据集评估了多种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘在联邦学习环境中是一个持续挑战，特别是在非独立同分布的时间序列数据中。现有研究主要关注视觉领域的分类任务，而物联网和边缘应用中普遍存在的基于回归的预测设置研究不足。

Method: 使用北京多站点空气质量数据集在12个去中心化客户端上，系统评估了多种灾难性遗忘缓解策略，包括重放、弹性权重巩固、无遗忘学习和突触智能等方法。

Result: 建立了一个新的基准框架，进行了全面的比较分析，并发布了可复现的开源框架。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进联邦时间序列预测系统中的持续学习提供了必要的工具和见解。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Vapnik和Chervonenkis的均匀收敛框架，引入Uniform Mean Estimability（UME-learnability）概念，研究分布集合在任意估计器下是否允许均匀均值估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工作主要关注使用经验均值估计器的均匀收敛（P-Glivenko-Cantelli原则），本文旨在超越经验均值估计器，研究更一般的均匀均值可估计性条件。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量的可分性条件，并构造非可分但UME可学习的分布集合反例。

Result: 证明均值向量的可分性是UME可学习的充分条件，但非必要条件；构造了非可分但UME可学习的分布集合；证明了UME可学习集合的可数并也是UME可学习的。

Conclusion: 解决了Cohen等人（2025）提出的猜想，建立了均匀均值可估计性的新理论框架，超越了传统经验均值估计器的限制。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Motivation: 生成流网络能够根据奖励函数采样高奖励的复杂对象，但奖励函数通常是从噪声数据中近似估计的，导致学习策略存在认知不确定性

Method: 构建基于多项式混沌展开的代理模型，在少量训练好的流网络集成上拟合，学习低维参数化奖励函数与流网络轨迹中每个步骤动作概率分布之间的关系

Conclusion: 该方法能有效量化生成流网络在不确定奖励函数下的策略不确定性，为策略可靠性评估提供了实用工具

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一模型(UM)解决无人机灾后道路评估中的8种路由变体问题，通过单一神经网络实现多配置训练，显著减少训练时间和参数，在解决方案质量上优于单任务深度强化学习和传统优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后道路评估对应急响应至关重要，但现有方法存在扩展性差、需要领域专业知识、单任务模型缺乏适应性等问题，无法满足动态灾害场景的需求。

Method: 使用现代transformer编码器-解码器架构，通过多问题配置训练单一神经网络，采用轻量级适配器机制实现对新属性的高效微调。

Result: UM将训练时间和参数减少8倍，解决方案质量比单任务DRL方法提高6-14%，比传统优化方法提高24-82%，在1000节点网络中实现1-10秒实时求解。

Conclusion: UM为基于无人机的灾后道路评估提供了计算高效、高质量且适应性强的解决方案，推动了时间关键应用的神经组合优化发展。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究使用探针检测模型内部激活来识别不良行为，并探讨将其作为训练目标时可能出现的Goodhart定律问题。提出了两种基于探针的训练方法，发现在偏好优化中探针可检测性保持较好，且探针多样性益处有限，重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针能够检测模型内部激活中的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），这些行为难以仅从输出中识别。但将探针作为训练目标时，可能面临Goodhart定律问题——当监控指标成为训练目标时，其可靠性可能下降。

Method: 提出了两种基于探针的训练方法：监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）。在毒性减少测试平台上进行实验，评估训练后探针准确率的下降程度。尝试了三种策略来保持探针检测器准确性：（1）训练针对探针集合，（2）保留未用于训练的探针，（3）训练后重新训练新探针。

Result: 1. 基于探针的偏好优化意外地比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针可检测性，表明偏好学习目标激励保持而非模糊相关表征。2. 探针多样性提供的实际益处有限——优化后简单地重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练对于某些对齐方法可能是可行的，但当重新训练可行时，探针集合在很大程度上是不必要的。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲（SRD）的伪异常生成方法，通过在正常视频的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性，从而增强弱监督视频异常检测模型的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型对对抗攻击脆弱，但由于弱监督仅提供视频级标签而需要帧级预测，传统对抗训练方法无效。直接使用模型生成的伪标签进行帧级对抗训练会因标签噪声严重降低性能。

Method: 提出SRD方法，在正常视频的局部区域应用严重增强来创建精确标注的合成异常，保持时间一致性。将这些合成异常与噪声伪标签结合，显著减少标签噪声，实现有效的对抗训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了WSVAD模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，整体AUROC性能平均比最先进方法高出71.0%。

Conclusion: SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效解决了弱监督视频异常检测中对抗训练的标签噪声问题，显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了修订相似性问题，并开发了一种新的静态度量方法——切除分数(ES)，通过移除现有文档与修订版本共享的内容，专注于比较差异区域，从而更准确地评估文档修订质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流行的成对度量方法（如BLEU）在评估文档修订时存在根本缺陷，它们的分数被共享内容主导，导致在人类认为修订差异很大时仍报告高相似度。

Method: 提出切除分数(ES)，使用最长公共子序列(LCS)移除现有文档与真实修订和预测修订共享的内容，然后仅比较剩余的不同区域。通过近似方法将标准立方LCS计算加速到二次复杂度。

Result: 在代码编辑评估中，ES显著优于现有度量方法。在HumanEvalFix上与测试执行对齐时，ES比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高了12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准度量如BLEU提高了>21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES对SARI的改进增加到20%，对标准度量的改进增加到>30%。

Conclusion: ES是一种更有效的修订相似性度量方法，能够正确处理共享上下文、代码块移动、匹配插入或删除等复杂情况，与人类判断更好地对齐。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Method: 采用分层SAGIN-MEC架构，提出MADDPG-COCG算法：使用MADDPG优化连续时间决策，结合凸优化和联盟博弈处理混合变量决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比基准算法，MADDPG-COCG显著降低了用户设备总成本、任务完成延迟和能耗，仅略微增加无人机能耗，且具有更好的收敛稳定性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法有效解决了SAGIN-MEC中的复杂优化问题，为低空经济提供了高效的计算服务解决方案。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

TL;DR: 该论文通过开发无监督学习工具研究深度神经网络内部表示机制，包括提出Gride方法估计数据内在维度、分析隐藏层概率密度演化模式，以及揭示宽神经网络通过冗余表示而非过拟合来提升泛化性能。


<details>

Motivation: 理解深度神经网络如何创建有意义的表示并实现泛化的内部机制，特别是表征隐藏表示的语义内容。

Method: 开发无监督学习工具：1) Gride方法估计数据内在维度；2) 分析隐藏层概率密度演化；3) 研究宽神经网络中的冗余表示现象。

Result: 1) Gride方法能有效估计数据内在维度；2) 隐藏层概率密度呈现层次化峰值结构，反映概念语义层次；3) 宽神经网络通过冗余表示而非过拟合提升泛化性能。

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

TL;DR: REVE是一个专门为EEG信号设计的预训练基础模型，通过创新的4D位置编码处理任意长度和电极配置的信号，在92个数据集上预训练，在10个下游任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型难以泛化到不同协议、设备和电极配置的异构数据集，限制了在脑电图领域的应用。

Method: 引入4D位置编码方案，使用掩码自编码目标在92个数据集上预训练，涵盖60,000小时EEG数据和25,000名受试者。

Result: 在10个下游EEG任务中达到最先进结果，包括运动想象分类、癫痫检测、睡眠分期等，展示出强大的泛化能力和时空建模能力。

Conclusion: REVE推动了EEG研究的标准化，为临床神经科学提供了加速发展的工具，并发布了代码、预训练权重和教程。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HOPSS算法，通过同源扰动方法在解空间中直接生成训练数据集，显著减少传统数值方法生成数据所需的时间步数，降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动的深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，计算开销巨大。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数并降采样对齐时间步，然后通过同源扰动方法（将一个解函数作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项，加上随机噪声）高效生成精度相当的PDE数据点，最后计算原始方程右端项变化形成新的解对。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度，在Navier-Stokes方程上生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够显著加速PDE训练数据集的生成，同时保持模型训练所需的近似精度，为解决非线性时间偏微分方程的数据生成问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

TL;DR: 本文为张量网络(TN)模型提出了首个可证明精确的SHAP解释计算框架，特别针对张量链(TT)结构实现了并行多对数时间计算，并将该结果推广到决策树、线性模型等多种流行模型，同时揭示了在二值化神经网络中宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP解释对于决策树等简单模型可在多项式时间内计算，但对于神经网络等更复杂的黑盒模型则变为NP难问题，而这类模型恰恰最需要解释。本文旨在为更广泛的张量网络模型提供高效的SHAP计算方案。

Method: 提出了一个通用框架来计算任意结构张量网络的精确SHAP解释，特别针对张量链结构设计了并行多对数时间算法，并通过将二值化神经网络约简为张量网络表示来分析计算复杂度。

Result: 对于张量链结构的张量网络，SHAP计算可在多对数时间内并行完成；该结果可推广到决策树、树集成、线性模型和线性RNN等模型；对于二值化神经网络，当网络宽度固定时SHAP计算变得高效可处理，而深度固定时仍计算困难。

Conclusion: 张量网络为SHAP计算提供了高效框架，张量链结构实现了突破性的计算效率；在神经网络解释中，宽度而非深度是主要的计算瓶颈，这为模型设计和解释方法提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Conclusion: GFM统一并提升了现有的欧几里得少步生成模型到黎曼流形设置，为几何生成任务提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

TL;DR: 该论文建立了在流行度调整块模型(PABM)下图聚类的理论极限，揭示了PABM能够捕捉DCBM忽略的局部连接模式差异，即使传统边密度信号消失时仍能进行聚类恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型(SBM和DCBM)的局限性，SBM假设均匀顶点度，DCBM在集群间应用统一度校正，而PABM引入了集群内和集群间连接的独立流行度参数。

Method: 在PABM下表征最优聚类错误率，分析谱嵌入方法，比较使用前k个特征向量与前k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法性能。

Result: 证明在PABM中，即使传统边密度信号消失，只要集群内和集群间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能。数值实验证实包含k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PABM捕捉了DCBM忽略的度异质性维度，局部连接模式差异可以独立于全局边密度增强集群可分性，需要更丰富的谱嵌入方法。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀疏场景下，等变网络能改善建模效果，不确定性估计能防止过度自信，但等变性与模型置信度、校准之间的关系尚未被研究。

Method: 通过证明不同等变条件下不确定性校准误差（ECE和ENCE）的上下界，建立等变性与不确定性估计的理论框架，并用真实和模拟数据集进行数值实验验证。

Result: 理论分析阐明了等变模型的泛化界限，实验结果表明对称性不匹配会导致分类和回归任务中的校准错误，并揭示了对称性大小、偶然性和认知不确定性之间的关系。

Conclusion: 等变性对模型校准有重要影响，对称性不匹配会损害模型的校准性能，这为理解等变网络在不确定性估计中的作用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Result: 分析显示求解器自然发展出反映基本TSP概念的特征：凸包节点的边界检测器、对局部密集区域响应的聚类敏感特征，以及编码几何分割的分隔符特征。

Conclusion: 这首次提供了神经TSP求解器在节点选择前计算内容的模型内部解释，证明几何结构在没有显式监督的情况下出现，并为结合神经效率和算法可解释性的透明混合系统指明了路径。

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Motivation: 旨在从群作用观察对中学习等变嵌入，不依赖群特定归纳偏置，实现通用编码器的等变学习。

Method: 联合学习潜在空间和群表示，使群作用对应可逆线性映射，通过对比学习从观察对(y, g·y)中提取等变性。

Conclusion: 首次成功演示了仅从群作用观察中实现通用编码器等变学习，包括非平凡非阿贝尔群和计算机视觉中仿射等变建模的乘积群。

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

Motivation: 传统设施选址问题中每个代理只关心最近的设施，而本文考虑每个代理希望所有委员会成员都接近自己的情况，需要同时满足成本最小化、公平性和代表性。

Conclusion: 在度量空间中选择代表委员会时，可以同时实现低成本、公平性和代表性，新算法能够形成满足所有这些要求的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a representative committee of $k$ agents
from a collection of $n$ agents in a common metric space. This problem is
related to choosing $k$ facilities in facility location and $k$-median
problems. However, unlike in more traditional facility location where each
agent only cares about the closest selected facility, in the settings we
consider each agent desires that all selected committee members are close to
them. More precisely, we look at the sum objective, in which the goal is to
minimize the total distance from all agents to all members of the chosen
committee. We show that it is always possible to find a committee which is both
low-cost according to this objective, and also fair according to many existing
notions of fairness and proportionality defined for clustering settings.
Moreover, we introduce a new desirable axiom for representative committees we
call NORP, which prevents over-representation of any subset of agents. While
all existing algorithms for fair committee selection do not satisfy this
intuitive property, we provide new algorithms which form simultaneously
low-cost, fair, and NORP solutions, thus showing that it is always possible to
form low-cost, fair, and representative committees for our settings.

Conclusion: 建立了统计决策理论与机制设计的联系，展示了如何利用异质性和战略参与来提高假设检验的效率。

Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic
agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the
population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the
performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how
it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal
tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their
private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the
principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of
the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all
separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an
arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where
information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible
additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving
statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper
scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test
constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the
geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error
trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with
mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation
can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.

Conclusion: 为社交网络中的移位贿赂提供了详细的复杂性图景，证明问题在一般设置下计算困难，但在特定网络结构和假设下存在高效算法。

Abstract: In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying
voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters
act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in
reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a
social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby
amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks,
where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs
represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not
confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the
network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and
individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a
designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists
within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and
network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is
NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when
parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design
polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority
rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for
transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform
arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further
prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as
parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and
pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform
arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for
shift bribery in social networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究能够在不同价格尺度下都保持稳健的拍卖机制，确保无论是昂贵还是廉价物品都能获得接近最优的收益。

Method: 证明了最优机制具有尺度不变性，采用在第二价格和2.45倍第二价格之间随机化的销售策略。

Result: 发现最优机制是尺度不变的，通过随机化策略能够实现最坏情况下的最佳收益近似。

Conclusion: 通过尺度不变的最优拍卖机制设计，可以在任何价格尺度下实现稳健的收益表现。

Abstract: We study auctions that are robust at any scale, i.e., they can be applied to
sell both expensive and cheap items and achieve the best multiplicative
approximations of the optimal revenue in the worst case. We show that the
optimal mechanism is scale invariant, which randomizes between selling at the
second-price and a 2.45 multiple of the second-price.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于多智能体系统激励设计的参数化平均场博弈框架和AMID算法，通过无限种群极限降低复杂度，在拍卖等场景中显著提升收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为多智能体系统设计激励以诱导期望的纳什均衡是关键但具有挑战性的问题，特别是在智能体数量N很大时。现有方法在大规模场景下面临复杂度高的困难。

Method: 提出参数化平均场博弈(PMFG)框架，在可交换性假设下通过无限种群极限降低复杂度。开发AMID算法，通过显式微分迭代均衡算子来高效计算梯度。

Result: 证明在Lipschitz条件下有限N目标函数可由PMFG以O(1/√N)速率近似，在序列拍卖等非连续场景中同样成立。AMID算法在多种拍卖设置中显著超越一价拍卖格式和现有基准方法。

Conclusion: AMID算法结合近似边界和优化保证，为大规模多智能体激励设计提供了强大且可扩展的算法工具，在收益提升方面表现优异。

Abstract: Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash
equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many
decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the
exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as
a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an
infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are
Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate
$\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous
setting, we prove the same $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the
important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in
dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel
approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive
Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated
equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting
approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,
scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction
settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over
first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.

### [220] [Privacy Guarantee for Nash Equilibrium Computation of Aggregative Games Based on Pointwise Maximal Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21668)
*Zhaoyang Cheng,Guanpu Chen,Tobias J. Oechtering,Mikael Skoglund*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于点态最大泄露(PML)的隐私保护框架，用于聚合博弈中的纳什均衡计算，相比差分隐私(DP)能更精确地评估相关数据集的信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私在评估相关数据集的信息泄露方面存在不足，且无法利用数据集的先验分布知识。需要一种更精确的隐私度量方法来设计纳什均衡计算算法。

Method: 建立点态最大泄露(PML)框架，结合玩家成本函数数据集的先验知识，获得具有PML保证的隐私泄露精确可计算上界。

Result: PML通过提供更严格的隐私保证来改进DP，在个体视角下，通过构建特定相关数据集证明PML下界可以超过DP上界。实验验证了框架在对抗玩家隐私信息推断方面的有效性。

Conclusion: PML是比DP更合适的隐私度量方法，因为后者无法充分捕捉相关数据集中的隐私泄露。

Abstract: Privacy preservation has served as a key metric in designing Nash equilibrium
(NE) computation algorithms. Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely
employed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional
knowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for
correlated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise
maximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By
incorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a
precise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In
the entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy
guarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the
individual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper
bound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets. The results emphasize
that PML is a more proper privacy measure than DP since the latter fails to
adequately capture privacy leakage in correlated datasets. Moreover, we conduct
experiments with adversaries who attempt to infer players' private information
to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.

### [221] [Seemingly Redundant Modules Enhance Robust Odor Learning in Fruit Flies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21315)
*Haiyang Li,Liao Yu,Qiang Yu,Yunliang Zang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算模型发现果蝇嗅觉回路中的侧向抑制和神经元放电频率适应机制在噪声环境中发挥不同作用，两者结合能实现最优的嗅觉模式分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究果蝇嗅觉回路中侧向抑制和神经元放电频率适应这两种看似功能相似的机制是否具有冗余性，以及它们在复杂噪声环境中的具体作用。

Method: 构建果蝇嗅觉回路的计算模型，在不同噪声条件下模拟气味辨别过程，分析两种机制的表现。

Result: 侧向抑制主要在低中噪声条件下提升气味辨别能力，但在高噪声下效果减弱甚至反转；而神经元放电频率适应在所有噪声水平下都能持续改善辨别性能。

Conclusion: 生物回路中看似冗余的模块实际上在复杂环境中具有互补作用，共同实现最优学习性能。

Abstract: Biological circuits have evolved to incorporate multiple modules that perform
similar functions. In the fly olfactory circuit, both lateral inhibition (LI)
and neuronal spike frequency adaptation (SFA) are thought to enhance pattern
separation for odor learning. However, it remains unclear whether these
mechanisms play redundant or distinct roles in this process. In this study, we
present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor
discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex
environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination
in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse
under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves
discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low-
and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings.
When combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal
discrimination performance. This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant
modules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal
learning in complex contexts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出时空有效感受野(ST-ERF)来分析基于Transformer的脉冲神经网络的感受野分布，发现这些模型难以建立稳健的全局ST-ERF，从而限制了视觉特征建模能力。为此提出了MLPixer和SRB两种通道混合器架构来增强全局空间感受野。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在视觉长序列建模任务中难以达到竞争性性能，而有效感受野是分析视觉长序列建模中特征提取能力的重要工具。

Method: 提出时空有效感受野(ST-ERF)分析框架，并基于此设计了两种通道混合器架构：MLPixer和SRB，通过在早期网络阶段增强全局空间感受野来提升性能。

Result: 在Meta-SDT变体以及目标检测和语义分割任务上的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的ST-ERF框架可以为更广泛任务中SNN架构的设计和优化提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) demonstrate significant potential for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing through an event-driven paradigm. While
training methods and computational models have greatly advanced, SNNs struggle
to achieve competitive performance in visual long-sequence modeling tasks. In
artificial neural networks, the effective receptive field (ERF) serves as a
valuable tool for analyzing feature extraction capabilities in visual
long-sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal
Effective Receptive Field (ST-ERF) to analyze the ERF distributions across
various Transformer-based SNNs. Based on the proposed ST-ERF, we reveal that
these models suffer from establishing a robust global ST-ERF, thereby limiting
their visual feature modeling capabilities. To overcome this issue, we propose
two novel channel-mixer architectures:
\underline{m}ulti-\underline{l}ayer-\underline{p}erceptron-based
m\underline{ixer} (MLPixer) and \underline{s}plash-and-\underline{r}econstruct
\underline{b}lock (SRB). These architectures enhance global spatial ERF through
all timesteps in early network stages of Transformer-based SNNs, improving
performance on challenging visual long-sequence modeling tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on the Meta-SDT variants and across object detection and
semantic segmentation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. Beyond these specific applications, we believe the proposed ST-ERF
framework can provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing SNN
architectures across a broader range of tasks. The code is available at

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: REvolution框架结合进化计算和LLMs来自动生成和优化RTL代码，通过双种群算法和自适应机制显著提高了功能正确性和PPA优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在RTL代码生成中面临的功能正确性和PPA优化挑战，克服传统迭代方法局限于局部搜索的问题。

Method: 结合进化计算与LLMs，采用双种群算法将候选设计分为失败组和成功组分别进行错误修复和PPA优化，并引入自适应机制动态调整提示策略的选择概率。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准测试中，将各种LLMs的初始通过率提高了最高24.0个百分点，DeepSeek-V3模型达到95.5%的最终通过率，且生成的RTL设计在PPA方面显著优于参考设计。

Conclusion: REvolution通过结合LLMs的生成能力和进化计算的广泛搜索能力，克服了先前方法的局部搜索限制，为RTL设计引入了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code
generation, but they face two main challenges: functional correctness and
Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) optimization. Iterative, feedback-based
methods partially address these, but they are limited to local search,
hindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution,
a framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic
RTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates
in parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and
evaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that
divides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA
optimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search
efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt
strategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and
RTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of
various LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a
final pass rate of 95.5\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the
need for separate training or domain-specific tools. Additionally, the
generated RTL designs showed significant PPA improvements over reference
designs. This work introduces a new RTL design approach by combining LLMs'
generative capabilities with EC's broad search power, overcoming the
local-search limitations of previous methods.

### [224] [Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Optimal User Order Routing: Multi-Objective Solver Optimization in CoW Protocol Batch Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21647)
*Mitchell Marfinetz*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种混合遗传算法，用于在区块链去中心化交易所路由中实时优化多目标（用户盈余、gas费用、滑点、风险），通过进化算法和确定性优化器的自适应组合，在拍卖期限内实现更好的交易路径分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的确定性单目标启发式方法在CoW协议批量拍卖中经常无法充分利用跨多个并行路径的分流机会，也难以统一处理gas费用、滑点和执行风险约束。需要一种能够进行原则性权衡的实时优化方法。

Method: 采用混合遗传算法架构，结合多目标NSGA-II引擎与自适应实例分析和确定性基线。核心引擎编码可变长度路径集和连续分流比例，在帕累托目标向量下演化候选路由和容量分配。自适应控制器在GA和基于Bellman-Ford负环检测的双重分解优化器之间选择。

Result: 在14层基准测试中，混合方法在中小订单上实现约0.40-9.82 ETH的绝对用户盈余增益，收敛中位时间约0.5秒（软上限1.0秒）。大型高碎片化订单在所有gas机制下均无利可图。系统通过8/8测试验证安全性和正确性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了首个具有端到端安全性的实时DEX路由多目标遗传算法，能够在拍卖期限内有效优化多目标权衡，显著提升用户盈余，同时保证不劣于基线性能。

Abstract: CoW Protocol batch auctions aggregate user intents and rely on solvers to
find optimal execution paths that maximize user surplus across heterogeneous
automated market makers (AMMs) under stringent auction deadlines. Deterministic
single-objective heuristics that optimize only expected output frequently fail
to exploit split-flow opportunities across multiple parallel paths and to
internalize gas, slippage, and execution risk constraints in a unified search.
We apply evolutionary multi-objective optimization to this blockchain routing
problem, proposing a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) architecture for real-time
solver optimization that combines a production-grade, multi-objective NSGA-II
engine with adaptive instance profiling and deterministic baselines. Our core
engine encodes variable-length path sets with continuous split ratios and
evolves candidate route-and-volume allocations under a Pareto objective vector
F = (user surplus, -gas, -slippage, -risk), enabling principled trade-offs and
anytime operation within the auction deadline. An adaptive controller selects
between GA and a deterministic dual-decomposition optimizer with Bellman-Ford
based negative-cycle detection, with a guarantee to never underperform the
baseline. The open-source system integrates six protection layers and passes
8/8 tests, validating safety and correctness. In a 14-stratum benchmark (30
seeds each), the hybrid approach yields absolute user-surplus gains of
approximately 0.40-9.82 ETH on small-to-medium orders, while large
high-fragmentation orders are unprofitable across gas regimes. Convergence
occurs in about 0.5 s median (soft capped at 1.0 s) within a 2-second limit. We
are not aware of an openly documented multi-objective GA with end-to-end safety
for real-time DEX routing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理系统在文献研究自动化中存在黑盒问题，输出结果看似合理但缺乏依据，研究人员难以控制和验证。需要开发透明可控的自动化研究工具。

Method: 采用四阶段统一框架：结构化知识整理、多样化想法生成、多阶段想法选择、专家小组评审与综合。系统暴露中间推理状态、执行日志和可调代理，支持跨领域应用。

Result: 在图挖掘案例研究中，系统能够生成独特、合理且有证据支持的假设，展示了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AutoResearcher提供了一个透明、可控且领域无关的自动化研究框架，能够生成多样化且基于证据的研究假设。

Abstract: Effective research relies on organizing extensive information and stimulating
novel solutions. Agentic systems have recently emerged as a promising tool to
automate literature-based ideation. However, current systems often remain
black-box. Their outputs may appear plausible but weakly grounded, with limited
transparency or control for researchers. Our work introduces
\textsc{autoresearcher}, a multi-agent demo system for knowledge-grounded and
transparent ideation. Specifically, \textsc{autoresearcher} integrates
meticulously designed four stages into a unified framework: (A) Structured
Knowledge Curation, (B) Diversified Idea Generation, (C) Multi-stage Idea
Selection, and (D) Expert Panel Review \& Synthesis. Different from prior
pipelines, our system not only exposes intermediate reasoning states, execution
logs, and tunable agents for inspections, but also enables the generation of
hypotheses that are both diverse and evidence-aligned. Our design is also
domain-agnostic: as long as literature sources exist, the same pipeline can be
instantiated in any scientific field. As an illustrative case, we demonstrate
\textsc{autoresearcher} on a graph-mining case study ($k$-truss breaking
problem), where it generates distinct, plausible hypotheses with evidence and
critiques. A live demo and source code are available at

Conclusion: ColorEcosystem为解决大规模智能体生态系统中的关键挑战提供了可行的蓝图，能够支持个性化、标准化和可信的智能体服务规模化发展。

Abstract: With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents,
the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent
systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current
massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service
experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address
these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale.
Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier,
agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service
experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while
the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing
diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of
developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both
service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional
forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across
massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of
ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让专家和非专家都能通过简单的手绘草图创建BIM模型，降低BIM创建的技术门槛。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型的多智能体框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图迭代优化为结构化JSON布局，再转换为可执行脚本生成3D模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上测试，门、窗等开口元素在初次处理中就能高可靠捕获，墙体检测从83%开始，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐。所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过0.83，几何误差通过反馈修正逐步降至零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多智能体推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都变得可访问，仅需使用手绘草图即可完成。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在开放领域创意生成中，要么陷入熟悉的文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术品中共同出现的可能性，文化背景模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术学生表现相当；定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化的输出和更广泛的概念空间探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化可以解锁自主代理的创意潜力，在保持内部一致性的同时生成新颖创意。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模糊数表示方法——外延模糊数，以解决传统模糊数运算中的计算复杂性和结果特性改变等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在三个主要问题：高计算复杂度、运算结果可能改变模糊集特性（如两个三角模糊数相乘结果不再是三角模糊数）、以及模糊扩散问题（运算次数增加导致模糊性增加）。这些问题限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 采用外延模糊数（extensional fuzzy numbers）作为新的表示方法，定义了外延模糊数的运算操作和关系运算符（=, >, >=, <, <=）。

Result: 提出的方法通过多个应用示例进行了说明，并提供了C++实现的公开GitHub代码库。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数方法能够有效克服传统模糊数运算的局限性，为模糊数的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了何时应该优先采纳AI输出而非人类专家判断，提出了AI优先主义观点及其替代方案——全证据观点，认为AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类独立认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于社会认识论，探讨AI系统作为人工认识权威的地位，以及如何合理地在AI输出和人类判断之间进行权衡，特别是在高风险情境下。

Method: 通过分析AI优先主义观点及其经典反对意见，发展出全证据观点作为替代方案，强调AI输出应作为贡献性理由整合到人类认知过程中。

Result: 提出了全证据观点，该观点具有三个关键优势：缓解专业知识萎缩、为人有意义监督提供认识论依据、解释AI可靠性不足时的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 全证据观点为确定何时合理采纳AI提供了原则性方法，特别是在需要严格可靠性的高风险情境中，虽然实践要求较高，但提供了更合理的AI遵从框架。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制，限制了其适应性和可信度。

Method: 采用导演协调的三阶段方法：工具调用（通过证据驱动验证器验证输出）、诊断规划（组建专家团队）、协作决策（整合专家见解和上下文记忆）。

Result: 在各种CXR解释任务上的实验表明，CXRAgent表现强劲，能提供视觉证据，并能很好地泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR分析的适应性、可信度和诊断能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体框架，用于将自然语言问题准确翻译为空间SQL查询，通过专业化的智能体协作和程序化验证来提高空间查询的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SQL复杂性和PostGIS等工具中地理空间函数的专业性带来的障碍，让非专家也能进行空间数据分析。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成和审查智能体，结合知识库、模式分析和语义增强技术。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%准确率，在空间查询测试中达到87.7%准确率，比没有审查智能体时提高了11个百分点。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更易访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了稳健且可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要关注技术属性（可靠性、鲁棒性、公平性），而忽视了理解真实世界AI可信度所需的社会技术维度，需要全面审视AIES和FAccT社区如何概念化、测量和验证AI可信度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度在不同研究领域中的定义、操作化和应用，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 研究发现虽然透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性的定义取得显著进展，但当前研究往往过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质探索不足，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的争议概念。

Conclusion: 需要结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法推进可信AI，为AI伦理社区提出采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的整体框架的可操作措施。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

TL;DR: MedAlign是一个用于医学视觉问答的新框架，通过多模态直接偏好优化、检索感知专家混合架构和联邦治理机制，解决大型视觉语言模型在医疗应用中的幻觉、推理效率和多机构协作问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在医疗临床服务部署中面临三个关键挑战：产生无视觉依据的幻觉答案、固定深度推理的低效性、以及多机构协作的困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化(mDPO)目标，设计检索感知专家混合(RA-MoE)架构，并采用联邦治理机制实现自适应推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上达到最先进性能，比强检索增强基线F1分数提升高达11.85%，平均推理长度比固定深度CoT方法减少51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign框架有效解决了LVLM在医疗应用中的关键挑战，实现了视觉准确、高效且支持多机构协作的医学视觉问答。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效处理观测数据中的混杂偏差，在存在未观测混杂的情况下提供鲁棒的离策略学习

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

Motivation: 恐慌发作需要及时干预，但缺乏合适的训练数据集，存在伦理和后勤问题。

Method: 引入PACE数据集，包含第一人称叙述的高危情境，基于心理急救原则训练PACER模型，使用监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化。

Result: PACER在咨询师侧指标和客户情感改善方面优于强基线，在恐慌场景中持续优于通用、CBT和GPT-4模型。

Conclusion: PACER模型在恐慌发作干预中具有实用价值，代码已开源。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

TL;DR: 提出NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，在RAG系统中实现高效知识投毒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG投毒攻击主要关注检索内容或提示结构，忽视了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未研究知识冲突机制。

Method: 首先识别与上下文投毒知识强相关的毒害响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过归因信号重用有潜力的知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上实验，持续实现超过90%的人口覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性，有效解决知识冲突。

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning框架通过神经元级攻击有效实现RAG系统投毒，揭示了模型内部表示动态在知识冲突中的关键作用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

Motivation: 在现实应用中，为大型语言模型设计针对领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性，需要解决领域知识整合、推理效率提升等关键问题。

Method: 提出EGO-Prompt框架，从专家构建的初始语义因果图出发，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程分两步优化：生成确定性推理指导，并让LLM有效利用该指导。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务上，EGO-Prompt比前沿方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，小模型能以不到20%成本达到大模型性能，并输出可解释的领域特定语义因果图。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt有效解决了领域特定提示设计问题，显著提升LLM性能同时降低成本，并提供更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随(PIF)任务上表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏。

Method: 提出SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵值，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵循特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLM的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够解决LLM在概率指令跟随任务中的偏见问题，提高输出多样性，适用于各种需要非确定性行为的应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署中，预训练视觉语言模型面临环境变化和新类别出现，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应变化同时避免遗忘。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已有知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准上获得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL是实际可扩展的解决方案，适用于现实世界中不断演化的零样本视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Shylock方法有效解决了多变量时间序列因果关系发现中的数据稀缺和过拟合问题，并开发了Tcausal库便于使用。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在三个关键限制：数据集多样性和类别覆盖不足、用户模拟不真实、评估指标不准确，需要建立一个更全面、真实的专业外呼场景评估标准。

Method: 1) 设计涵盖6大业务领域和30个子场景的基准测试，包含场景特定流程分解、加权评分和领域自适应指标；2) 开发大模型驱动的用户模拟器，生成多样化、角色丰富的虚拟用户；3) 引入动态评估方法，结合自动化和人工评估。

Conclusion: OutboundEval为专业应用中大语言模型的基准测试建立了一个实用、可扩展且面向领域的标准。

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI自主系统能力的扩展，证明其安全性变得至关重要但具有挑战性，需要能够处理系统生命周期中新颖和不确定情况的鲁棒方法，包括检测OOD数据。

Method: 通过全面综述分析OOD检测技术，定义相关概念，调查OOD产生原因，探讨自主系统安全保证和OOD检测的挑战因素。

Result: 识别了可在ML开发生命周期中使用的多种技术，并建议了在生命周期中支持安全论证的应用领域，讨论了系统集成OOD检测时的注意事项。

Conclusion: 概述了跨领域自主系统安全开发和运营面临的挑战及未来研究方向。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

### [247] [Investigating Scale Independent UCT Exploration Factor Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21275)
*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出并评估了多种自适应选择UCT探索常数λ的策略，使其对游戏奖励尺度具有鲁棒性。推荐使用新策略λ=2σ，其中σ是搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，许多游戏具有密集奖励和手动选择的奖励尺度，导致不同游戏中节点的Q值跨越不同量级。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的λ策略以及五种新策略，包括选择λ作为搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值经验标准差的倍数。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ策略在广泛任务中优于现有λ策略，无论是单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数获得的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用新策略λ=2σ，该方法对游戏奖励尺度具有鲁棒性且在多种任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合符号验证和交互验证的神经符号具身任务规划框架，通过在代码生成过程中加入环境探索来增强环境感知，显著提高了动态和部分可观测环境中的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境感知不足的问题，导致代码生成不准确或不完整，影响任务成功率。

Method: 提出神经符号具身任务规划框架，包含显式符号验证和交互验证过程。验证阶段生成探索性代码与环境主动交互，获取缺失观测同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观测场景中评估，相比Code-as-Policies基线任务成功率提升46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强生成代码的环境感知能力，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

### [249] [When Models Outthink Their Safety: Mitigating Self-Jailbreak in Large Reasoning Models with Chain-of-Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21285)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)训练框架，通过重新组合或回溯不安全的推理步骤，在保持有效推理链的同时引导模型回到安全轨迹，显著提升大型推理模型的安全性而不损害推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往会抑制推理能力，无法解决安全与推理之间的权衡问题。

Method: 分析多种大型推理模型的推理轨迹，发现自我越狱现象，即模型会覆盖自身的风险评估并为响应不安全提示辩护。基于此提出Chain-of-Guardrail训练框架，重新组合或回溯不安全推理步骤。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提升了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型本身具备拒绝不安全查询的能力，但这种能力被削弱导致有害输出。CoG框架通过引导模型回到安全轨迹，有效解决了安全与推理之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用模仿学习训练神经控制屏障函数的方法，无需显式指定失败状态集，通过专家演示数据学习安全约束，在四个环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全是基本要求。传统方法需要明确指定失败状态集，但实际中失败状态往往难以形式化描述，而专家演示数据更容易获得。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或危险，然后用该函数标注模拟轨迹数据来训练神经控制屏障函数。

Result: 在四个不同环境中的实证评估表明，该方法优于现有基线方法，性能接近使用真实安全标签训练的神经控制屏障函数。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的安全约束学习方法，无需显式指定失败状态集，为自主系统的安全控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [251] [Magellan: Guided MCTS for Latent Space Exploration and Novelty Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21341)
*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

TL;DR: 提出结合强化学习(RL)的框架，提升1.5B模型在数学推理中的性能，相比仅使用监督微调(SFT)的方法，在GSM8K数据集上准确率更高且token使用量减少40%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预算强制(budget forcing)等测试时缩放方法虽然计算效率高且参数无关，但依赖长上下文推理轨迹的SFT会导致小模型性能下降，因为产生冗长响应。

Method: 整合强化学习到框架中，仅使用1.5K训练样本，通过SFT+RL方法提升token效率并增强数学推理性能。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，整体准确率更高，token使用量相比SFT模型减少超过40%。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以弥补长上下文训练带来的损失，整体提升数学推理性能，特别是在小模型上效果显著。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域表现出色但缺乏透明度，现有神经符号AI方法主要针对传统神经网络，不适合LLMs的独特特性，需要系统性的符号集成方法。

Conclusion: 通过突出最新发展和文献中的显著差距，为未来研究提供了路线图，并为实现LLMs透明度增强的符号集成框架提供了实用见解。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架能够有效自动化优化问题的求解过程，减少人工干预，在复杂问题上表现出色。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Result: 在多个VRP变体上的广泛实验表明MoSES优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoSES框架通过复用基础求解器有效解决了多任务VRP问题，展示了在共享组件结构感知方面的优势。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)框架，通过引入衡量自我改进潜力的CMP指标来解决编码代理自我改进潜力与基准性能不匹配的问题，在SWE-bench等数据集上实现了超越现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码代理的自我改进方法基于软件工程基准性能来选择后续修改，但作者发现代理的自我改进潜力（元生产力）与其编码基准性能之间存在不匹配问题。

Method: 提出CMP指标来聚合代理后代的基准性能作为自我改进潜力指标，并基于此构建Huxley-Gödel Machine框架，通过估计CMP来指导自我修改树的搜索。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot数据集上，HGM优于先前的自我改进编码代理开发方法，同时使用更少的挂钟时间，并在其他编码数据集和大型语言模型上表现出强迁移性。

Conclusion: HGM框架通过正确估计自我改进潜力，实现了人类水平的编码代理性能，匹配了人工工程编码代理的最佳官方验证结果。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

TL;DR: DeepAgent是一个端到端的深度推理智能体，通过自主思考、工具发现和行动执行在单一连贯推理过程中完成任务。它采用自主记忆折叠机制压缩交互历史，并使用ToolPO强化学习策略高效学习通用工具使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体框架通常遵循预定义工作流程，限制了自主性和全局任务完成能力。现实世界任务需要外部工具和长程交互，但多工具调用会导致上下文长度爆炸和交互历史累积问题。

Method: 提出自主记忆折叠机制，将过去交互压缩为结构化记忆（情景记忆、工作记忆、工具记忆），减少错误累积同时保留关键信息。开发ToolPO端到端强化学习策略，利用LLM模拟API并通过工具调用优势归因对工具调用token分配细粒度信用。

Result: 在8个基准测试（包括通用工具使用任务和下游应用）上的广泛实验表明，DeepAgent在标记工具和开放集工具检索场景中均持续优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作朝着为现实世界应用构建更通用和更有能力的智能体迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code
and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理评估基准存在不足：缺乏真实科学研究的整体评估、缺少可复现的代理工具、未考虑模型成本和工具访问等混杂变量、缺乏标准化接口和全面基线代理。

Method: 定义基准原则和工具，开发AstaBench套件，包含覆盖整个科学发现过程的2400+问题，提供生产级搜索工具的科学研究环境，以及9类科学优化代理和多个基线。

Result: 评估了57个代理和22个代理类别，发现尽管在某些方面有进展，但AI在科学研究辅助方面仍远未解决挑战。

Conclusion: 需要更严谨的基准来评估AI科学代理，AstaBench提供了首个整体科学能力评估框架，揭示了当前AI在科学研究辅助方面的局限性。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需对目标本体或实体数量设限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来将数据完全语境化到特定领域。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成。

Method: 采用检索增强生成方法选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中评估，CMOMgen在类选择方面优于基线方法，在两个任务中F1分数至少达到63%，优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，46%的非参考映射获得最高评分，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态基准数据集，专门分析能源公司公关广告中的框架类型，特别是绿色创新等环境信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业公关活动存在言行不一的问题，如石油公司的'漂绿'现象。需要大规模理解框架类型及其变化来分析公关活动的目标和性质。

Method: 构建专家标注的视频广告数据集，包含13种框架类型，覆盖50多家公司和20个国家，专门用于评估视觉语言模型。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息达到79% F1分数，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架上仅达46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源部门战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时揭示了视觉语言模型在处理隐含框架、不同长度视频和隐含文化背景方面的挑战。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时，高层任务目标与低层规划输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 引入以知识图谱为核心的框架，采用双平面架构将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，将任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 通过墨西哥湾自主水下航行器的案例研究，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同声明性策略能产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于越野自动驾驶的运行时安全保障监控器，通过Bekker成本模型和不确定性边界来确保车辆在不确定土壤条件下的安全运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野自动驾驶需要操作约束来确保在土壤强度不确定的情况下行为保持可预测和安全。

Method: 使用基于Bekker的成本模型构建置信上限遍历成本，通过轻量级压力沉陷模型检查计划运动是否超过最大沉陷和侧翻裕度限制，当风险过高时切换到认证后备方案。

Result: 在从壤土到沙地的仿真环境中测试了干预率、违规概率和路径效率，并通过静态加载测试进行了初步实证验证。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分离规划器和监控器，让规划器专注于效率，而监控器在运行时保持车辆在明确的安全限制内。

Abstract: Reliable off-road autonomy requires operational constraints so that behavior
stays predictable and safe when soil strength is uncertain. This paper presents
a runtime assurance safety monitor that collaborates with any planner and uses
a Bekker-based cost model with bounded uncertainty. The monitor builds an upper
confidence traversal cost from a lightweight pressure sinkage model identified
in field tests and checks each planned motion against two limits: maximum
sinkage and rollover margin. If the risk of crossing either limit is too high,
the monitor switches to a certified fallback that reduces vehicle speed,
increases standoff from soft ground, or stops on firmer soil. This separation
lets the planner focus on efficiency while the monitor keeps the vehicle within
clear safety limits on board. Wheel geometry, wheel load estimate, and a soil
raster serve as inputs, which tie safety directly to vehicle design and let the
monitor set clear limits on speed, curvature, and stopping at run time. The
method carries uncertainty analytically into the upper confidence cost and
applies simple intervention rules. Tuning of the sinkage limit, rollover
margin, and risk window trades efficiency for caution while keeping the monitor
light enough for embedded processors. Results from a simulation environment
spanning loam to sand include intervention rates, violation probability, and
path efficiency relative to the nominal plan, and a benchtop static loading
check provides initial empirical validation.

Conclusion: 所提出的鲁棒DAPI控制方案能够有效解决微电网网络中的频率和电压调节问题，特别是在面对运行扰动和网络攻击时表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The transition towards clean energy and the introduction of Distributed
Energy Resources (DERs) are giving rise to the emergence of Microgrids (MGs)
and Networks of MGs (NMGs). MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded
mode. However, they face challenges in terms of secondary level frequency and
voltage regulation, due to the variable nature of Renewable Energy Sources
(RES) and loads. Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control has
been proposed in the literature for distributed frequency and voltage control
of droop-controlled DERs, but it is not robust to operational or structural
perturbations. To address this, we propose a robust DAPI frequency and voltage
control scheme that ensures robustness using the concept of connective
stability, along with the invariant ellipsoid technique for disturbance
rejection. Simulation of an NMG model in
MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}/Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
consisting of 3 MGs and 5 DERs validates the effectiveness of the proposed
method, and demonstrates that it can successfully mitigate the effects of major
disturbances such as cyberattacks.

Conclusion: 该工作为选择计算效率高且对运行条件鲁棒的房屋热模型提供了系统方法，支持HVAC系统参与需求响应的实际应用。

Abstract: Achieving the flexibility from house heating, cooling, and ventilation
systems (HVAC) has the potential to enable large-scale demand response by
aggregating HVAC load adjustments across many homes. This demand response
strategy helps distribution grid to flexibly ramp-up or ramp-down local load
demand so that it can optimally match the bulk power system generation profile.
However, achieving this capability requires house thermal models that are both
computationally efficient and robust to operating conditions. In this work,
parameters of the Resistance-Capacitance (RC) network thermal model for houses
are estimated using three optimization algorithms: Nonlinear Least Squares
(NLS), Batch Estimation (BE), and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The
resulting models are evaluated through a Forward-Simulation across four
different seasons and three setpoints. The results illustrate a principled way
of selecting reduced order models and estimation methods with respect to the
robustness offered to seasonal and setpoint variations in training-testing
datasets

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box function approximators
which have been shown to yield improved performance compared to traditional
neural network (NN) architectures. However, black-box algorithms do not
incorporate known physics of the system and can yield results which are
physically implausible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in
popularity due to their ability to leverage known physical principles in the
learning process which has been empirically shown to improve performance
compared to traditional black-box methods. This paper introduces the first
physics-informed DNN controller for an Euler-Lagrange dynamic system where the
adaptation laws are designed using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis to
account for the skew-symmetry property of the inertia matrix and
centripetal-Coriolis matrix. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to
guarantee asymptotic convergence of the tracking error and the skew-symmetric
prediction error. Simulations indicate that the developed update law
demonstrates improvement in individual and overall function approximation
capabilities when compared to a physics-informed adaptation law which does not
incorporate knowledge of system symmetries.

Motivation: 随着BTM资源的渗透率增加，需要监控这些资源的组件并推断其对外部环境的响应行为。但由于数据隐私问题，设备级测量对电力系统运营商不可见，阻碍了负荷识别的准确建模。

Method: 采用双层迭代求解框架，开发了数据驱动的逆优化算法来识别储能类组件的参数，提出了物理启发模型来识别其余组件的容量和响应。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了BTM组件识别问题，为电力系统运营商提供了无需设备级测量的负荷分解方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of behind-the-meter (BTM) resources, it is
vital to monitor the components of these resources and deduce their response
behavior to external environment. Owing to data privacy, however, the
appliance-wise measurement is invisible to the power system operator, which
hinders the accurate modeling of load identification. To this end, this paper
proposes a hybrid physics-inspired and data-driven framework for decomposing
BTM components based on external measurement of total load and environmental
factors. The total load is decomposed into different environment-dependent
components, namely storage-like component, PV generation component,
thermostatically-controlled load component, and periodic component. The overall
load identification adopts a double-layer iterative solution framework. A
data-driven inverse optimization algorithm is developed to identify parameters
of the energy storage-like component. The physics-inspired model is proposed to
identify the capacity and response of the rest components. The modeling
accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated by numerical
tests. The application significance of the proposed BTM identification method
is also validated in electricity market clearing for reducing system operation
costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖静态技术经济模型，忽视了参与者互动、基础设施限制和监管复杂性，需要动态评估不同运营策略在真实能源市场条件下的可行性。

Method: 使用基于代理模拟与多标准决策的建模框架，在丹麦案例中应用三种运营策略（仅电网、仅现场、混合）和三种电解槽容量水平（10MW、50MW、100MW），结合真实电价、排放因子和市场数据。

Conclusion: 该框架通过建模动态参与者互动和集成系统性能评估，为能源规划者和政策制定者在可再生能源丰富背景下设计弹性和高效的Power-to-X系统提供可行见解。

Abstract: The transition toward net-zero energy systems requires scalable and
cost-effective deployment of Power-to-X technologies, particularly green
hydrogen production. Despite increasing investments, a critical research gap
remains in dynamically assessing how different operational strategies affect
the feasibility of hydrogen production under real-world energy market
conditions. Most existing studies rely on static, techno-economic models and
overlook actor interactions, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory
complexity. This paper presents a novel modeling framework that integrates
agent-based simulation with multi-criteria decision-making to evaluate green
hydrogen production strategies using co-located wind and solar generation.
Three operational strategies - grid-only, on-site-only, and hybrid - are
applied across three electrolyzer capacity levels (10 MW, 50 MW, and 100 MW)
within a Danish case study. Real electricity tariffs, emissions factors, and
market data are used to simulate technical, economic, and environmental
performance indicators. The results show that hybrid strategies consistently
outperform grid-only configurations in terms of cost and emissions while
maintaining stable hydrogen output. Although on-site-only strategies minimize
emissions and costs, they fail to meet fixed production demands. This framework
offers novel scientific contributions by modeling dynamic actor interactions
and integrating system performance evaluation into strategic planning.
Practically, it provides actionable insights for energy planners and
policymakers designing resilient and efficient Power-to-X systems in
renewable-rich contexts.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Data Injections Attacks (DIAs) critically depends on the
completeness of the system information accessible to adversaries. This
relationship positions information incompleteness enhancement as a vital
defense strategy for degrading DIA performance. In this paper, we focus on the
information-theoretic stealth attacks, where the attacker encounters a
fundamental tradeoff between the attack stealthiness and destructiveness.
Specifically, we systematically characterize how incomplete admittance
information impacts the dual objectives. In particular, we establish sufficient
conditions for two distinct operational regimes: (i) stealthiness intensifies
while destructive potential diminishes and (ii) destructiveness increases while
stealth capability weakens. For scenarios beyond these regimes, we propose a
maximal incompleteness strategy to optimally degrade stealth capability. To
solve the associated optimization problem, the feasible region is reduced
without excluding the optimal solution, and a heuristic algorithm is then
introduced to effectively identify the near-optimal solutions within the
reduced region. Numerical simulations are conducted on IEEE test systems to
validate the findings.

Abstract: As communication networks evolve towards greater complexity (e.g., 6G and
beyond), a deep understanding of the wireless environment becomes increasingly
crucial. When explicit knowledge of the environment is unavailable,
geometry-aware feature extraction from channel state information (CSI) emerges
as a pivotal methodology to bridge physical-layer measurements with network
intelligence. This paper proposes to explore the received signal strength (RSS)
data, without explicit 3D environment knowledge, to jointly construct the radio
beam map and environmental geometry for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
system. Unlike existing methods that only learn blockage structures, we propose
an oriented virtual obstacle model that captures the geometric features of both
blockage and reflection. Reflective zones are formulated to identify relevant
reflected paths according to the geometry relation of the environment. We
derive an analytical expression for the reflective zone and further analyze its
geometric characteristics to develop a reformulation that is more compatible
with deep learning representations. A physics-informed deep learning framework
that incorporates the reflective-zone-based geometry model is proposed to learn
the blockage, reflection, and scattering components, along with the beam
pattern, which leverages physics prior knowledge to enhance network
transferability. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to
reconstructing the blockage and reflection geometry, the proposed model can
construct a more accurate MIMO beam map with a 32%-48% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将Koopman算子理论与分布鲁棒优化相结合，为非线性随机系统的约束控制问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven stochastic MPC design for
discrete-time nonlinear systems with additive disturbances by leveraging the
Koopman operator and a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. By
lifting the dynamical system into a linear space, we achieve a
finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. We explicitly account
for the modeling approximation and additive disturbance error by a mixed
stochastic-deterministic tube for the lifted linear model. This ensures the
regulation of the original nonlinear system while complying with the
prespecified constraints. Stochastic and deterministic tubes are constructed
using a DRO and a hyper-cube hull, respectively. We provide finite sample error
bounds for both types of tubes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Obtaining control barrier functions (CBFs) with large safe sets for complex
nonlinear systems and constraints is a challenging task. Predictive CBFs
address this issue by using an online finite-horizon optimal control problem
that implicitly defines a large safe set. The optimal control problem, also
known as the predictive safety filter (PSF), involves predicting the system's
flow under a given backup control policy. However, for non-smooth systems and
constraints, some key elements, such as CBF gradients and the sensitivity of
the flow, are not well-defined, making the current methods inadequate for
ensuring safety. Additionally, for control-non-affine systems, the PSF is
generally nonlinear and non-convex, posing challenges for real-time
computation. This paper considers piecewise affine systems, which are usually
control-non-affine, under nonlinear state and polyhedral input constraints. We
solve the safety issue by incorporating set-valued generalized Clarke
derivatives in the PSF design. We show that enforcing CBF constraints across
all elements of the generalized Clarke derivatives suffices to guarantee
safety. Moreover, to lighten the computational overhead, we propose an explicit
approximation of the PSF. The resulting control methods are demonstrated
through numerical examples.

Conclusion: 拍卖式责任分配机制有效解决了多智能体安全约束的可扩展性问题，在保证完全安全覆盖的同时显著减少计算复杂度。

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable decentralized safety filter for multi-agent
systems based on high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs) and
auction-based responsibility allocation. While decentralized HOCBF formulations
ensure pairwise safety under input bounds, they face feasibility and
scalability challenges as the number of agents grows. Each agent must evaluate
an increasing number of pairwise constraints, raising the risk of infeasibility
and making it difficult to meet real-time requirements. To address this, we
introduce an auction-based allocation scheme that distributes constraint
enforcement asymmetrically among neighbors based on local control effort
estimates. The resulting directed responsibility graph guarantees full safety
coverage while reducing redundant constraints and per-agent computational load.
Simulation results confirm safe and efficient coordination across a range of
network sizes and interaction densities.

Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibria are used in multi-agent control applications to
model strategic interactions between agents that are coupled in the cost,
dynamics, and constraints. We study the properties of open-loop GNE
trajectories from a system-theoretic perspective. We show how strict
dissipativity generates the turnpike phenomenon in GNE solutions. Moreover, we
establish a converse turnpike result, i.e., the implication from turnpike to
strict dissipativity. We derive conditions under which the steady-state GNE is
the optimal operating point and, using a game value function, we give a local
characterization of the geometry of storage functions. Finally, we design
linear terminal penalties that ensure GNE open-loop trajectories converge to
and remain at the steady-state GNE. These connections provide the foundation
for future system-theoretic analysis of GNEs similar to those existing in
optimal control.

Abstract: This paper focuses on rate-limited control of the generalized
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process where the control action can be either
multiplicative or additive, and the noise variance can depend on the control
action. We derive a lower bound on the data rate necessary to achieve the
desired control cost. The lower bound is attained with equality if the control
is performed via an additive white Gaussian channel. The system model
approximates the dynamics of a discrete-state molecular birth-death process,
and the result has direct implications on the control of a biomolecular system
via chemical reactions, where the multiplicative control corresponds to the
degradation rate, the additive control corresponds to the production rate, and
the control objective is to decrease the fluctuations of the controlled
molecular species around their desired concentration levels.
