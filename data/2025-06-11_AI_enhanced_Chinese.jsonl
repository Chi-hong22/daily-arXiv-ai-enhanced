To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional\nVital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any\ntarget waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or\narterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single\nmodel. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin\nTransformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture\ndistinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct\nmulti-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets.
