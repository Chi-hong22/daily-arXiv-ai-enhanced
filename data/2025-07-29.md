TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应伽马校正（TAGC）的低光照图像增强模型，自动计算伽马值以提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照条件下图像质量下降，表现为低对比度、噪声和细节模糊，需高效增强方法。

Method: 通过分析图像颜色亮度和平均颜色，自适应计算伽马系数，无需人工干预。

Result: TAGC模型有效提升图像质量，保持细节、自然对比度和正确色彩分布。

Conclusion: TAGC是一种高效的低光照图像增强解决方案，适用于监控、医学图像和摄影等领域。

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

### [2] [Is Exchangeability better than I.I.D to handle Data Distribution Shifts while Pooling Data for Data-scarce Medical image segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19575)
*Ayush Roy,Samin Enam,Jun Xia,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Won Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一种方法，通过控制深度学习网络中前景-背景特征的差异，解决医学图像分割中的数据稀缺和分布偏移问题，并在多个数据集上取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像数据稀缺，数据合并或增加可能导致分布偏移（Data Addition Dilemma），影响模型性能。

Method: 利用因果框架控制深度学习网络中前景-背景特征的差异，优化特征表示。

Result: 在五个数据集（包括新贡献的超声数据集）上实现最佳分割性能，定性结果显示更精细的分割图。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据稀缺和分布偏移问题，提升了医学图像分割的准确性。

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

### [3] [T-MPEDNet: Unveiling the Synergy of Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder Network with Feature Recalibration for Tumor and Liver Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19590)
*Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw,Jasmer Singh Sanjotra,Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Shubhi Bansal,Shahid Shafi Dar,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的Transformer感知多尺度渐进编码器-解码器网络（T-MPEDNet），用于CT扫描中肝脏和肿瘤的自动分割，解决了肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝脏和肿瘤的精确自动分割对快速诊断和制定治疗计划至关重要，但现有方法面临肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性的挑战。

Method: T-MPEDNet采用渐进编码器-解码器结构，结合动态注意力机制和多尺度特征利用，并通过形态学边界细化优化分割结果。

Result: 在LiTS和3DIRCADb数据集上，T-MPEDNet的肝脏和肿瘤分割DSC分别达到97.6%/89.1%和98.3%/83.3%，优于12种先进方法。

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet是一种高效可靠的肝脏和肿瘤自动分割框架。

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

### [4] [SurgPIS: Surgical-instrument-level Instances and Part-level Semantics for Weakly-supervised Part-aware Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19592)
*Meng Wei,Charlie Budd,Oluwatosin Alabi,Miaojing Shi,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgPIS提出了一种统一的部分感知实例分割方法，通过Transformer和弱监督学习解决手术器械分割问题，并在多个数据集上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理器械级实例分割和部分级语义分割，缺乏任务间交互，限制了自动化手术的准确性。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的掩码分类方法，引入部分特定查询，并通过弱监督学习从部分标记数据中训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了SurgPIS的有效性，实现了在部分感知实例分割及其他任务上的最优性能。

Conclusion: SurgPIS通过统一任务和弱监督学习，显著提升了手术器械分割的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

### [5] [Local Prompt Adaptation for Style-Consistent Multi-Object Generation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20094)
*Ankit Sanjyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA)的无训练架构方法，通过分解提示词为内容和风格标记，选择性注入U-Net的注意力层，提升布局控制和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在复杂提示下生成场景时缺乏风格一致性和空间连贯性，限制了可控内容生成的实用性。

Method: 将提示词分解为内容和风格标记，分阶段选择性注入U-Net的注意力层。

Result: 在CLIP分数和风格一致性指标上优于现有方法（如Composer、MultiDiffusion等）。

Conclusion: LPA为可控、表达性强的扩散生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种支持多模态交互的VideoLLM模型，通过STOM模块实现视觉提示的时空传播，并构建了VideoInfer数据集，实验表明其在视频问答和分割任务中优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VideoLLM模型局限于文本响应，缺乏对象中心的多轮交互灵活性。

Method: 引入支持对象引用和视觉提示的VideoLLM模型，提出STOM模块实现视觉提示的时空传播，构建VideoInfer数据集。

Result: 在12个基准测试的6项任务中，模型在视频问答和分割任务中均优于基线。

Conclusion: 该模型在多模态、对象中心的视频理解中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

*Sheethal Bhat,Bogdan Georgescu,Adarsh Bhandary Panambur,Mathias Zinnen,Tri-Thien Nguyen,Awais Mansoor,Karim Khalifa Elbarbary,Siming Bayer,Florin-Cristian Ghesu,Sasa Grbic,Andreas Maier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Exemplar Med-DETR，一种多模态对比检测器，通过跨注意力和迭代训练策略，在多种医学影像模态中实现最先进的异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中异常检测的挑战在于特征表示差异和复杂解剖结构关系，现有方法难以学习有效的类别特定特征。

Method: 引入Exemplar Med-DETR，利用跨注意力与直观类别特定示例特征，采用迭代训练策略。

Result: 在四种公共数据集上表现优异，如越南密集乳腺钼靶中肿块检测mAP达0.7，中国外部分布数据性能提升两倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动医学影像中鲁棒且通用的检测系统发展。

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

TL;DR: MIST是一个模块化医学图像分割工具包，特别针对BraTS 2025挑战赛优化了后处理框架，支持多种自定义操作，提升了分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割缺乏标准化工具，难以进行方法比较。

Method: 扩展了MIST的后处理模块，支持多种变换（如小对象移除、形态学操作等），并可组合成用户定义策略。

Result: 评估了三种策略，展示了MIST在快速实验和精细调整中的优势。

Conclusion: MIST是开源且可扩展的工具，支持医学图像分割的可重复研究。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了内窥镜深度估计领域的全面参考，并指出了领域适应、实时实现和模型泛化等未来方向。

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决疼痛评估中因数据集缺乏多样性（如种族、年龄）和隐私限制导致的临床部署困难。

Method: 使用生成式AI工具创建包含不同种族、年龄和性别的合成疼痛表情数据集，并通过临床验证工具评估其有效性。

Result: 合成数据展示了预期的疼痛模式，显著高于中性表情，并揭示了现有疼痛检测模型的算法偏见。数据增强还提高了真实临床数据的检测性能。

Conclusion: SynPAIN填补了疼痛评估研究的空白，提供了首个公开的多样化合成数据集，并建立了检测和减轻算法偏见的框架。

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在电子商务中因标注成本高而面临的规模挑战。

Method: 使用PEFT训练低秩适配器模块，通过DPO利用未标记数据生成偏好链并微调模型。

Result: 在12个电子商务垂直领域的数据集上，DPO微调显著优于监督模型，且性能随未标记数据增加而提升。

Conclusion: DPO结合未标记数据可高效提升模型性能，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Result: DeepJIVE成功揭示了多模态数据的联合和个体变化，并在ADNI数据中发现了生物学上合理的协变模式。

Conclusion: DeepJIVE是多模态数据分析的有用工具。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Conclusion: Co-Win提升了自动驾驶系统的下游决策和规划能力。

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为分析合成人脸检测器的偏见提供了有效工具，并强调了数据平衡和检测机制对偏见的影响。

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

Conclusion: uQRPCA+通过高效计算和统一框架，显著提升了彩色视频中目标分割和背景恢复的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

TL;DR: 论文研究了在RAFT-Stereo框架中引入LiDAR引导以提高立体匹配精度，发现稀疏LiDAR点会显著降低效果，并提出了一种基于信号处理的解释和简单解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过LiDAR深度信息提升立体匹配精度，尤其是在LiDAR点稀疏的情况下。

Method: 提出预填充稀疏初始视差图的插值方法，并结合早期融合的LiDAR深度注入。

Result: 提出的GRAFT-Stereo方法在稀疏LiDAR条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为LiDAR引导的立体匹配方法提供了新思路和解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LOMM的方法，通过最新对象记忆（LOM）和解耦对象关联（DOA）策略，显著提升了视频实例分割的长期跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频实例分割中长期实例跟踪的挑战，尤其是在动态场景中对象频繁出现和消失的情况下。

Method: 使用LOM显式建模对象在每帧中的存在状态，并通过DOA策略分别处理新出现和已存在的对象。

Result: 在YouTube-VIS 2022数据集上取得了54.0的AP分数，性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LOMM方法在视频实例分割中实现了长期一致的跟踪和准确的标识管理，为VIS领域设立了新的基准。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新任务——人脸修饰恢复（FRR），旨在从修饰后的人脸图像中恢复原始人脸。作者提出了一种混合扩散模型（MoFRR），通过稀疏激活的专家模型处理不同类型的修饰，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交平台上广泛使用的人脸修饰技术引发了关于图像真实性的担忧，现有方法仅关注检测修饰，而恢复原始人脸的任务尚未解决。

Method: 提出MoFRR模型，结合专用专家和共享专家处理不同修饰类型，采用双分支结构（低频分支和高频分支）进行恢复。

Result: 在RetouchingFFHQ++数据集上的实验表明，MoFRR在人脸修饰恢复任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MoFRR通过混合专家模型有效解决了复杂修饰操作的恢复问题，为人脸图像真实性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

Motivation: 尽管MAE在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其学习机制尚未完全明确。本文旨在揭示MAE的内在学习模式，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过深入分析发现MAE早期即学习补丁级聚类，基于此提出自引导掩码生成方法，替代随机掩码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了学习效率，且无需依赖外部模型或额外信息。

Conclusion: 自引导MAE在保持自监督优势的同时，显著提升了性能，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: HydraMamba提出了一种基于状态空间模型的点云网络，通过改进点云序列化和局部学习，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个任务上实现了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力机制在点云学习中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了长距离依赖建模。状态空间模型（S6）具有线性复杂度，但现有方法在点云序列化和局部学习方面仍有不足。

Method: 设计了shuffle序列化策略以适应S6的因果性；提出ConvBiS6层结合局部几何与全局上下文；扩展多头设计为MHS6增强建模能力。

Result: HydraMamba在对象级和场景级任务中均取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: HydraMamba通过改进序列化和局部学习，有效解决了长距离依赖建模问题，为点云学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

Motivation: 大气湍流导致图像质量下降，影响目标检测性能，现有方法计算复杂度高且效率低。

Method: 提出JDATT框架，结合特征级（CWD和MGD）和输出级（KL散度）蒸馏策略，联合优化湍流抑制和目标检测。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，JDATT在视觉恢复和检测精度上表现优异，同时显著减少模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: JDATT是一种高效且轻量化的解决方案，适用于实时湍流抑制和目标检测任务。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频显著目标检测依赖运动线索，但训练数据稀缺，现有方法生成的光学流缺乏语义运动理解。

Method: 通过预训练的视频扩散模型，将运动知识迁移到静态图像，生成语义感知的光学流。

Result: 在多个基准测试中性能提升，验证了运动知识迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: TransFlow通过生成逼真的训练数据，解决了视频显著目标检测的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Method: 提出DepthFlow方法，通过从单张图像估计深度图并转换为合成光流，生成大规模训练数据。

Result: 使用合成数据训练的简单编码器-解码器架构在所有公开VOS基准测试中达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: DepthFlow为数据稀缺问题提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的神经网络架构可以提高效率，使模型更小、更快、更经济。

Conclusion: 通过架构优化，可以在减少计算资源的同时提升模型性能，满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Conclusion: ForCenNet通过关注前景元素，显著提升了文档图像校正的效果，为后续研究提供了资源支持。

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

Motivation: 现有解码器查询类型（如内容查询和位置查询）的作用未被充分探索，固定查询限制了灵活性，且存在ROT和查询模糊性问题。

Method: 提出单查询范式，将固定查询转为灵活查询；通过注意力解耦学习简化解码器框架，直接解决ROT和查询模糊性问题；引入PoCoo损失优化小目标检测。

Result: 在COCO2017和WiderPerson数据集上验证了DS-Det的通用性和优越性。

Conclusion: DS-Det通过灵活查询和注意力解耦学习，显著提升检测器效率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

Conclusion: SeeDiff展示了利用生成模型的注意力机制实现高效像素级标注的潜力。

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

TL;DR: FM-LC框架通过分层方法（多类U-Net、二进制专家模型和贝叶斯平滑）改进干旱地区城市洪水映射，显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干旱地区城市洪水对基础设施和社区构成严重风险，但传统洪水映射方法因光谱对比度低、水文动态快和城市覆盖异质性高而受限。

Method: FM-LC采用三阶段方法：多类U-Net分割、二进制专家模型纠正误分类、贝叶斯平滑优化边界。

Result: 在迪拜2024年风暴事件中验证，FM-LC平均F1分数提升29%，洪水边界更清晰。

Conclusion: FM-LC框架显著优于传统单阶段方法，适用于干旱地区高分辨率洪水映射。

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

Result: 实验表明，Lava在查询性能上显著提升（F1分数提高14%，MPAE降低0.39，处理速度快9.6倍）。

Conclusion: Lava为大规模视频数据分析提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

*Samuel Ebimobowei Johnny,Blessed Guda,Andrew Blayama Stephen,Assane Gueye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSign提出了一种基于自回归解码器Transformer的方法，直接通过姿态序列生成自然语言文本，解决了传统多阶段CSLR方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连续手语识别方法存在误差传播、过拟合和词汇扩展瓶颈问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 使用1D CNN压缩姿态序列，结合预训练的AraGPT2解码器直接生成文本，绕过传统对齐机制。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，AutoSign的WER分数比现有最佳方法提高了6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoSign通过简化流程和直接学习文本依赖，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为KR-NFT的新方法，通过负特征调整和知识正则化策略，提升视觉语言模型的OOD检测能力，同时保持对未见类和风格的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决负提示调优在OOD检测中泛化性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出负特征调整（NFT）和知识正则化（KR）优化策略，通过分布感知变换和轻量级元网络动态适应图像。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，KR-NFT显著降低了FPR95，并提升了ID分类和OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: KR-NFT在OOD检测中表现出高效性和可扩展性，同时减少了对预训练知识的遗忘。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

Motivation: 现有方法常忽略具体身体部位动作及其时序，需通过更详细的文本描述改进。

Result: 实验显示数据集显著提升细粒度动作生成任务性能，MDM模型Top-3准确率提高15.3%。

Conclusion: FineMotion数据集有效支持细粒度动作生成与编辑，为相关任务提供重要资源。

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

### [33] [A Structure-aware and Motion-adaptive Framework for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19852)
*Ye Lu,Jie Wang,Jianjun Gao,Rui Gong,Chen Cai,Kim-Hui Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构感知和运动自适应的姿态提升框架SAMA，通过SSI和MSM模块分别处理关节拓扑和运动特征，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂的关节连接和运动特征差异，需要更高效且自适应的解决方案。

Method: SAMA框架包含SSI（基于拓扑融合信息）和MSM（识别并调整运动特征），实现结构感知和运动自适应。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，计算成本更低。

Conclusion: SAMA通过结构感知和运动自适应设计，显著提升了姿态提升任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

TL;DR: RaGS框架利用3D高斯泼溅技术融合4D雷达和单目图像，实现高效3D物体检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有融合方法在场景理解或网格结构上的局限性。

Method: 采用级联流程，包括FLI初始化高斯位置、IMA融合语义和几何信息、MGF渲染多级BEV特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: RaGS通过动态聚焦稀疏物体，提供全面场景感知，性能领先。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

TL;DR: OW-CLIP是一个视觉分析系统，通过多模态提示调优和Crop-Smoothing技术解决开放世界目标检测的数据依赖和过拟合问题，同时利用双模态数据精炼和可视化界面提升标注效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统开放世界目标检测方法依赖大量标注数据且易过拟合，OW-CLIP旨在通过数据高效训练和灵活模型改进这些问题。

Method: 采用多模态提示调优、Crop-Smoothing技术，结合语言模型和跨模态相似性进行数据精炼，并提供可视化标注界面。

Result: OW-CLIP仅需3.8%自生成数据即可达到89%的SOTA性能，数据量相同时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OW-CLIP通过高效数据利用和可视化工具显著提升了开放世界目标检测的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

TL;DR: DiffCode是一个新型框架，通过潜在扩散增强的向量量化码本先验，解决多任务医学图像恢复（MedIR）中的异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理不同MedIR任务中多样化的信息损失，因此需要一种统一模型来恢复多种高质量医学图像。

Method: DiffCode构建任务自适应码本库，结合潜在扩散策略，迭代优化潜在特征分布，以更准确地估计高质量先验特征。

Result: DiffCode在MRI超分辨率、CT去噪和PET合成三个任务中，定量指标和视觉质量均表现优异。

Conclusion: DiffCode通过任务自适应码本库和潜在扩散策略，有效解决了多任务MedIR中的异构性问题，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATCTrack提出了一种新型视觉语言跟踪器，通过动态目标状态对齐的多模态线索和全面的目标-上下文特征建模，实现鲁棒跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言跟踪器在复杂长期场景中难以动态对齐目标状态，且无法有效区分文本提示中的目标与上下文词汇。

Method: 1. 提出时间视觉目标-上下文建模方法；2. 基于文本内容精确识别目标词汇，并设计上下文词汇校准方法；3. 在主流基准上验证性能。

Result: ATCTrack在主流基准上达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ATCTrack通过动态对齐多模态线索和上下文建模，显著提升了视觉语言跟踪的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

TL;DR: T2I-Copilot是一个无需训练的多代理系统，通过多模态大语言模型协作自动优化文本到图像生成的提示词、模型选择和迭代改进，显著提升生成质量和文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型对提示词敏感，用户需反复调整且缺乏明确反馈，现有方法可控性有限或需额外训练。

Method: T2I-Copilot包含三个代理：输入解析器、生成引擎和质量评估器，分别负责解析输入、选择模型并生成、评估质量并提供反馈。

Result: 在开源模型上，T2I-Copilot的VQA分数接近商业模型，成本仅为FLUX1.1-pro的16.59%且性能超越多个模型。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot通过多代理协作显著简化提示工程，提升生成质量，支持全自动或人工干预模式。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and
small student neural network that outperforms the teacher, while being suitable
for real-time onboard deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法在恢复色彩映射方面表现优异，并能推广到带有色彩图例或离散调色板的可视化中。

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

Method: 提出FedS2R框架，包括不一致性驱动的数据增强和多客户端知识蒸馏方案。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上测试，全局模型显著优于单个客户端模型，仅比同时访问所有数据的模型低2 mIoU。

Conclusion: FedS2R在联邦学习下有效提升了自动驾驶中合成到真实语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from

Motivation: 增强视觉语言Transformer中目标定位的准确性，同时避免重新训练模型的开销。

Result: 在15个开源VLM中，11个模型的FitAP指标提升，最高增益达+26.6%。

Conclusion: RCA不仅提升了性能，还增强了多模态Transformer的可解释性，适用于不同融合时机的模型。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

Conclusion: TrackAny3D为统一模型的重要性提供了启示，并推动大规模预训练模型在该领域的应用。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小批量训练的深度子空间聚类方法，通过引入记忆库和对比学习，解决了传统方法依赖全批量处理的问题，并在性能上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度子空间聚类方法依赖全批量处理，限制了计算效率和可扩展性，尤其是在处理高分辨率图像时。

Method: 结合记忆库保存全局特征表示，并采用对比学习替代自编码器进行表示学习，提出了一种无解码器的框架。

Result: 在COIL100和ORL数据集上，性能优于全批量方法和其他先进子空间聚类方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了计算效率，还保持了高性能，为大规模子空间聚类提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

Result: 在Human-centric Forgery Video (HFV)数据集上，HumanSAM在二进制和多类伪造分类中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HumanSAM通过细粒度分类和鲁棒表示学习，提升了伪造视频检测的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Conclusion: MambaVesselNet++结合CNN和Mamba的优势，高效且性能优越，适用于医学图像分割。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Result: LLM_Control在多种预训练T2I模型上表现出色，生成质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLM_Control能够有效处理复杂输入条件，提升可控T2I生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Result: UniCT Depth在单目深度估计任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniCT Depth通过多模态融合和局部全局特征建模，显著提升了深度估计性能。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

Result: 在工业和医学数据集上表现出强大的零样本检测能力，并可扩展至少样本场景。

Conclusion: AF-CLIP在异常检测任务中具有高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio

projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a

grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated

Conclusion: FROSS为实时3D语义场景图生成提供了一种高效解决方案，并公开了实现和数据集。

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有分类模型和OCTA检测方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在CVD风险评估中表现出色，具有临床实用潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

*Ze Rong,ZiYue Zhao,Zhaoxin Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaRMamba通过多尺度频率变换模块和自监督重建辅助编码器，解决了医学图像分割中的高频信息缺失和空间结构退化问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临模糊边界、高频细节丢失和长程结构建模困难等挑战，现有方法如Vision Mamba虽能建模全局依赖，但导致局部高频信息缺失和空间结构退化。

Method: 提出FaRMamba，包含多尺度频率变换模块（MSFM）恢复高频信息，以及自监督重建辅助编码器（SSRAE）重建空间相关性。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升了边界精度、细节保留和全局一致性。

Conclusion: FaRMamba为医学图像分割提供了灵活的频率感知框架，直接解决了核心挑战。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS标记的偏见，生成长度更长、细节更丰富的图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像描述生成方面取得了显著进展，但生成的描述往往缺乏细节，模型倾向于过早预测EOS标记。

Method: 提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS标记的偏见，鼓励生成更长的描述，无需复杂奖励函数或监督数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著增加了描述长度和相关细节，但幻觉率也有所上升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于任何预训练模型，能显著提升图像描述的细节丰富度。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成人像时过于关注姿态准确性，忽视了全局图像质量。

Result: 在HumanArt数据集上取得AP和CAP的最新最优结果。

Conclusion: KB-DMGen有效提升了人像生成的全局质量和姿态准确性。

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，HDST显著提高了去噪性能并保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决HSI及其他高维视觉数据中的复杂噪声耦合问题提供了新思路和通用框架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Motivation: 内上髁撕脱常见于棒球运动员，表现为骨轮廓不连续，学习正常骨结构连续性对检测异常至关重要。

Method: 采用掩码自编码器框架，学习正常骨结构的连续性，并在撕脱部位产生大的重建误差。

Result: 在16名棒球运动员的数据集上，像素级AUC为0.965，图像级AUC为0.967，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效检测内上髁撕脱，数据集已公开。

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有3D语言模型在大规模稀疏点云中表现不佳，特征提取慢且精度有限。

Method: 提出NeuroVoxel-LM框架，结合动态分辨率多尺度体素化（DR-MSV）和轻量级元嵌入机制（TAP-LME）。

Result: DR-MSV提高了点云特征提取效率和精度，TAP-LME在语义表示上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM有效提升了3D场景感知的语言驱动认知能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

Motivation: 在线视频分割方法在时序一致性上存在挑战，如噪声积累、遮挡和场景转换。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Local2Global框架，结合DETR的查询传播，引入局部和全局查询，并通过L2G-aligner实现早期对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如Youtube-VIS-19/-21和OVIS，AP分别为54.3、49.4和37.0。

Conclusion: Local2Global框架简单高效，无需复杂启发式或内存机制，显著提升了在线视频分割的时序一致性。

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

Result: 在Plant Village和PlantDoc数据集上，Mo-DsCC在准确率和F1分数上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC为智能农业提供了实用工具，并为行业和学术界带来新思路。

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge
statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key
fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy,

Conclusion: WMNet有效解决了跨模态错位问题，提升了目标检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

Result: 实验表明，GT-mean loss的引入在不同方法和数据集上均能带来一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: GT-mean loss是一种简单有效的解决方案，解决了亮度不匹配问题，提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\
\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

*Clinton Ansun Mo,Kun Hu,Chengjiang Long,Dong Yuan,Wan-Chi Siu,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出PUMPS，一种针对TPC数据的自编码器架构，用于解决运动数据跨骨架传输的挑战，并在运动合成任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于骨骼比例或结构的差异，运动数据难以跨骨架传输，TPC提供了一种无结构的兼容表示，但缺乏直接用于运动任务学习的能力。

Method: 提出PUMPS架构，通过独立降维和采样特征向量，结合线性分配点配对优化重建，避免昂贵的点注意力机制。

Result: PUMPS在运动预测、过渡生成和关键帧插值等任务中表现优异，无需原生数据集监督即可达到先进水平。

Conclusion: PUMPS是一种通用架构，在运动去噪和估计任务中优于其他方法，展示了TPC数据在运动合成中的潜力。

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

Motivation: 研究VLMs如何识别空间关系和感知空间运动，填补这一领域的探索空白。

Method: 构建合成数据集，将空间理解分为绝对空间理解和3D空间理解两类，并测试多个先进VLMs。

Result: 人类表现接近完美，而VLMs仅在最简单任务上达到人类水平，其他任务表现显著较差，某些任务甚至接近零分。

Conclusion: VLMs在空间理解能力上有显著改进空间，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法忽视光照变化对红外和可见光图像融合质量的影响，导致融合结果存在模态偏差。

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse通过动态多级融合和竞争性损失函数，显著提升了图像融合性能。

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

Result: 在四项低层视觉任务中，SAMwave显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAMwave高效、灵活且可解释，适用于适应分割模型。

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

Conclusion: 该模型通过全局与局部特征融合，有效提升了矿区复杂场景的分类能力。

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke

acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI

TL;DR: L-MCAT是一种基于Transformer的轻量级框架，用于无配对多模态卫星数据的标签高效遥感图像分类，通过两种创新技术显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分类中多模态数据对齐和标签稀缺的问题，提出一种高效且轻量的解决方案。

Method: 引入Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA)压缩高维输入，以及Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA)对比自监督机制，无需像素级对齐或标签。

Result: 在SEN12MS数据集上达到95.4%的准确率，仅需每类20个标签，参数和计算量大幅减少。

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer
(L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote
sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal satellite data. L-MCAT
introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that
compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and
23x fewer FLOPs than MCTrans. It maintains over 92% accuracy even under 50%
spatial misalignment, demonstrating robustness for real-world deployment. The
model trains end-to-end in under 5 hours on a single consumer GPU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为可控特征白化的框架，通过消除目标与偏置特征之间的线性相关性，显著减轻了深度神经网络的偏见问题，无需建模高阶依赖或使用正则化项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能的广泛应用，开发可信赖的AI变得至关重要。然而，深度神经网络容易学习数据集中的虚假相关性，影响了可靠性。

Method: 通过协方差矩阵量化目标与偏置特征的线性相关性，并通过白化模块消除这种相关性。该方法无需正则化或对抗学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（Corrupted CIFAR-10、Biased FFHQ、WaterBirds和Celeb-A）上验证了方法的优越性，显著减轻了偏见。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过调整权重系数，有效平衡了算法的效用与公平性，同时避免了不稳定优化问题。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于测试时训练（TTT）的假新闻视频检测框架T$^3$SVFND，通过自监督辅助任务增强模型对紧急新闻的检测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻视频检测方法因不同事件间分布偏移而泛化能力不足，尤其在紧急新闻场景下性能显著下降。

Method: 设计了基于掩码语言建模（MLM）的自监督辅助任务，结合多模态信息（音频和视频）预测掩码词，并在测试时训练阶段通过辅助任务适应测试数据分布。

Result: 在公开基准测试中表现优异，尤其对紧急新闻检测效果显著。

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND框架有效提升了假新闻视频检测的鲁棒性，尤其在紧急新闻场景下表现突出。

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

*Qiaosi Yi,Shuai Li,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Yuhui Wu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Transfer VAE Training (TVT)策略，通过将8倍降采样的VAE转换为4倍降采样的VAE，同时适配预训练的UNet，以提升图像超分辨率中精细结构的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散(SD)模型的图像超分辨率方法在重建图像精细结构（如小字符和纹理）时表现不佳，主要原因是SD模型中VAE的激进降采样（8倍）。

Method: 提出TVT策略：先基于原始VAE编码器输出特征训练4倍解码器，再固定解码器训练4倍编码器，同时优化VAE和UNet的网络结构以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，TVT方法显著改善了精细结构的保留效果，且计算量低于当前最优的一步扩散模型。

Conclusion: TVT策略有效解决了SD模型中VAE降采样率过高的问题，同时提升了计算效率，为图像超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

*Zeyu Xia,Chenxi Sun,Tianyu Xin,Yubo Zeng,Haoyu Chen,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT框架通过无监督采样和敏感权重更新，快速适应跨传感器图像融合任务，显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在跨传感器数据上性能下降的问题，避免昂贵的全量重训练。

Method: 采用基于数据流形结构的无监督采样策略，选择3%最具信息量的样本，通过梯度分析更新敏感权重。

Result: 将适应时间从小时级缩短至约一分钟，性能超越直接迁移基线，接近或优于全量重训练。

Conclusion: SWIFT为跨传感器图像融合提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，显著提升了模型适应能力。

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中插入3D对象在增强现实、虚拟试穿等应用中具有挑战性，传统方法难以同时满足时间一致性和真实光照需求。

Method: 结合3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）和2D扩散模型，通过分离对象属性（如反照率、阴影）并优化3DGS模型，实现时间一致性和真实光照。

Result: 该方法在动态手腕场景中成功插入手镯，实现了时间一致性和真实光照效果。

Conclusion: 首次结合3D渲染和2D扩散模型，为视频对象插入提供了高效且逼真的解决方案。

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于基线方法，对噪声、大变形和视野受限具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PIVOTS为肝脏配准提供了高效解决方案，并公开了代码和数据集以促进公平比较。

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code

Method: 提出VIM攻击的分类法，构建数据集AR-VIM，开发多模态框架VIM-Sense，结合视觉语言模型和OCR技术。

Result: VIM-Sense在AR-VIM数据集上检测准确率达88.94%，优于单模态基线，检测延迟约7秒。

Conclusion: VIM-Sense能有效检测AR中的视觉信息操纵攻击，为AR安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部美感预测（FBP）由于主观性和复杂特征，现有方法难以学习与高级美学评估对齐的特征表示。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）在FFHQ数据集上自监督预训练Diffusion Transformer；2）冻结编码器，微调轻量回归头。

Result: 在FBP5500基准测试中，PCC达到0.932，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成预训练策略是关键，为视觉主观任务提供了更语义化的特征表示。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

Motivation: 卡通动画生成面临复杂性和数据稀缺的挑战，需要填补真实视频与卡通动画之间的领域差距。

Method: 构建了大规模、多模态的MagicAnime数据集，包含多种任务的数据和基准测试。

Result: 实验验证了数据集在支持高保真、细粒度、可控生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MagicAnime数据集和基准测试为卡通动画生成任务提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强因噪声、细节丢失和对比度差而具有挑战性，现有方法仅依赖RGB图像，忽略了多模态信息。

Method: 提出ModalFormer框架，包含跨模态Transformer（CM-T）和多个辅助子网络，采用CM-MSA机制融合RGB与多模态特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现最优性能。

Conclusion: ModalFormer通过多模态信息融合显著提升了低光图像增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

Conclusion: 论文验证了五种模型在印度驾驶数据集上的性能，为自动驾驶场景理解提供了参考。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

Conclusion: VESPA展示了在可扩展3D场景理解中的强大性能，为自动标注提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: This work summarises and reports the results of the second Presentation
Attack Detection competition on ID cards. This new version includes new
elements compared to the previous one. (1) An automatic evaluation platform was
enabled for automatic benchmarking; (2) Two tracks were proposed in order to
evaluate algorithms and datasets, respectively; and (3) A new ID card dataset
was shared with Track 1 teams to serve as the baseline dataset for the training
and optimisation. The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company
jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"
team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,
improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,
respectively. These results suggest that PAD on ID cards is improving, but it
is still a challenging problem related to the number of images, especially of
bona fide images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究利用卷积神经网络（CNN）开发了一个实时印度手语（ISL）检测与翻译系统，旨在解决印度聋哑人群的沟通障碍。模型在ISL数据集上训练，分类准确率达99.95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聋哑人群依赖手语沟通，但缺乏熟练翻译和技术支持，尤其在印度，ISL的技术解决方案较少。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用CNN模型，结合MediaPipe进行实时手势追踪和动作检测，训练于全面的ISL数据集。

Result: 模型分类准确率达99.95%，并通过F1分数、精确率和召回率等指标验证了其可靠性。

Conclusion: 该系统为印度聋哑人群提供了高效的实时手语翻译解决方案，显著提升了沟通效率。

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Result: 通过基础模型的泛化能力，有效解决了数据不足问题，提升了预测准确性。

Conclusion: 深度学习和基础模型为工作适应性预测提供了新途径，尤其在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

Method: 联合学习3D人脸重建和说话头部合成模型，提出新的唇同步流程，分离下巴轮廓并减少嘴部闪烁。

Result: 生成的面部质量更高，唇同步效果更自然，减少了嘴部闪烁。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化3DMM和唇同步流程，显著提升了说话头部合成的效果。

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

TL;DR: SparseVAR是一个即插即用的加速框架，通过动态排除低频token来优化高分辨率图像生成的计算开销，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉自回归模型在高分辨率阶段因大量token导致计算开销大，而低频token对图像质量影响较小且相似度高。

Method: 利用轻量级MSE指标识别低频token，并通过锚点token保持区域保真度，实现高效加速。

Result: 在Infinity-2B上实现2倍加速且质量损失极小。

Conclusion: SparseVAR显著降低计算成本，同时保持高质量图像生成。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少误诊，并在多类场景中优先处理重要症状。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了MIL的临床局限性，验证了其在实际病例中的有效性。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

Result: 在ScanNet-GSReg和Coord数据集上，配准的RRE降低41.9%，融合的PSNR提升10.11 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了场景对齐和重建的准确性，适用于机器人感知和自主导航。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Conclusion: 探索主导属性有助于提升少样本学习的判别性表示和分类性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

Result: 实验表明，T2VParser能有效实现部分对齐，保留预训练模型知识。

Conclusion: T2VParser通过多视角语义表示和自适应对齐，提升了文本-视频检索的准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease

vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic
grain classification system for green lentils (Lens Culinaris), which leverages
computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决草图质量评估问题，避免依赖人工标注，提升草图识别和应用的效率。

Method: 提出Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL)，将特征幅度与可识别性学习作为双重任务，通过交叉熵分类损失优化。

Result: GACL与人类质量感知一致，并成功应用于草图质量评估、图像质量评估及噪声标签清理。

Conclusion: GACL是一种通用方法，适用于多种视觉表示和问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly

### [118] [FED-PsyAU: Privacy-Preserving Micro-Expression Recognition via Psychological AU Coordination and Dynamic Facial Motion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20557)
*Jingting Li,Yu Qian,Lin Zhao,Su-Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出FED-PsyAU框架，结合心理学先验和统计特征，通过分层学习和联邦学习提升微表情识别性能，同时保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别（MER）面临样本量小、特征细微和数据隐私问题，需在隐私约束下提升跨场景识别能力。

Method: 通过心理学研究协调面部动作单元（AUs），开发DPK-GAT网络结合先验知识与统计模式，采用联邦学习框架避免数据共享。

Result: 在常用ME数据库上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升MER性能。

Conclusion: FED-PsyAU框架成功解决了MER中的隐私和样本限制问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Hyung Kyu Kim,Sangmin Lee,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemoryTalker提出了一种仅需音频输入即可生成逼真3D面部动画的方法，无需额外先验信息，显著提升了实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外先验信息（如说话者类别标签或3D面部网格），无法准确反映说话风格，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1.记忆通用运动；2.通过音频驱动的说话风格特征个性化合成面部运动。

Result: 实验证明，MemoryTalker在定量、定性评估及用户研究中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemoryTalker实现了无需先验的高质量个性化面部动画，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的语音上下文感知损失函数，用于改善语音驱动的3D面部动画的连续性和自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过逐帧对齐真实数据最小化重建损失，但忽略了面部运动的连续性，导致动画抖动和不自然。

Method: 提出了一种基于语音上下文感知的损失函数，通过引入视位协同发音权重，动态调整面部运动的重要性。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于传统重建损失。

Conclusion: 强调显式建模语音上下文依赖的视位对合成自然语音驱动3D面部动画的重要性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

Motivation: 传统单模态船舶检测方法在复杂场景（如多变光照和浓雾）中受限，需探索多模态融合的优势。

Result: 在NSLSR数据集上验证了算法的优越性，检测性能显著提升。

Conclusion: LSFDNet在多模态融合和检测任务中表现优异，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型未充分利用MRI切片间的空间相关性，这种相关性类似于视频分割中的时序数据，M-Net旨在填补这一空白。

Method: M-Net采用Mesh-Cast机制整合时序模型，设计TPS训练策略，先学习序列通用模式，再优化切片特征提取。

Result: 在BraTS2019和BraTS2023数据集上，M-Net在所有关键指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-Net是一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于时序感知的MRI肿瘤分割任务。

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法（如MSE、GAN、扩散模型）难以平衡修复质量、保真度和速度，HYPIR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HYPIR通过预训练扩散模型初始化修复模型，再用对抗训练微调，避免扩散损失和迭代采样。

Result: HYPIR在数值稳定性、避免模式崩溃和加速收敛方面表现优异，且支持文本引导修复和纹理调整。

Conclusion: HYPIR在高效高质量图像修复上优于现有方法，单次前向传播即可完成。

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence基准测试中验证了DAMS的有效性。

Conclusion: DAMS通过双路径互补和信息融合，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

<details>

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）因视觉令牌数量庞大导致计算成本高，现有基于注意力的方法存在局限性（如位置偏差），需探索新的令牌重要性评估方法。

Method: 提出TransPrune方法，结合令牌转移变化（TTV）和指令引导注意力（IGA）评估令牌重要性，逐步修剪令牌。

Result: 实验表明，TransPrune在保持与原始LVLM（如LLaVA-v1.5和LLaVA-Next）相当的多模态性能的同时，将推理计算量（TFLOPs）减少一半以上。

Conclusion: TTV本身可作为有效标准，无需依赖注意力机制，性能与基于注意力的方法相当。代码将公开。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a

straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且鲁棒，无需预训练扩散模型，为跨域图像合成提供了新思路，并发布了基准数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种隐式反事实框架（ICF）和多粒度隐式文本（MIT）来解决音频-视觉分割中的模态表示差异和不平衡问题，通过语义反事实（SC）和协作分布感知对比学习（CDCL）提升性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注交互效率，忽视了模态表示差异和不平衡问题，导致复杂场景下错误匹配和音频特征被边缘化。

Method: 引入ICF和MIT作为模态共享空间的桥梁，提出SC学习正交表示，并通过CDCL进行对比学习以对齐表示。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ICF和MIT有效减少了模态差异，SC和CDCL避免了知识偏好，提升了音频-视觉分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: ReSoRA提出了一种自适应正则化低秩适应（LoRA）子空间冗余的方法，通过显式建模和去冗余约束，提升了参数高效迁移学习（PETL）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA及其变体在训练中投影矩阵不受限制，导致表示冗余和特征适应效果下降，而现有方法缺乏灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: ReSoRA将低秩子矩阵分解为多个等价子空间，并系统地对不同投影的特征分布应用去冗余约束。

Result: 实验表明，ReSoRA在多种骨干网络和数据集上提升了现有PETL方法的性能，且无需额外推理成本。

Conclusion: ReSoRA作为一种训练监督方法，可无缝集成到现有方法中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

Result: 方法对振动源具有不变性，能够泛化到未见过的容器实例和液体水平，并在多种日常容器上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为远程、非接触式检测液体水平提供了一种创新解决方案。

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Method: 提出KASportsFormer框架，包含BoneExt和LimbFus模块，提取并融合运动学特征。

Result: 在SportsPose和WorldPose数据集上分别达到58.0mm和34.3mm的MPJPE误差，表现最优。

Conclusion: KASportsFormer通过运动学特征增强，显著提升了体育场景中的姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Conclusion: ATR-UMMIM将推动无人机多模态配准、融合和感知的研究，数据集已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

Motivation: MLLMs在视觉任务中表现优异，但依赖图像-文本监督限制了其深度推理能力的发展。

Method: 基于“验证不对称性”原则，RRVF通过推理-渲染-视觉反馈的闭环迭代过程，利用强化学习优化模型。

Result: 在图像到代码生成任务中，RRVF显著优于现有开源MLLM和监督微调基线。

Conclusion: 纯视觉反馈驱动的系统为无需显式监督的鲁棒推理模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available

Result: 实验表明，RingMo-Agent在视觉理解和复杂分析任务中表现优异，且具有跨平台和模态的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent为多样化遥感图像处理提供了统一框架，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

Conclusion: 合成数据，尤其是SD35生成的平衡数据集，可用于构建更公平的人脸识别系统，但需注意增强的数量和质量。

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的进步，伪造身份证的威胁增加，现有公开数据集不足以模拟真实场景，因此需要更复杂的数据集来开发检测算法。

Method: 创建FantasyID数据集，包含多样化的身份证设计、语言和真实人脸，模拟真实KYC场景（打印和拍摄），并模拟数字伪造攻击。

Result: 现有先进检测算法（如TruFor、MMFusion等）在FantasyID数据集上表现不佳，假阴性率接近50%。

Conclusion: FantasyID数据集复杂度高，适合作为检测算法的评估基准。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing

significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention
module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and

Conclusion: 揭示了CLIP少样本分类评估的问题，通过遗忘技术提供解决方案，并提出新基准和改进方法。

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

Conclusion: METEOR首次实现了高效的多编码器视觉语言模型，通过多阶段剪枝策略显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code

TL;DR: $S^3$LAM是一种新型RGB-D SLAM系统，通过2D面元（surfel）实现高效几何表示，提升跟踪与建图精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯椭球的SLAM方法效率不足，$S^3$LAM通过2D高斯面元优化场景表示，专注于物体表面，提升几何重建质量。

Method: 采用2D高斯面元作为基元，提出自适应表面渲染策略优化实时建图，并推导相机位姿雅可比矩阵以提升跟踪收敛性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，$S^3$LAM性能达到最优。

Conclusion: $S^3$LAM通过2D面元实现高效几何表示，显著提升SLAM系统的精度和效率。

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对象中心表示的视频合成框架，通过时间一致的动态对象槽和预训练扩散模型实现高质量视频生成与编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏生成能力或忽略对象级结构，无法满足视频合成的需求。

Method: 学习姿态不变的对象槽，结合预训练扩散模型，实现时间一致的对象级视频合成与编辑。

Result: 在视频生成质量和时间一致性上超越现有方法，支持对象插入、删除和替换等编辑功能。

Conclusion: 该方法在视频生成和编辑方面具有显著优势，为高级内容创作和动态场景理解开辟了新可能。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出UnionCut和UnionSeg方法，解决无监督对象发现中的前景判别和对象数量不确定问题，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督对象发现（UOD）缺乏标注数据，现有方法依赖启发式前景先验和固定迭代次数，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出基于min-cut和集成方法的UnionCut前景先验，以及高效准确的UnionSeg蒸馏模型。

Conclusion: UnionCut和UnionSeg为UOD提供了更鲁棒的前景判别和动态停止机制，显著提升现有方法性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病影响全球5500万人，现有诊断方法无法同时满足高准确性、跨数据集泛化、模态缺失鲁棒性和可解释性，限制了临床可靠性。

Method: OmniBrain整合多模态数据（脑MRI、影像组学、基因表达、临床数据），采用统一模型结合跨注意力和模态丢弃技术。

Result: 在ANMerge数据集上达到92.2%准确率，在MRI-only的ADNI数据集上达到70.4%准确率，优于单模态和现有多模态方法。

Conclusion: OmniBrain为阿尔茨海默病诊断提供了鲁棒、可解释且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

Result: 实验显示DriveAgent-R1性能领先，优于Claude Sonnet 4等模型，决策基于主动感知的视觉证据。

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1为更安全、智能的自动驾驶系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非手动面部特征在手语交流中至关重要，但在自动手语识别中尚未充分探索。现有研究多依赖手工特征提取，未能深入比较不同面部区域的贡献。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（CNN和Transformer）在孤立手语数据集上训练，系统评估眼睛、嘴部和全脸等不同面部区域的贡献。

Result: 通过定量和定性分析，发现嘴部是最重要的非手动面部特征，显著提升了识别准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在自动手语识别中纳入面部特征的必要性。

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在Img2LaTeX任务中表现不佳，尤其在细粒度视觉元素处理上存在不足。

Method: 提出$A^2R^2$框架，结合注意力定位和迭代优化，使VLMs能自我修正并逐步提升预测质量。

Result: $A^2R^2$在六项评估指标上显著优于基线方法，且推理轮次增加带来性能提升。

Conclusion: $A^2R^2$通过核心组件的协同作用，有效提升了Img2LaTeX任务的性能，并通过实验验证其实际效果。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

Motivation: 传统图像去雪方法依赖空间信息易产生幻觉伪影，视频方法对帧率要求高且对齐困难。事件相机因其低延迟特性适合解决这一问题。

Method: 设计基于注意力的模块，利用事件数据中雪花的条纹特征恢复被遮挡背景点的原始强度。

Result: 在PSNR上比现有方法高3 dB，且能提升深度估计和光流任务的性能20%。

Conclusion: 该方法为恶劣天气下的视觉系统提供了更可靠的解决方案，推动了全天候应用的发展。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中，不同扫描仪导致的图像差异会影响模型性能，进而影响患者诊断和治疗规划。现有研究未直接评估同一组织在不同扫描仪下的模型一致性。

Method: 引入SCORPION数据集（480个组织样本，每个用5台扫描仪扫描，共2400个对齐图像块），并提出SimCons框架，结合数据增强和一致性损失来提升模型对扫描仪差异的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，SimCons在不影响任务性能的情况下，显著提高了模型在不同扫描仪下的一致性。

Conclusion: SCORPION数据集和SimCons框架为研究社区提供了评估和改进模型一致性的重要资源，为可靠性测试设定了新标准。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Motivation: 人脸操纵技术的快速发展对伪造检测提出了跨域泛化的挑战，传统方法难以学习域不变表示。

Method: HAMLET-FFD结合对比视觉语言模型（如CLIP），通过知识精炼循环和双向融合机制，逐步对齐视觉观察与语义先验。

Result: 实验表明HAMLET-FFD在多个基准测试中对未见过的伪造技术具有优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD作为一种外部插件，保留了CLIP的原始能力，同时显著提升了伪造检测的准确性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空无人机场景中的Referring Image Segmentation（RIS）任务尚未充分研究，现有数据集和方法难以处理其独特特性（如多视角、高密度）。

Method: 提出了RIS-LAD数据集和SAARN模型，后者通过语义感知自适应推理网络（CDLE和ARFM模块）动态处理语义信息。

Result: 实验表明RIS-LAD对现有RIS算法具有挑战性，SAARN模型能有效解决这些挑战。

Conclusion: RIS-LAD填补了低空无人机场景RIS任务的空白，SAARN模型为复杂场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决QBE搜索需要样本查询文档的局限性，通过ABDIR的视觉属性描述结合生成式AI，提供更灵活的检索方式。

Method: 使用Leonardo.Ai作为文本到图像生成器，生成查询图像，再通过CNN提取特征进行QBE检索。

Result: 在HisIR19数据集上验证了T2I-QBE的可行性，表明其适用于历史文档图像检索。

Conclusion: T2I-QBE是首次尝试将文本到图像生成应用于文档图像检索，为DIR领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型缺乏对短视频的深入理解能力，而短视频在移动互联网中占据主导地位，需要复杂的多模态信息整合能力。

Method: 模型通过预训练、指令微调、冷启动、强化学习后训练和最终指令微调的综合训练方案，利用高质量自动标注数据进行训练。

Result: 在ShortVid-Bench基准测试中表现优异，支持零样本或少样本微调，实际部署显著提升了用户参与度和满意度。

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video在短视频理解任务中表现出色，具有高效性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all
publicly available.

Result: 在LRS2和HDTF数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并通过消融实验支持了贡献。

Conclusion: 提出的无掩码方法在保持身份细节和视觉质量方面优于传统掩码策略。

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GTAD的全局时间聚合去噪网络，旨在通过全局时间信息聚合框架提升动态环境感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用全局时间序列信息，主要依赖相邻帧的局部时间交互，限制了动态环境感知的准确性。

Method: 提出GTAD网络，结合局部时间特征和全局时间特征，通过去噪网络实现高效的时间信息聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes和Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: GTAD方法通过全局时间信息聚合，实现了更连贯和全面的环境理解。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用生成式AI合成高质量航拍图像及其标签的方法，通过数据增强提升检测器训练效果，显著提高了跨域检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航拍图像中的车辆检测在交通监控、城市规划等领域有重要应用，但现有模型在不同地理区域的泛化能力不足，主要由于环境条件、城市布局等因素导致的域偏移。

Method: 提出了一种多阶段、多模态知识迁移框架，利用微调的潜在扩散模型（LDMs）来缩小源域和目标域之间的分布差距。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个航拍图像域中显著优于监督学习、弱监督适应、无监督域适应和开放集目标检测器，AP50分别提高了4-23%、6-10%、7-40%和50%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了航拍图像检测中的域偏移问题，并贡献了两个新的标注数据集，推动了该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LargeMvC-Net的新型深度网络架构，通过分解锚点聚类过程为三个模块，提升了大规模多视图聚类的效果和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锚点聚类方法在结构设计上缺乏优化原则，忽视了核心需求。

Method: 将锚点聚类优化问题展开为三个模块：RepresentModule、NoiseModule和AnchorModule，分别对应表示学习、噪声抑制和锚点指示估计。

Result: 在多个大规模多视图基准测试中，LargeMvC-Net在效果和可扩展性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net通过结构清晰和可追踪的优化设计，显著提升了锚点多视图聚类的性能。

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

Conclusion: JWB-DH-V1为未来研究提供了关键方向，数据集和工具已公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“安全张量”的方法，通过可训练的输入向量将文本安全对齐扩展到视觉模态，从而提升大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）对有害图像输入的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本安全机制无法直接应用于视觉模态，导致LVLM容易受到有害图像输入的影响。

Method: 引入安全张量（可训练的输入向量），在推理时通过文本或视觉模态应用，无需修改模型参数。优化使用包含恶意图像-文本对、对比良性对和一般良性样本的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，安全张量显著提升了LVLM拒绝有害视觉输入的能力，同时保持对良性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 安全张量成功激活语言模块的文本“安全层”，将文本安全机制扩展到视觉模态。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

Motivation: 尽管对抗训练有进展，但模型准确性与鲁棒性之间仍存在差距，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 训练多个对抗训练的教师模型，通过多教师知识蒸馏和自适应学习策略指导学生模型学习。

Result: 在MNIST-Digits和Fashion-MNIST数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多教师对抗蒸馏和自适应学习策略能显著增强CNN对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部情感识别系统使用固定标签或抽象维度，无法捕捉情感的丰富性和细微差别，而自然语言提供了更灵活的表达方式。

Method: 引入EmoCap100K数据集（10万样本）和EmoCapCLIP框架，结合全局-局部对比学习和跨模态引导正样本挖掘模块。

Result: 在20多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了从大规模语义丰富描述中学习情感表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 利用自然语言描述学习面部情感表示具有潜力，EmoCapCLIP框架为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at

Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型（如GPT-4o）的封闭性对开源研究的限制。

Method: 利用GPT-4o统一和优化三个流行图像编辑数据集，生成高质量三元组（指令、源图像、编辑图像），并通过改写提示提升语义清晰度。

Result: 微调后的开源模型（如FluxKontext）在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著缩小与专有模型的差距。

Conclusion: GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M的发布有望推动指令引导图像编辑的开源研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

Method: 将现有方法分为五个层次：低层3D属性、3D场景组件、4D动态场景、组件交互建模及物理约束整合。

Result: 提出了一个层次化框架，并总结了每层的挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 通过层次化分析，为4D空间智能的进一步发展提供了指导，并维护了项目页面以跟踪进展。

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Conclusion: 通过优先考虑认知发展而非便利性，'增强认知支架'为真正增强认知能力提供了路径，同时保护自主思考和持续学习。

Abstract: AI systems now function as cognitive extensions, evolving from tools to
active cognitive collaborators within human-AI integrated systems. While these
systems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and
creativity - they present a fundamental "comfort-growth paradox": AI's
user-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive
friction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and
provides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency
rather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to
resolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to
dynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding
principles, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1)
Progressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence
increases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual
needs and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing
mental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity.
Research across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains
supports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved
self-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes
safeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias
amplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in
human-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward
genuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and
continuous learning.

Method: 通过两项研究测试简单监督协议的效果，包括展示正反论点及在线研究对评估者信心的影响。

Result: 协议整体无优势，但展示正反论点可提高模型错误时的准确性；在线研究可能增加对错误答案的信心。

Conclusion: 需测试监督协议对评估者偏见的鲁棒性，以及其是否随问题难度和模型能力提升而扩展。

Abstract: Scalable oversight protocols aim to empower evaluators to accurately verify
AI models more capable than themselves. However, human evaluators are subject
to biases that can lead to systematic errors. We conduct two studies examining
the performance of simple oversight protocols where evaluators know that the
model is "correct most of the time, but not all of the time". We find no
overall advantage for the tested protocols, although in Study 1, showing
arguments in favor of both answers improves accuracy in cases where the model
is incorrect. In Study 2, participants in both groups become more confident in
the system's answers after conducting online research, even when those answers
are incorrect. We also reanalyze data from prior work that was more optimistic
about simple protocols, finding that human evaluators possessing knowledge
absent from models likely contributed to their positive results--an advantage
that diminishes as models continue to scale in capability. These findings
underscore the importance of testing the degree to which oversight protocols
are robust to evaluator biases, whether they outperform simple deference to the
model under evaluation, and whether their performance scales with increasing
problem difficulty and model capability.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: E-polis是一款通过游戏化社会学调查的严肃数字游戏，旨在研究年轻人的政治观点。玩家通过回答社会学问题影响游戏世界，同时游戏采用新颖的中间件架构进行开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过游戏化手段更有效地收集和分析年轻人政治观点数据，避免传统调查的枯燥性。

Method: 设计平台游戏E-polis，玩家通过回答问题影响游戏世界；采用中间件架构开发，专注于数据层分析。

Result: 游戏成功提供了一种创新的社会学研究方法，能够直观展示玩家选择对城市未来的影响。

Conclusion: E-polis为社会学研究提供了新颖的游戏化平台，尤其在年轻人政治观点数据收集方面具有潜力。

Abstract: E-polis is a serious digital game designed to gamify sociological surveys
studying young people's political opinions. In this platform game, players
navigate a digital world, encountering quests posing sociological questions.
Players' answers shape the city-game world, altering building structures based
on their choices. E-polis is a serious game, not a government simulation,
aiming to understand players' behaviors and opinions thus we do not train the
players but rather understand them and help them visualize their choices in
shaping a city's future. Also, it is noticed that no correct or incorrect
answers apply. Moreover, our game utilizes a novel middleware architecture for
development, diverging from typical asset prefab scene and script segregation.
This article presents the data layer of our game's middleware, specifically
focusing on data analysis based on respondents' gameplay answers. E-polis
represents an innovative approach to gamifying sociological research, providing
a unique platform for gathering and analyzing data on political opinions among
youth and contributing to the broader field of serious games.

TL;DR: 论文构建了RISEE数据集，结合无人机和仿真数据，收集人类主观评价和眼动数据，以解决现有数据集缺乏人类因素和安全关键场景的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注车辆运动状态和轨迹，缺乏人类相关信息和安全关键场景，仿真数据集真实性低。

Method: 结合无人机（高真实性和广泛场景覆盖）和仿真（高安全性和可重复性）方法，收集主观评价和眼动数据。

Result: 保留了101名参与者的3567条有效主观风险评分和2045段合格眼动数据。

Conclusion: RISEE数据集填补了人类因素和安全关键场景的空白，为自动驾驶决策系统提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: In the research and development (R&D) and verification and validation (V&V)
phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is
necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation
that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily
focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related
information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient
safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low
authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed
Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically
contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular
naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages
of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and
simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we
first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging
area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are
reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV)
videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited
participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data
is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk
ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with
2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments. The collected data and examples of
the generated FPV videos are available in our website.

Motivation: 探究可穿戴设备提供的睡眠数据是否能增强对睡眠的理解，还是仅量化已知模式。

Method: 29名参与者使用Oura环记录4-8周数据，每日自评睡眠质量并完成工作记忆任务。

Result: REM睡眠、夜间心率、N-Back得分和就寝时间显著预测睡眠自评；不同用户对睡眠标记的敏感度存在差异。

Conclusion: 睡眠追踪器对某些用户的信息增益更大，数据公开可供进一步研究。

Abstract: Wearable devices offer detailed sleep-tracking data. However, whether this
information enhances our understanding of sleep or simply quantifies
already-known patterns remains unclear. This work explores the relationship
between subjective sleep self-assessments and sensor data from an Oura ring
over 4--8 weeks in-the-wild. 29 participants rated their sleep quality daily
compared to the previous night and completed a working memory task. Our
findings reveal that differences in REM sleep, nocturnal heart rate, N-Back
scores, and bedtimes highly predict sleep self-assessment in significance and
effect size. For N-Back performance, REM sleep duration, prior night's REM
sleep, and sleep self-assessment are the strongest predictors. We demonstrate
that self-report sensitivity towards sleep markers differs among participants.
We identify three groups, highlighting that sleep trackers provide more
information gain for some users than others. Additionally, we make all
experiment data publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ChartGen，一个自动化生成图表代码对的管道，用于填补现有基准测试中图表到代码重建任务的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注图表问答或总结，缺乏对图表到代码重建任务的关注。

Method: ChartGen通过视觉语言模型（VLM）和代码导向的大语言模型（LLM）迭代生成图表代码对。

Result: 生成了22.5万对图表代码数据，并评估了6个VLMs，显示仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ChartGen为图表理解和代码生成提供了新资源，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Chart-to-code reconstruction -- the task of recovering executable plotting
scripts from chart images -- provides important insights into a model's ability
to ground data visualizations in precise, machine-readable form. Yet many
existing multimodal benchmarks largely focus primarily on answering questions
about charts or summarizing them. To bridge this gap, we present ChartGen, a
fully-automated pipeline for code-guided synthetic chart generation. Starting
from seed chart images, ChartGen (i) prompts a vision-language model (VLM) to
reconstruct each image into a python script, and (ii) iteratively augments that
script with a code-oriented large language model (LLM). Using ChartGen, we
create 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and
present an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11
plotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV,
DocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation
subset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B -
26B parameters), highlighting substantial room for progress. We release the
pipeline, prompts, and the dataset to help accelerate efforts towards robust
chart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation:

TL;DR: Janus-Pro-CXR（1B）是一种基于DeepSeek Janus-Pro模型的胸部X光解读系统，通过多中心前瞻性试验验证，在报告生成和临床关键发现检测上优于现有模型，显著提升报告质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球放射科医生短缺，胸部X光工作量巨大，现有评估缺乏前瞻性临床验证，需要高效可靠的AI辅助解决方案。

Method: 开发并验证Janus-Pro-CXR系统，通过多中心前瞻性试验（NCT06874647）评估其性能，并与ChatGPT 4o等模型对比。

Result: 系统在报告生成和临床关键发现检测上表现优异（AUC > 0.8），显著提升报告质量（4.37 vs. 4.11）并减少解读时间18.5%。

Conclusion: Janus-Pro-CXR通过轻量级架构和领域优化，提升诊断可靠性和工作流程效率，适用于资源有限环境，并将开源以促进临床转化。

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant
volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although
multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations
predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking
rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray
interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and
rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT06874647). Our
system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated
report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o
(200B parameters), while demonstrating robust detection of eight clinically
critical radiographic findings (area under the curve, AUC > 0.8). Retrospective
evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and
ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly
improved report quality scores (4.37 vs. 4.11, P < 0.001), reduced
interpretation time by 18.5% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of
experts (3 out of 5) in 52.7% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and
domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and
workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model
architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate
the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究通过非接触式摄像头系统监测两位65岁以上老年人的日常活动干预效果，发现干预显著改善了行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏客观指标和个性化策略来衡量日常活动干预对老年人身心健康的影响。

Method: 两位老年人选择喜欢的干预活动（正念用餐和手工艺术），通过摄像头系统监测8周，提取姿势和移动数据进行比较。

Result: 干预期间两位参与者行为显著变化，显示活动和监测系统的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了所选活动和监测系统对老年人行为改善的有效性。

Abstract: Beneficial daily activity interventions have been shown to improve both the
physical and mental health of older adults. However, there is a lack of robust
objective metrics and personalized strategies to measure their impact. In this
study, two older adults aged over 65, living in Edinburgh, UK, selected their
preferred daily interventions (mindful meals and art crafts), which are then
assessed for effectiveness. The total monitoring period across both
participants was 8 weeks. Their physical behaviours were continuously monitored
using a non-contact, privacy-preserving camera-based system. Postural and
mobility statistics were extracted using computer vision algorithms and
compared across periods with and without the interventions. The results
demonstrate significant behavioural changes for both participants, highlighting
the effectiveness of both these activities and the monitoring system.

Result: 通过计算评估和案例研究（如超级计算机日志数据分析）验证了TULCA的有效性。

Conclusion: TULCA为张量比较分析提供了灵活且有效的解决方案，并通过可视化支持分析解释。

Abstract: Comparing tensors and identifying their (dis)similar structures is
fundamental in understanding the underlying phenomena for complex data. Tensor
decomposition methods help analysts extract tensors' essential characteristics
and aid in visual analytics for tensors. In contrast to dimensionality
reduction (DR) methods designed only for analyzing a matrix (i.e., second-order
tensor), existing tensor decomposition methods do not support flexible
comparative analysis. To address this analysis limitation, we introduce a new
tensor decomposition method, named tensor unified linear comparative analysis
(TULCA), by extending its DR counterpart, ULCA, for tensor analysis. TULCA
integrates discriminant analysis and contrastive learning schemes for tensor
decomposition, enabling flexible comparison of tensors. We also introduce an
effective method to visualize a core tensor extracted from TULCA into a set of
2D visualizations. We integrate TULCA's functionalities into a visual analytics
interface to support analysts in interpreting and refining the TULCA results.
We demonstrate the efficacy of TULCA and the visual analytics interface with
computational evaluations and two case studies, including an analysis of log
data collected from a supercomputer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成代理在情感建模上过于简化，限制了模拟的真实性，因此需要更准确的模型。

Method: PSYA框架包含情感模块（分层模型）、思维模块（三网络模型）和行动模块（整合情感、需求和计划），并通过心理实验模拟评估。

Result: PSYA框架生成的行为更自然、一致、多样且可信，成功复现了人类实验结果。

Conclusion: PSYA为生成代理提供了更丰富准确的情感和认知建模方法，可作为心理实验的替代方案。

Abstract: Generative agents have made significant progress in simulating human
behavior, but existing frameworks often simplify emotional modeling and focus
primarily on specific tasks, limiting the authenticity of the simulation. Our
work proposes the Psychological-mechanism Agent (PSYA) framework, based on the
Cognitive Triangle (Feeling-Thought-Action), designed to more accurately
simulate human behavior. The PSYA consists of three core modules: the Feeling
module (using a layer model of affect to simulate changes in short-term,
medium-term, and long-term emotions), the Thought module (based on the Triple
Network Model to support goal-directed and spontaneous thinking), and the
Action module (optimizing agent behavior through the integration of emotions,
needs and plans). To evaluate the framework's effectiveness, we conducted daily
life simulations and extended the evaluation metrics to self-influence,
one-influence, and group-influence, selection five classic psychological
experiments for simulation. The results show that the PSYA framework generates
more natural, consistent, diverse, and credible behaviors, successfully
replicating human experimental outcomes. Our work provides a richer and more
accurate emotional and cognitive modeling approach for generative agents and
offers an alternative to human participants in psychological experiments.

Motivation: 远程听证为当事人提供了便利，但需确保其可信度与可靠性，以不替代现场听证为前提。

Method: 基于法官日常听证实践经验，识别当前平台在验证证词真实性上的不足，提出如眼动追踪、环境验证等定制功能。

Result: 研究表明，开发专注于安全和监控的证人模块可显著提升远程听证的可信度。

Conclusion: 通过技术改进，远程听证可在不损害程序可靠性的前提下，扩大司法可及性。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the technological requirements necessary to enhance the
credibility and reliability of judicial hearings conducted via videoconference,
from the internal perspective of the judiciary. Drawing on the practical
experience of a judge who conducts daily hearings, this study identifies
limitations in current platforms for verifying the authenticity of testimonies
and proposes tailored functionalities for the judicial context. Recognizing
that remote hearings represent a convenience for the parties without replacing
the option of in-person attendance, the article suggests implementing features
such as eye tracking, environment verification, and blocking of parallel
applications, in addition to improvements in transmission quality. The study
concludes that developing specific modules for witnesses - focusing on security
and monitoring - can significantly contribute to equalizing the credibility
between remote and in-person hearings, thus expanding access to justice without
compromising procedural reliability.

Motivation: 探讨AI艺术生成如何更好地体现人类艺术创作中的创造性斗争和风格演变，而非仅关注视觉输出。

Method: 通过历史案例研究，分析艺术风格的形成过程，并提出HCI应开发记录艺术风格起源和演变的技术。

Result: 指出当前AI系统将人类艺术选择简化为可复制的模式，缺乏对创作背景的保留。

Conclusion: 建议HCI研究转向自动记录艺术风格的谱系和创作选择，而非仅追求美学效果的复制。

Abstract: As AI art generation becomes increasingly sophisticated, HCI research has
focused primarily on questions of detection, authenticity, and automation. This
paper argues that such approaches fundamentally misunderstand how artistic
value emerges from the concerns that drive human image production. Through
examination of historical precedents, we demonstrate that artistic style is not
only visual appearance but the resolution of creative struggle, as artists
wrestle with influence and technical constraints to develop unique ways of
seeing. Current AI systems flatten these human choices into reproducible
patterns without preserving their provenance. We propose that HCI's role lies
not only in perfecting visual output, but in developing means to document the
origins and evolution of artistic style as it appears within generated visual
traces. This reframing suggests new technical directions for HCI research in
generative AI, focused on automatic documentation of stylistic lineage and
creative choice rather than simple reproduction of aesthetic effects.

integration particularly for domain-specific needs like myopia, and their
real-world effectiveness as patient education tools has yet to be demonstrated.
Here, we introduce ChatMyopia, an LLM-based AI agent designed to address text

integrates an image classification tool and a retrieval-augmented knowledge
base built from literature, expert consensus, and clinical guidelines. Myopic
maculopathy grading task, single question examination and human evaluations
validated its ability to deliver personalized, accurate, and safe responses to

Result: 提出了GPI-Diff方程，支持包容性人机交互设计，并基于神经可塑性原理论证其可行性。

Conclusion: 研究为人工智能在促进社会心理空间和包容性设计方面提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence provides an opportunity to
create psychological spaciousness in society. Spaciousness is defined as the
ability to hold diverse interpersonal interactions and forms the basis for
vulnerability that leads to authenticity that leads to prosocial behaviors and
thus to societal harmony. This paper demonstrates an attempt to quantify, the
human conditioning to subconsciously modify authentic self-expression to fit
the norms of the dominant culture. Gaze is explored across various marginalized
and intersectional groups, using concepts from postmodern philosophy and
psychology. The effects of gaze are studied through analyzing a few redacted
Reddit posts, only to be discussed in discourse and not endorsement. A
mathematical formulation for the Gaze Pressure Index (GPI)-Diff Composite
Metric is presented to model the analysis of two sets of conversational spaces
in relation to one another. The outcome includes an equation to train Large
Language Models (LLMs) - the working mechanism of AI products such as Chat-GPT;
and an argument for affirming and inclusive HCI, based on the equation, is
presented. The argument is supported by a few principles of Neuro-plasticity,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互式可视化工具在处理百万级以上记录的大数据集时，常因延迟问题无法支持实时交互。

Method: 提出Mosaic Selections模型，通过分析查询和选择谓词，实现自动优化（如预聚合数据），并将其集成到开源Mosaic架构中。

Result: 基准测试显示，优化后的查询延迟显著降低，性能优于未优化查询及Vega语言的现有优化器。

Conclusion: Mosaic Selections模型为多可视化场景提供了灵活、互操作的过滤基础设施，并能扩展到数十亿记录。

Abstract: Though powerful tools for analysis and communication, interactive
visualizations often fail to support real-time interaction with large datasets
with millions or more records. To highlight and filter data, users indicate
values or intervals of interest. Such selections may span multiple components,
combine in complex ways, and require optimizations to ensure low-latency
updates. We describe Mosaic Selections, a model for representing, managing, and
optimizing user selections, in which one or more filter predicates are added to
queries that request data for visualizations and input widgets. By analyzing
both queries and selection predicates, Mosaic Selections enable automatic
optimizations, including pre-aggregating data to rapidly compute selection
updates. We contribute a formal description of our selection model and
optimization methods, and their implementation in the open-source Mosaic
architecture. Benchmark results demonstrate orders-of-magnitude latency
improvements for selection-based optimizations over unoptimized queries and
existing optimizers for the Vega language. The Mosaic Selection model provides
infrastructure for flexible, interoperable filtering across multiple
visualizations, alongside automatic optimizations to scale to millions and even
billions of records.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以可靠解码全字母表，尤其是对运动障碍者。LowKeyEMG通过简化输入集提高可靠性。

Method: 将英语字母表简化为4个手势键，外加3个功能键，结合RWKV语言模型实现高效计算。

Result: 实验显示，参与者单手输入速度达23.3词/分钟，手势效率提升17%，单词准确率98.2%。

Conclusion: LowKeyEMG在输入带宽受限的场景中具有实用价值，尤其适用于辅助技术。

Abstract: We introduce LowKeyEMG, a real-time human-computer interface that enables
efficient text entry using only 7 gesture classes decoded from surface
electromyography (sEMG). Prior work has attempted full-alphabet decoding from
sEMG, but decoding large character sets remains unreliable, especially for
individuals with motor impairments. Instead, LowKeyEMG reduces the English
alphabet to 4 gesture keys, with 3 more for space and system interaction, to
reliably translate simple one-handed gestures into text, leveraging the
recurrent transformer-based language model RWKV for efficient computation. In
real-time experiments, participants achieved average one-handed keyboardless
typing speeds of 23.3 words per minute with LowKeyEMG, and improved gesture
efficiency by 17% (relative to typed phrase length). When typing with only 7
keys, LowKeyEMG can achieve 98.2% top-3 word accuracy, demonstrating that this
low-key typing paradigm can maintain practical communication rates. Our results
have implications for assistive technologies and any interface where input
bandwidth is constrained.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非专家用户因缺乏专业技能，难以创建符合意图的粒子效果，尤其是运动学行为匹配的问题。

Method: 提出一个捕捉语义特征和运动学行为的概念模型，并利用大型语言模型（LLMs）支持意图表达和偏好引导探索。

Result: KinemaFX通过结构化表示和测量粒子效果，支持高效交互搜索，用户研究表明其能有效帮助用户创建定制化效果。

Conclusion: KinemaFX为非专家用户提供了一种高效且定制化的粒子效果创作工具。

Abstract: Particle effects are widely used in games and animation to simulate natural
phenomena or stylized visual effects. However, creating effect artworks is
challenging for non-expert users due to their lack of specialized skills,
particularly in finding particle effects with kinematic behaviors that match
their intent. To address these issues, we present KinemaFX, a kinematic-driven
interactive system, to assist non-expert users in constructing customized
particle effect artworks. We propose a conceptual model of particle effects
that captures both semantic features and kinematic behaviors. Based on the
model, KinemaFX adopts a workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that
supports intent expression through combined semantic and kinematic inputs,
while enabling implicit preference-guided exploration and subsequent creation
of customized particle effect artworks based on exploration results.
Additionally, we developed a kinematic-driven method to facilitate efficient
interactive particle effect search within KinemaFX via structured
representation and measurement of particle effects. To evaluate KinemaFX, we
illustrate usage scenarios and conduct a user study employing an ablation
approach. Evaluation results demonstrate that KinemaFX effectively supports
users in efficiently and customarily creating particle effect artworks.

*Parsa Vares,Éloi Durant,Jun Pang,Nicolas Médoc,Mohammad Ghoniem*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: TS-Insight是一个可视化分析工具，旨在揭示Thompson Sampling算法的内部决策机制，帮助开发者调试和增强信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling及其变体在主动学习中用于平衡探索与利用，但其概率性质使其成为“黑盒”，难以调试和信任。

Method: TS-Insight通过多图展示每个臂的后验分布演变、证据计数和采样结果，支持探索/利用动态的验证、诊断和解释。

Result: 该工具提升了Thompson Sampling算法的可解释性，适用于敏感领域中需要透明决策的场景。

Conclusion: TS-Insight增强了Thompson Sampling算法的可调试性和信任度，适用于复杂决策场景。

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) and its variants are powerful Multi-Armed Bandit
algorithms used to balance exploration and exploitation strategies in active
learning. Yet, their probabilistic nature often turns them into a ``black
box'', hindering debugging and trust. We introduce TS-Insight, a visual
analytics tool explicitly designed to shed light on the internal decision
mechanisms of Thompson Sampling-based algorithms, for model developers. It
comprises multiple plots, tracing for each arm the evolving posteriors,
evidence counts, and sampling outcomes, enabling the verification, diagnosis,
and explainability of exploration/exploitation dynamics. This tool aims at
fostering trust and facilitating effective debugging and deployment in complex
binary decision-making scenarios especially in sensitive domains requiring
interpretable decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合电影化镜头与嵌入式可视化的VR网球转播系统，提升观众沉浸感和叙事清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VR转播系统缺乏有效的镜头语言和动态可视化，限制了观众参与度和叙事清晰度。

Method: 分析400个网球转播片段和25个电影化VR动画，开发设计框架并构建模拟比赛环境。

Result: 开发的VR系统通过动态叠加战术信息和关键事件，显著提升了观众理解和沉浸感。

Conclusion: 系统在用户研究中表现优于传统VR转播方法，提供了更沉浸和信息的观看体验。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) broadcasting has emerged as a promising medium for
providing immersive viewing experiences of major sports events such as tennis.
However, current VR broadcast systems often lack an effective camera language
and do not adequately incorporate dynamic, in-game visualizations, limiting
viewer engagement and narrative clarity. To address these limitations, we
analyze 400 out-of-play segments from eight major tennis broadcasts to develop
a tennis-specific design framework that effectively combines cinematic camera
movements with embedded visualizations. We further refine our framework by
examining 25 cinematic VR animations, comparing their camera techniques with
traditional tennis broadcasts to identify key differences and inform
adaptations for VR. Based on data extracted from the broadcast videos, we
reconstruct a simulated game that captures the players' and ball's motion and
trajectories. Leveraging this design framework and processing pipeline, we
develope Beyond the Broadcast, a VR tennis viewing system that integrates
embedded visualizations with adaptive camera motions to construct a
comprehensive and engaging narrative. Our system dynamically overlays tactical
information and key match events onto the simulated environment, enhancing
viewer comprehension and narrative engagement while ensuring perceptual
immersion and viewing comfort. A user study involving tennis viewers
demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional VR broadcasting methods
in delivering an immersive, informative viewing experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在伦理教育中，课堂讨论后的总结需要准确反映常见主题和少数观点，但实时制作幻灯片对教师来说认知负担过重。

Method: Dynamite通过语义数据绑定和语义建议，将幻灯片内容与讨论数据动态关联，并提供符合教学目标的修订选项。

Result: 在12名参与者的实验中，Dynamite在内容准确性和质量上优于基于文本的AI基线。

Conclusion: Dynamite通过语音和草图输入快速组织内容，结合语义建议加速优化，有效支持实时课堂总结。

Abstract: Facilitating class-wide debriefings after small-group discussions is a common
strategy in ethics education. Instructor interviews revealed that effective
debriefings should highlight frequently discussed themes and surface
underrepresented viewpoints, making accurate representations of insight
occurrence essential. Yet authoring presentations in real time is cognitively
overwhelming due to the volume of data and tight time constraints. We present
Dynamite, an AI-assisted system that enables semantic updates to
instructor-authored slides during live classroom discussions. These updates are
powered by semantic data binding, which links slide content to evolving
discussion data, and semantic suggestions, which offer revision options aligned
with pedagogical goals. In a within-subject in-lab study with 12 participants,
Dynamite outperformed a text-based AI baseline in content accuracy and quality.
Participants used voice and sketch input to quickly organize semantic blocks,
then applied suggestions to accelerate refinement as data stabilized.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究评估了基于任务的工效学评估在非例行工作中的构念效度，发现其收敛效度和判别效度不足，并指出实际工效风险可能被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业5.0推动人本化，直接测量工具在制造业中应用增加，但非例行制造过程中技术限制导致基于任务的评估方法存在效度问题。

Method: 采用多特质多方法（MTMM）矩阵和视频内容分析，通过惯性动作捕捉和Borg的RPE评分量表收集46名参与者的工效暴露数据。

Result: 收敛效度未证实（相关系数0.149-0.243），判别效度证据弱（p<0.001），视频分析揭示三个主要因素影响效度。

Conclusion: 基于任务的评估可能低估实际工效风险，需改进工效评估技术以支持多样化工业过程的累积负荷分析。

Abstract: Direct measurement ergonomic assessment is reshaping occupational safety by
facilitating highly reliable risk estimation. Industry 5.0, advocating
human-centricity, has catalysed increasing adoption of direct measurement tools
in manufacturing industries. However, due to technical and feasibility
constraints in their practical implementations, especially within non routine
manufacturing processes, task based approach to ergonomic assessment is
utilized. Despite enabling operationalization of robust ergonomic assessment
technologies within complicated industrial processes, task based approach
raises several validity concerns. Hence, to ascertain functional utility of the
resultant safety interventions, this study evaluates the construct validity of
task based ergonomic assessment within non routine work utilizing Multitrait
multimethod (MTMM) matrix followed by video-based content analysis. Ergonomic
exposure traits were collected for 46 participants through direct measurement
and self reported techniques utilizing inertial motion capture and Borg's RPE
rating scale respectively. Findings include unsubstantiated convergent validity
(low same trait correlations from 0.149 to 0.243) and weak evidence of
discriminant validity with statistical significance (p value less than 0.001).
The study also identifies three primary factors undermining construct validity
through video based content analysis. Findings also elucidate misinterpretation
of ergonomic risk and action levels. Therefore, practical implications entail
underestimation of actual ergonomic risks when estimated through task based
assessment. This highlights the need for enhancement in ergonomic assessment
technologies focused on cumulative load analysis compatible within diverse
industrial processes.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的兴起，游戏交互从固定命令转向自然对话，但其对玩家表现和体验的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 在《我的世界》中设计LLM辅助界面，通过自然语言与玩家互动，并进行混合方法研究，比较LLM辅助与传统命令界面的效果。

Result: LLM辅助界面显著提升了玩家表现、参与度和整体游戏体验，任务复杂度对两种界面的效果均有显著影响。

Conclusion: LLM辅助界面有潜力革新虚拟体验，但需在直观性、可预测性、透明性和用户自主性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) on the rise, in-game interactions are
shifting from rigid commands to natural conversations. However, the impacts of
LLMs on player performance and game experience remain underexplored. This work
explores LLM's role as a co-builder during gameplay, examining its impact on
task performance, usability, and player experience. Using Minecraft as a
sandbox, we present an LLM-assisted interface that engages players through
natural language, aiming to facilitate creativity and simplify complex gaming
commands. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, comparing
LLM-assisted and command-based interfaces across simple and complex game tasks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that the LLM-assisted interface
significantly improves player performance, engagement, and overall game
experience. Additionally, task complexity has a notable effect on player
performance and experience across both interfaces. Our findings highlight the
potential of LLM-assisted interfaces to revolutionize virtual experiences,
emphasizing the importance of balancing intuitiveness with predictability,
transparency, and user agency in AI-driven, multimodal gaming environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 握力是老年人健康的重要指标，但现有可穿戴握力测量方法笨重且依赖用户，无法满足实际连续测量的需求。

Method: EchoForce通过捕捉前臂屈肌微小皮肤变形反射的声学信号，实现握力测量。

Result: 在11名参与者的研究中，EchoForce用户依赖平均误差率为9.08%，用户独立平均误差率为12.3%，且在不同会话、手部方向和用户间保持准确。

Conclusion: EchoForce为健康监测和新型交互技术提供了实用工具，克服了传统力传感系统的局限性。

Abstract: Grip force is commonly used as an overall health indicator in older adults
and is valuable for tracking progress in physical training and rehabilitation.
Existing methods for wearable grip force measurement are cumbersome and
user-dependent, making them insufficient for practical, continuous grip force
measurement. We introduce EchoForce, a novel wristband using acoustic sensing
for low-cost, non-contact measurement of grip force. EchoForce captures
acoustic signals reflected from subtle skin deformations by flexor muscles on
the forearm. In a user study with 11 participants, EchoForce achieved a
fine-tuned user-dependent mean error rate of 9.08% and a user-independent mean
error rate of 12.3% using a foundation model. Our system remained accurate
between sessions, hand orientations, and users, overcoming a significant
limitation of past force sensing systems. EchoForce makes continuous grip force
measurement practical, providing an effective tool for health monitoring and
novel interaction techniques.

Method: 通过六名教师的形成性研究，开发了CoGrader，结合人类-LLM协作的指标设计、基准测试和AI辅助反馈。

Result: CoGrader提高了评分效率和一致性，并为学生提供了可靠的同伴比较反馈。

Conclusion: 论文探讨了人机协作评分系统的设计见解和伦理考量，展示了CoGrader的潜力。

Abstract: Grading project reports are increasingly significant in today's educational
landscape, where they serve as key assessments of students' comprehensive
problem-solving abilities. However, it remains challenging due to the
multifaceted evaluation criteria involved, such as creativity and
peer-comparative achievement. Meanwhile, instructors often struggle to maintain
fairness throughout the time-consuming grading process. Recent advances in AI,
particularly large language models, have demonstrated potential for automating
simpler grading tasks, such as assessing quizzes or basic writing quality.
However, these tools often fall short when it comes to complex metrics, like
design innovation and the practical application of knowledge, that require an
instructor's educational insights into the class situation. To address this
challenge, we conducted a formative study with six instructors and developed
CoGrader, which introduces a novel grading workflow combining human-LLM
collaborative metrics design, benchmarking, and AI-assisted feedback. CoGrader
was found effective in improving grading efficiency and consistency while
providing reliable peer-comparative feedback to students. We also discuss
design insights and ethical considerations for the development of human-AI
collaborative grading systems.

Motivation: 耳戴设备研究领域因多样性导致文献碎片化，难以追踪进展和识别相关研究，因此需要一种工具来整合和梳理这些研究。

Method: 通过问题导向的过程设计EarXplore平台，应用34个标准标注118项研究，提供表格视图、图形视图、相似性视图和时间线视图四种交互方式。

Result: EarXplore支持定制化探索、目标过滤和交互式信息检索，帮助研究人员高效查询和综合文献，并识别研究空白和机会。

Conclusion: EarXplore是一个动态资源，通过社区更新机制持续演进，旨在推动耳戴设备交互研究的未来发展。

Abstract: Interaction with earables - earphones equipped with additional sensors - has
been identified as one of four major areas of earable research. Worn naturally
and positioned near key physiological signals, earables support a wide range of
interaction modalities and have demonstrated the ability to detect multiple
inputs simultaneously. Yet this diversity has resulted in a fragmented body of
research, making it increasingly difficult to track developments and identify
relevant studies. To address this, we introduce EarXplore, a curated,
interactive online database on earable interaction research. Designed through a
question-centered process that guided both the development of 34 criteria
applied to annotate 118 studies and the structure of the platform, EarXplore
comprises four distinct yet integrated views: a Tabular View for structured
exploration, a Graphical View for visual overviews, a Similarity View for
identifying conceptual links, and a Timeline View for analyzing trends and
scholarly lineage. We demonstrate how the platform supports tailored
exploration, targeted filtering, and interactive information retrieval,
allowing researchers to query the literature and synthesize information in the
format of their choice. We furthermore leverage the contents and capabilities
of the platform to discuss the research gaps and opportunities in the field.
With built-in mechanisms for continuous community updates, EarXplore not only
reflects the current state of the field but also evolves alongside it, serving
as a living resource to inform and accelerate future developments.

Conclusion: 研究为未来利用MLLMs优化学习体验提供了启示。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are beginning to empower new user
experiences that can flexibly generate content from a range of inputs,
including images, text, speech, and video. These capabilities have the
potential to enrich learning by enabling users to capture and interact with
information using a variety of modalities, but little is known about how
educators envision how MLLMs might shape the future of learning experiences,
what challenges diverse teachers encounter when interpreting how these models
work, and what practical needs should be considered for successful
implementation in educational contexts. We investigated educator perspectives
through formative workshops with 12 K-12 educators, where participants
brainstormed learning opportunities, discussed practical concerns for effective
use, and prototyped their own MLLM-powered learning applications using Claude
3.5 and its Artifacts feature for previewing code-based output. We use case
studies to illustrate two contrasting end-user approaches (teacher-and
student-driven), and share insights about opportunities and concerns expressed
by our participants, ending with implications for leveraging MLLMs for future
learning experiences.

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升XR文本输入效率，适合日常任务。

Abstract: Text input in extended reality (XR) applications remains inefficient and
tedious. Most solutions are derived from the traditional keyboard layout, yet
fail to translate its positive characteristics to the spatial digital realm.
This limits the productive use of immersive technologies. In this work, we
analyze physical keyboard input to identify key characteristics that facilitate
its comfort, touch typing and high typing speeds. Building on these findings,
we propose a novel pressure-based text input modality that transfers these
characteristics into immersive space by substituting the two-dimensional QWERTY
layout with a linear scale. This design facilitates a touch-typing-like
experience, eliminating the need for visual guidance for proficient users. Our
skill-based approach enables typing speeds of over 200 characters per minute.
Additionally, it is suitable for discreet use in public spaces and everyday
text-input tasks, since the proposed system requires virtually no hand or
finger movements and resembles smartphone-based text input in appearance.

Result: 视觉吸引力偏见影响投影选择，且在彩色标签和短曝光时间下更明显。

Conclusion: 提出策略以减轻降维投影感知和解释中的偏见。

Abstract: Selecting the dimensionality reduction technique that faithfully represents
the structure is essential for reliable visual communication and analytics. In
reality, however, practitioners favor projections for other attractions, such
as aesthetics and visual saliency, over the projection's structural
faithfulness, a bias we define as visual interestingness. In this research, we
conduct a user study that (1) verifies the existence of such bias and (2)
explains why the bias exists. Our study suggests that visual interestingness
biases practitioners' preferences when selecting projections for analysis, and
this bias intensifies with color-encoded labels and shorter exposure time.
Based on our findings, we discuss strategies to mitigate bias in perceiving and
interpreting DR projections.

Abstract: Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing global challenge, with millions of
functional components discarded due to the difficulty of repair and reuse.
Traditional circuit assembly relies on soldering, which creates semi-permanent
bonds that limit component recovery and contribute to unnecessary waste. We
introduce ProForm, a thermoforming approach for solder-free circuit
prototyping. By encapsulating electronic components with pressure-formed
thermoplastics, ProForm enables secure, reversible mounting without the need
for solder or custom mechanical housings. This approach supports a wide range
of substrates, including flexible, paper-based, and non-planar circuits,
facilitating easy reuse, replacement, and rapid prototyping. We demonstrate
ProForm's versatility to support prototyping practices. We show that ProFormed
circuits exhibit good electrical performance and mechanical stability. While
motivated by a need for sustainable electronics practices, ProForm has other
significant advantages over traditional soldering.

Motivation: 自适应训练系统旨在通过动态调整难度提高学习效率和记忆保持，但设计选择可能影响学习者的认知负荷。

Method: 参与者通过VR逐步学习形状组装，认知负荷通过内在负荷（形状复杂度）、外在负荷（指令冗长）和关联负荷（自适应与固定训练）三个维度进行操控。

Result: 高内在负荷显著增加训练时间和主观负荷，但不影响记忆测试准确度；自适应训练缩短训练时间且不影响记忆。

Conclusion: 自适应训练能提高效率且不损害学习效果，支持在制造和军事等领域应用VR自适应系统。

Abstract: Objective: The study examined the effects of varying all three core elements
of cognitive load on learning efficiency during a shape assembly task in
virtual reality (VR).
  Background: Adaptive training systems aim to improve learning efficiency and
retention by dynamically adjusting difficulty. However, design choices can
impact the cognitive workload imposed on the learner. The present experiments
examined how aspects of cognitive load impact training outcomes.
  Method: Participants learned step-by-step shape assembly in a VR environment.
Cognitive load was manipulated across three dimensions: Intrinsic Load (shape
complexity), Extraneous Load (instruction verbosity), and Germane Load
(adaptive vs. fixed training). In adaptive training (experiment 1), difficulty
increased based on individual performance. In fixed training (experiment 2),
difficulty followed a preset schedule from a yoked participant.
  Results: Higher Intrinsic Load significantly increased training times and
subjective workload but did not affect retention test accuracy. Extraneous Load
modestly impacted training time, with little impact on workload or retention.
Adaptive training shortened overall training time without increasing workload
or impairing retention. No interactions were observed between the three types
of load. Conclusion: Both Intrinsic and Extraneous Load increased training
time, but adaptive training improved efficiency without harming retention. The
lack of interaction between the elements suggests training benefits can be
worth seeking within any of the components of cognitive load. Application:
These findings support the use of VR adaptive systems in domains such as
manufacturing and military service, where efficient assembly skill acquisition
is critical. Tailoring difficulty in real-time can optimize efficiency without
compromising learning.

training, screening, and teleoperation. This framework provides a methodology
and components that streamline the development of adaptive real-time virtual
immersive systems. It contains multimodal measurements - declarative in the
form of in-VR questionnaires and objective, including eye tracking, body
movement, and psychophysiological data (e.g., ECG, GSR, PPG). A key focus of
this paper is the integration of real-time eye tracking data into XR
environments to facilitate a biofeedback loop, providing insight into user
attention, cognitive load, and engagement. Given the relatively high
measurement frequency of eye tracking - recognized as a noninvasive yet robust
psychophysiological measure - this technology is particularly well suited for
real-time adjustments in task difficulty and feedback to enhance learning and
operational effectiveness. Despite its established role in cognitive and
attentional studies, implementing eye tracking metrics within dynamic,
real-time XR environments poses unique challenges, particularly given the
complex moving visuals presented in head-mounted displays (HMDs). This paper
addresses these challenges by focusing on the essential aspects of integrating
eye tracking in immersive systems based on real-time engines, ultimately
facilitating more efficient, adaptive XR applications.

integrating this process to develop an interactive data analytics interface for
highway traffic engineers to effectively retrieve and analyze historical
traffic data. With generative UIs, the team was able to elicit rich user
feedback and test multiple alternative design ideas from user evaluation
interviews and real-time collaborative sessions with domain experts. We discuss
the advantages and pitfalls of vibe coding for bridging the gaps between design
expertise and domain-specific expertise.

*David Bauer,Qi Wu,Hamid Gadirov,Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于路径追踪的体积渲染新方法，通过动态训练的辐射缓存技术，显著提升渲染质量并保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学可视化中，真实感渲染技术面临渲染速度慢和像素方差高的挑战，需要一种高效解决方案。

Method: 采用3D高斯散射作为多级路径空间辐射缓存，动态适应场景参数变化。

Result: 相比基线路径追踪器和神经辐射缓存，新方法在保持计算效率的同时显著提升图像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法易于集成，为体积可视化应用提供了一种高效的渲染质量提升方案。

Abstract: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in
entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization,
volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and
interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have
gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant
challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and
high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we
introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.
Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D
Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.
This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to
changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer
functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality
images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare
it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event
estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space
radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly
enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while
maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于无约束照片集合的开放词汇场景理解框架，结合语言嵌入的3D高斯泼溅技术，实现了对建筑风格和结构的沉浸式理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前利用互联网照片进行3D重建的技术主要集中在虚拟探索地标和古迹，而对建筑风格和结构知识的沉浸式理解仍局限于静态图文浏览。

Method: 扩展语言嵌入的3D高斯泼溅技术，提出多外观CLIP特征提取、语言特征不确定性图引导优化、瞬态不确定性感知自编码器等方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在开放词汇分割任务上优于现有方法，支持交互式漫游查询、建筑风格识别和3D场景编辑。

Conclusion: 该框架为无约束照片集合的开放词汇场景理解提供了有效解决方案，推动了建筑风格和结构的沉浸式探索。

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D
reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and
historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the
immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which
remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we
draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use
unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for
understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we
extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel
framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo
collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the
same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance
field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language
feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the
multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,
we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance
language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively
compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,
to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark
dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained
photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling
applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries,
architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

TL;DR: ChoreoMuse是一个基于扩散模型的框架，用于生成高质量、风格可控的舞蹈视频，适应多种音乐风格和舞者特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代艺术制作需要自动化编舞生成，但现有方法难以同时满足音乐节奏和用户定义编舞风格的要求。

Method: 使用SMPL格式参数作为音乐与视频生成的中间媒介，结合MotionTune音乐编码器捕捉音频运动线索。

Result: ChoreoMuse在视频质量、节奏对齐、舞蹈多样性和风格一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ChoreoMuse是一个强大的解决方案，适用于广泛的创意应用。

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography
generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer
characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance
videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography
styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To
address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that
uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries
between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints
imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports
style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical
genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to
handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel
music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the
generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the
input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match
both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that
measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments
confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style
adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of
creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page:

Conclusion: 神经壳纹理方法有效解决了高斯泼溅技术中基元数量过多的问题，同时保持了高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting techniques have shown promising results in novel view
synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high
reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of
primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of
geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a
neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information
around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric
representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture
features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this
disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail
reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using
significantly fewer primitives.

Conclusion: 该方法超越了现有技术，为数字孪生应用提供了敏捷的解决方案，减少了专家依赖和成本。

Abstract: This article presents an innovative methodology for locating injection points
in injection-molded parts using intelligent models with geometric algorithms
for discrete topologies. The first algorithm calculates the center of mass of
the discrete model based on the center of mass of each triangular facet in the
system, ensuring uniform molten plastic distribution during mold cavity
filling. Two sub-algorithms intelligently evaluate the geometry and optimal
injection point location. The first sub-algorithm generates a geometric matrix
based on a two-dimensional nodal quadrature adapted to the part's bounding box.
The second sub-algorithm projects the nodal matrix and associated circular
areas orthogonally on the part's surface along the demolding direction. The
optimal injection point location is determined by minimizing the distance to
the center of mass from the first algorithm's result. This novel methodology
has been validated through rheological simulations in six case studies with
complex geometries. The results demonstrate uniform and homogeneous molten
plastic distribution with minimal pressure loss during the filling phase.
Importantly, this methodology does not require expert intervention, reducing
time and costs associated with manual injection mold feed system design. It is
also adaptable to various design environments and virtual twin systems, not
tied to specific CAD software. The validated results surpass the state of the
art, offering an agile alternative for digital twin applications in new product
design environments, reducing dependence on experts, facilitating designer
training, and ultimately cutting costs

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian representations (3DGS) have proven effective for modeling
the geometry and appearance of objects, their potential for capturing other
physical attributes-such as sound-remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
present a novel framework dubbed SonicGauss for synthesizing impact sounds from
3DGS representations by leveraging their inherent geometric and material
properties. Specifically, we integrate a diffusion-based sound synthesis model

ellipsoids. Our approach supports spatially varying sound responses conditioned
on impact locations and generalizes across a wide range of object categories.
Experiments on the ObjectFolder dataset and real-world recordings demonstrate
that our method produces realistic, position-aware auditory feedback. The
results highlight the framework's robustness and generalization ability,
offering a promising step toward bridging 3D visual representations and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本方法在音频分类中表现有限，尤其是当类别包含多样声音时，文本描述难以优化。

Method: 通过将音频嵌入按类别分组并处理，替代噪声较大的文本嵌入。

Result: 少样本分类通常优于零样本基线。

Conclusion: 少样本方法能有效提升音频分类性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art audio classification often employs a zero-shot approach,
which involves comparing audio embeddings with embeddings from text describing
the respective audio class. These embeddings are usually generated by neural
networks trained through contrastive learning to align audio and text
representations. Identifying the optimal text description for an audio class is
challenging, particularly when the class comprises a wide variety of sounds.
This paper examines few-shot methods designed to improve classification
accuracy beyond the zero-shot approach. Specifically, audio embeddings are
grouped by class and processed to replace the inherently noisy text embeddings.
Our results demonstrate that few-shot classification typically outperforms the
zero-shot baseline.

Motivation: 解决CNN在建模全局上下文时的局限性，以及Transformer模型的高计算需求。

Method: 结合CNN和轻量级自注意力机制，引入FBS模块抑制噪声和非信息频率区域，并开发年龄特异性模型。

Result: 在SPRSound和ICBHI数据集上达到新基准，计算量减少50%。

Conclusion: CNN-TSA框架适合资源受限环境下的实时呼吸音分析。

Abstract: Accurate classification of respiratory sounds requires deep learning models
that effectively capture fine-grained acoustic features and long-range temporal
dependencies. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for
extracting local time-frequency patterns but are limited in modeling global
context. In contrast, transformer-based models can capture long-range
dependencies, albeit with higher computational demands. To address these
limitations, we propose a compact CNN-Temporal Self-Attention (CNN-TSA) network
that integrates lightweight self-attention into an efficient CNN backbone.
Central to our approach is a Frequency Band Selection (FBS) module that
suppresses noisy and non-informative frequency regions, substantially improving
accuracy and reducing FLOPs by up to 50%. We also introduce age-specific models
to enhance robustness across diverse patient groups. Evaluated on the
SPRSound-2022/2023 and ICBHI-2017 lung sound datasets, CNN-TSA with FBS sets
new benchmarks on SPRSound and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICBHI,
all with a significantly smaller computational footprint. Furthermore,
integrating FBS into an existing transformer baseline yields a new record on
ICBHI, confirming FBS as an effective drop-in enhancement. These results
demonstrate that our framework enables reliable, real-time respiratory sound
analysis suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved symbolic
music generation. However, most approaches rely on transformer-based
architectures with self-attention mechanisms, which are constrained by
quadratic computational complexity, limiting scalability for long sequences. To
address this, we propose Symbolic Music Diffusion with Mamba (SMDIM), a novel
diffusion-based architecture integrating Structured State Space Models (SSMs)
for efficient global context modeling and the Mamba-FeedForward-Attention Block
(MFA) for precise local detail preservation. The MFA Block combines the linear
complexity of Mamba layers, the non-linear refinement of FeedForward layers,
and the fine-grained precision of self-attention mechanisms, achieving a
balance between scalability and musical expressiveness. SMDIM achieves
near-linear complexity, making it highly efficient for long-sequence tasks.
Evaluated on diverse datasets, including FolkDB, a collection of traditional
Chinese folk music that represents an underexplored domain in symbolic music
generation, SMDIM outperforms state-of-the-art models in both generation

Motivation: 随着ZS-TTS技术的快速发展，高保真语音合成可能引发隐私和伦理问题，但目前缺乏从预训练模型中移除特定说话人知识的研究。

Method: 提出了教师引导遗忘（TGU）框架，通过引入随机性防止模型复制被遗忘说话人的声音，并设计了新的评估指标spk-ZRF。

Result: 实验表明，TGU能有效阻止模型复制被遗忘说话人的声音，同时保持对其他说话人语音的高质量生成。

Conclusion: TGU为ZS-TTS系统提供了一种有效的说话人身份遗忘方法，解决了隐私保护问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (ZS-TTS) technology has
enabled high-fidelity voice synthesis from minimal audio cues, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. Despite the threats to voice privacy,
research to selectively remove the knowledge to replicate unwanted individual
voices from pre-trained model parameters has not been explored. In this paper,
we address the new challenge of speaker identity unlearning for ZS-TTS systems.
To meet this goal, we propose the first machine unlearning frameworks for
ZS-TTS, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), designed to ensure the
model forgets designated speaker identities while retaining its ability to
generate accurate speech for other speakers. Our proposed methods incorporate
randomness to prevent consistent replication of forget speakers' voices,
assuring unlearned identities remain untraceable. Additionally, we propose a
new evaluation metric, speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF). This assesses
the model's ability to disregard prompts associated with forgotten speakers,
effectively neutralizing its knowledge of these voices. The experiments
conducted on the state-of-the-art model demonstrate that TGU prevents the model
from replicating forget speakers' voices while maintaining high quality for
other speakers. The demo is available at https://speechunlearn.github.io/

Conclusion: SI-SDA高效且适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Recent audio LLMs have emerged rapidly, demonstrating strong generalization
across various speech tasks. However, given the inherent complexity of speech
signals, these models inevitably suffer from performance degradation in
specific target domains. To address this, we focus on enhancing audio LLMs in
target domains without any labeled data. We propose a self-improvement method
called SI-SDA, leveraging the information embedded in large-model decoding to
evaluate the quality of generated pseudo labels and then perform domain
adaptation based on reinforcement learning optimization. Experimental results
show that our method consistently and significantly improves audio LLM
performance, outperforming existing baselines in WER and BLEU across multiple
public datasets of automatic speech recognition (ASR), spoken

our approach exhibits high data efficiency, underscoring its potential for

Conclusion: 联合建模波形和谱特征可生成鲁棒、领域无关的表示，有效检测音频深度伪造。

Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic speech have made audio deepfakes increasingly
realistic, posing significant security risks. Existing detection methods that
rely on a single modality, either raw waveform embeddings or spectral based
features, are vulnerable to non spoof disturbances and often overfit to known
forgery algorithms, resulting in poor generalization to unseen attacks. To
address these shortcomings, we investigate hybrid fusion frameworks that
integrate self supervised learning (SSL) based representations with handcrafted
spectral descriptors (MFCC , LFCC, CQCC). By aligning and combining
complementary information across modalities, these fusion approaches capture
subtle artifacts that single feature approaches typically overlook. We explore
several fusion strategies, including simple concatenation, cross attention,
mutual cross attention, and a learnable gating mechanism, to optimally blend
SSL features with fine grained spectral cues. We evaluate our approach on four
challenging public benchmarks and report generalization performance. All fusion
variants consistently outperform an SSL only baseline, with the cross attention
strategy achieving the best generalization with a 38% relative reduction in
equal error rate (EER). These results confirm that joint modeling of waveform
and spectral views produces robust, domain agnostic representations for audio
deepfake detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频效果链的顺序对最终声音有重要影响，但现有研究多集中于效果类型和参数的估计，忽略了顺序的重要性。

Method: 使用神经网络将湿信号嵌入双曲空间，利用双曲空间的指数扩展特性高效表示树结构数据（如音频效果链），并进行分类。

Conclusion: 双曲空间更适合建模音频效果链的非交换性和指数增长特性，为音频效果链识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio effects (AFXs) are essential tools in music production, frequently
applied in chains to shape timbre and dynamics. The order of AFXs in a chain
plays a crucial role in determining the final sound, particularly when
non-linear (e.g., distortion) or time-variant (e.g., chorus) processors are
involved. Despite its importance, most AFX-related studies have primarily
focused on estimating effect types and their parameters from a wet signal. To
address this gap, we formulate AFX chain recognition as the task of jointly
estimating AFX types and their order from a wet signal. We propose a
neural-network-based method that embeds wet signals into a hyperbolic space and
classifies their AFX chains. Hyperbolic space can represent tree-structured
data more efficiently than Euclidean space due to its exponential expansion
property. Since AFX chains can be represented as trees, with AFXs as nodes and
edges encoding effect order, hyperbolic space is well-suited for modeling the
exponentially growing and non-commutative nature of ordered AFX combinations,
where changes in effect order can result in different final sounds. Experiments
using guitar sounds demonstrate that, with an appropriate curvature, the
proposed method outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Further analysis based
on AFX type and chain length highlights the effectiveness of the proposed
method in capturing AFX order.

Abstract: Despite the rapid development of neural vocoders in recent years, they
usually suffer from some intrinsic challenges like opaque modeling, and
parameter-performance trade-off. In this study, we propose an innovative
time-frequency (T-F) domain-based neural vocoder to resolve the above-mentioned
challenges. To be specific, we bridge the connection between the classical
signal range-null decomposition (RND) theory and vocoder task, and the
reconstruction of target spectrogram can be decomposed into the superimposition
between the range-space and null-space, where the former is enabled by a linear
domain shift from the original mel-scale domain to the target linear-scale
domain, and the latter is instantiated via a learnable network for further
spectral detail generation. Accordingly, we propose a novel dual-path
framework, where the spectrum is hierarchically encoded/decoded, and the cross-
and narrow-band modules are elaborately devised for efficient sub-band and
sequential modeling. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the LJSpeech
and LibriTTS benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative results show that while
enjoying lightweight network parameters, the proposed approach yields
state-of-the-art performance among existing advanced methods. Our code and the
pretrained model weights are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词到歌曲生成模型缺乏词级控制能力，无法满足音乐工作者的需求。

Method: 采用流匹配技术实现词级时间和持续控制，并通过直接偏好优化（DPO）进行美学对齐。

Result: JAM模型在音乐特定属性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: JAM为歌词到歌曲生成提供了更精细的控制和更高的质量，同时通过公开数据集JAME标准化了评估。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic
text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable
of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and
acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative
audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open
lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an
acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However,
these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by
musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our
flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing
and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control.
To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human
preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference
Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset,
eliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to
standardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public
evaluation dataset JAME. We show that JAM outperforms the existing models in
terms of the music-specific attributes.

TL;DR: Music Arena是一个开放平台，用于文本到音乐（TTM）模型的可扩展人类偏好评估，通过实时用户反馈和标准化协议解决现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类偏好评估方法成本高且难以比较，缺乏开放的偏好数据来源，Music Arena旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 平台允许用户输入文本提示并比较两个TTM系统的输出，收集偏好数据，包括详细反馈和隐私保护的数据发布策略。

Result: Music Arena通过标准化协议、透明数据政策和音乐特定功能，解决了TTM生态系统中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: 该平台展示了如何针对特定AI领域的独特特性，设计实时评估系统。

Abstract: We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference
evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via
listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies
are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may
differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align
their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and
renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these
gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users
input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems,
and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena
follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with
key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the
heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed*
preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also
propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a
renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency.
Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies,
and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in
the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully
adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频谱拍卖的固定竞价和匹配机制限制了参与者策略调整能力，导致动态频谱共享环境中社会福利次优。

Method: 引入可调整需求范围的组合竞价和频谱等效映射系数（SEM），采用贪心匹配算法动态优化频谱分配。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案在动态频谱共享场景中显著优于现有基准方法，社会福利显著提高。

Conclusion: 灵活的竞价机制和动态优化策略能有效提升频谱拍卖的效率和公平性。

Abstract: Traditional combinatorial spectrum auctions mainly rely on fixed bidding and
matching processes, which limit participants' ability to adapt their strategies
and often result in suboptimal social welfare in dynamic spectrum sharing
environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approximately
truthful combinatorial forward auction scheme with a flexible bidding mechanism
aimed at enhancing resource efficiency and maximizing social welfare. In the
proposed scheme, each buyer submits a combinatorial bid consisting of the base
spectrum demand and adjustable demand ranges, enabling the auctioneer to
dynamically optimize spectrum allocation in response to market conditions. To
standardize the valuation across heterogeneous frequency bands, we introduce a
Spectrum Equivalent Mapping (SEM) coefficient. A greedy matching algorithm is
employed to determine winning bids by sorting buyers based on their equivalent
unit bid prices and allocating resources within supply constraints. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed flexible bidding mechanism significantly
outperforms existing benchmark methods, achieving notably higher social welfare
in dynamic spectrum sharing scenarios.

Abstract: Consider costly tasks that add up to the success of a project, and must be
fitted by an agent into a given time-frame. This is an instance of the classic
budgeted maximization problem, which admits an approximation scheme (FPTAS).
Now assume the agent is performing these tasks on behalf of a principal, who is
the one to reap the rewards if the project succeeds. The principal must design
a contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In
this work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which
transforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization)
to tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach
diverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an
assumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.
  We first show how to "lift" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the
best-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design
problem. We establish this through our "local-global" framework, in which the
"local" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of
the demand problem. The "global" step then utilizes the local one to find the
approximately optimal contract. We apply our framework to a host of
combinatorial constraints including multi-dimensional budgets, budgeted
matroid, and budgeted matching constraints. In all cases we achieve an
approximation essentially matching the best approximation for the purely
algorithmic problem. We also develop a method to tackle multi-agent contract
settings, where the team of working agents must abide to combinatorial
feasibility constraints.

Motivation: 模拟实际场景（如班次分配或团队组建），探索公平分配的新概念及其可行性。

Method: 提出基于翻转的公平性概念（EFF1/EFFX），分析标准技术的局限性，并设计基于共同排名和Nash福利的算法。

Result: 在共同排名下实现常数近似保证，Nash福利算法提供1/2-EFF1分配且紧。

Conclusion: 翻转公平性与经典EFX存在显著差异，部分场景下可实现近似公平分配。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods under cardinality
constraints, where each agent must receive a bundle of fixed size. This models
practical scenarios, such as assigning shifts or forming equally sized teams.
Recently, variants of envy-freeness up to one/any item (EF1, EFX) were
introduced for this setting, based on flips or exchanges of items. Namely, one
can define envy-freeness up to one/any flip (EFF1, EFFX), meaning that an agent
$i$ does not envy another agent $j$ after performing one or any one-item flip
between their bundles that improves the value of $i$.
  We explore algorithmic aspects of this notion, and our contribution is
twofold: we present both algorithmic and impossibility results, highlighting a
stark contrast between the classic EFX concept and its flip-based analogue.
First, we explore standard techniques used in the literature and show that they
fail to guarantee EFFX approximations. On the positive side, we show that we
can achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee when agents share a
common ranking over item values, based on the well-known envy cycle elimination
technique. This idea also leads to a generalized algorithm with approximation
guarantees when agents agree on the top $n$ items and their valuation functions
are bounded. Finally, we show that an algorithm that maximizes the Nash welfare
guarantees a 1/2-EFF1 allocation, and that this bound is tight.

Result: 基于效用的可视化减少了投标者的认知负担，但投标者仍会低估投标。仪表板机制若假设投标者完全理性或风险中性，会导致推断误差。

Conclusion: 需结合行为响应模型设计仪表板，以提升推断准确性并优化实际分配效果。

Abstract: Visualization dashboards are increasingly used in strategic settings like
auctions to enhance decision-making and reduce strategic confusion. This paper
presents behavioral experiments evaluating how different dashboard designs
affect bid optimization in reverse first-price auctions. Additionally, we
assess how dashboard designs impact the auction designer's ability to
accurately infer bidders' preferences within the dashboard mechanism framework.
We compare visualizations of the bid allocation rule, commonly deployed in
practice, to alternatives that display expected utility. We find that
utility-based visualizations significantly improve bidding by reducing
cognitive demands on bidders. However, even with improved dashboards, bidders
systematically under-shade their bids, driven by an implicit preference for
certain wins in uncertain settings. As a result, dashboard-based mechanisms
that assume fully rational or risk-neutral bidder responses to dashboards can
produce significant estimation errors when inferring private preferences, which
may lead to suboptimal allocations in practice. Explicitly modeling agents'
behavioral responses to dashboards substantially improves inference accuracy,
highlighting the need to align visualization design and econometric inference
assumptions in practice.

Result: 在多种数据集上表现优异，同时保持了低能耗特性。

Conclusion: 自适应重置神经元有效解决了信息丢失问题，提升了性能，适用于低能耗场景。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due
to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their
inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold
level and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number
and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,
while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In
response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the
correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet
effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on
various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

Abstract: This paper preliminarily investigates the duality between flow matching in
generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary
computation. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the intrinsic connections
between these two approaches in terms of their mathematical formulations and
optimization mechanisms: the vector field learning in flow matching shares
similar mathematical expressions with the velocity update rules in PSO; both
methods follow the fundamental framework of progressive evolution from initial
to target distributions; and both can be formulated as dynamical systems
governed by ordinary differential equations. Our study demonstrates that flow
matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO, while PSO
provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This
duality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel
hybrid algorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods.
Although this paper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed
correspondences suggest several promising research directions, including
improving swarm intelligence algorithms based on flow matching principles and
enhancing generative models using swarm intelligence concepts.

Result: MPaGE在性能上优于现有LLM框架，与传统MOEAs竞争且运行更快。

Conclusion: MPaGE为多目标优化提供了一种高效且多样化的新方法。

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise
in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of
conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be
effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter
tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently,
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has
opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced
language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most
existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often
neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic
diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a
novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO)
framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By
partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing
candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize
heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus
promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through
extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing
LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional
Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster
runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

Abstract: Many real-world systems, such as transportation systems, ecological systems,
and Internet systems, are complex systems. As an important tool for studying
complex systems, computational experiments can map them into artificial society
models that are computable and reproducible within computers, thereby providing
digital and computational methods for quantitative analysis. In current
research, the construction of individual agent models often ignores the
long-term accumulative effect of memory mechanisms in the development process
of agents, which to some extent causes the constructed models to deviate from
the real characteristics of real-world systems. To address this challenge, this
paper proposes an individual agent model based on a memory-learning
collaboration mechanism, which implements hierarchical modeling of the memory
mechanism and a multi-indicator evaluation mechanism. Through hierarchical
modeling of the individual memory repository, the group memory repository, and
the memory buffer pool, memory can be effectively managed, and knowledge
sharing and dissemination between individuals and groups can be promoted. At
the same time, the multi-indicator evaluation mechanism enables dynamic
evaluation of memory information, allowing dynamic updates of information in
the memory set and promoting collaborative decision-making between memory and
learning. Experimental results show that, compared with existing memory
modeling methods, the agents constructed by the proposed model demonstrate
better decision-making quality and adaptability within the system. This
verifies the effectiveness of the individual agent model based on the
memory-learning collaboration mechanism proposed in this paper in improving the
quality of individual-level modeling in artificial society modeling and
achieving anthropomorphic characteristics.

Motivation: 自主泊车（AP）因空间限制、频繁障碍物交互和安全要求而复杂，传统方法缺乏适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出RARLAP框架，设计了三种结构化奖励策略（GOR、DPR、MAR），并在Unity仿真环境中训练。

Result: 实验显示，MAR策略成功率达91%，轨迹更平滑且行为更鲁棒，优于GOR和DPR。

Conclusion: RARLAP通过奖励增强有效解决了自主泊车的复杂性问题，支持可扩展和高效的政策优化。

Abstract: Autonomous parking (AP) represents a critical yet complex subset of
intelligent vehicle automation, characterized by tight spatial constraints,
frequent close-range obstacle interactions, and stringent safety margins.
However, conventional rule-based and model-predictive methods often lack the
adaptability and generalization needed to handle the nonlinear and
environment-dependent complexities of AP. To address these limitations, we
propose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates
the inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured
reward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely
within a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We
systematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only
reward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward
(MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization
paradigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a
91\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior,
while GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory
analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability,
accelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall,

TL;DR: GABRIL是一种利用人类注视数据改进模仿学习的方法，通过正则化损失减少因果混淆，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习（IL）常因因果混淆问题在测试环境中表现不佳，需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: GABRIL利用人类注视数据设计正则化损失，引导模型关注因果相关特征。

Result: 在Atari和CARLA环境中，GABRIL分别比基线方法提升了179%和76%。

Conclusion: GABRIL不仅提升了性能，还增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

*Haoze Dong,Meng Guo,Chengyi He,Zhongkui Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种分布式轨迹规划框架，通过全局路径和局部轨迹协作解决多智能体在密集环境中的死锁问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体轨迹规划中，死锁问题在密集障碍物环境中尤为突出，尤其是在狭窄走廊中。

Method: 全局层面采用同伦感知的最优路径规划算法，局部层面使用模型预测控制进行轨迹优化，并结合在线重规划策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了死锁，成功率从4%-13%提升至90%以上。

Conclusion: 通过时间感知的同伦特性，该方法有效解决了多智能体轨迹规划中的死锁问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory planning requires ensuring both safety and efficiency,
yet deadlocks remain a significant challenge, especially in obstacle-dense
environments. Such deadlocks frequently occur when multiple agents attempt to
traverse the same long and narrow corridor simultaneously. To address this, we
propose a novel distributed trajectory planning framework that bridges the gap
between global path and local trajectory cooperation. At the global level, a
homotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm is proposed, which fully
leverages the topological structure of the environment. A reference path is
chosen from distinct homotopy classes by considering both its spatial and
temporal properties, leading to improved coordination among agents globally. At
the local level, a model predictive control-based trajectory optimization
method is used to generate dynamically feasible and collision-free
trajectories. Additionally, an online replanning strategy ensures its
adaptability to dynamic environments. Simulations and experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in mitigating deadlocks. Ablation studies
demonstrate that by incorporating time-aware homotopic properties into the
underlying global paths, our method can significantly reduce deadlocks and
improve the average success rate from 4%-13% to over 90% in randomly generated
dense scenarios.

TL;DR: RAKOMO是一种结合K-Order Markov Optimization（KOMO）和基于可达区域的运动规划技术，用于解决腿式机械臂的运动规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腿式机械臂（如配备机械臂的四足机器人）的运动规划需要处理复杂的运动学约束和接触不连续性，传统方法常因计算限制忽略腿部约束。

Method: 提出RAKOMO，将KOMO与基于神经网络预测的可达区域（reachability margin）相结合，优化运动规划。

Result: RAKOMO在梯度优化中快速收敛，成功执行了四足机器人HyQReal的拾取-放置任务。

Conclusion: RAKOMO有效解决了腿式机械臂的运动规划问题，优于传统KOMO方法。

Abstract: Legged manipulators, such as quadrupeds equipped with robotic arms, require
motion planning techniques that account for their complex kinematic constraints
in order to perform manipulation tasks both safely and effectively. However,
trajectory optimization methods often face challenges due to the hybrid
dynamics introduced by contact discontinuities, and tend to neglect leg
limitations during planning for computational reasons. In this work, we propose
RAKOMO, a path optimization technique that integrates the strengths of K-Order
Markov Optimization (KOMO) with a kinematically-aware criterion based on the
reachable region defined as reachability margin. We leverage a neural-network
to predict the margin and optimize it by incorporating it in the standard KOMO
formulation. This approach enables rapid convergence of gradient-based motion
planning -- commonly tailored for continuous systems -- while adapting it
effectively to legged manipulators, successfully executing loco-manipulation
tasks. We benchmark RAKOMO against a baseline KOMO approach through a set of
simulations for pick-and-place tasks with the HyQReal quadruped robot equipped
with a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of future agent trajectories is a critical challenge for
ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation, particularly in complex
urban environments characterized by multiple plausible future scenarios. In
this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that integrates learning-based
with physics-based constraints to address the multi-modality inherent in
trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model
to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving
beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that
predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our
framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary
conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These
constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but
also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles.
Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory
predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in
autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive
ablation studies validate the contributions of each component and highlight
their synergistic impact on prediction accuracy and reliability. By balancing
data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, our approach offers a
robust and scalable solution for navigating the uncertainties of real-world
urban environments.

Abstract: Particle filter-based 2D-SLAM is widely used in indoor localization tasks due
to its efficiency. However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors
can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent
(DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to
address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning
frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2)
inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in
annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide
the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments.
Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can
dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization.
Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model
distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula
related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning
module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different
environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate
environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also
compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy
detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for utilizing skin sensors as a new
operation interface of complex robots. The skin sensors employed in this study
possess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple
contact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is
anticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions
exhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot
motion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by
altering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this
paper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing
recurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success
of this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for
software-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive
encoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy
and learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to
the classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to
mount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the
activation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of
measuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation
with other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated
by the robot's movements during deployment. Through these discoveries, the
accuracy of the developed classifier surpassed 95 %, enabling the dual-arm
mobile manipulator to execute a diverse range of tasks via the Skin-Machine
Interface. https://youtu.be/UjUXT4Z4BC8

Conclusion: Ag2x2为复杂双手机器人技能的可扩展学习提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation, fundamental to human daily activities, remains a
challenging task due to its inherent complexity of coordinated control. Recent
advances have enabled zero-shot learning of single-arm manipulation skills
through agent-agnostic visual representations derived from human videos;
however, these methods overlook crucial agent-specific information necessary
for bimanual coordination, such as end-effector positions. We propose Ag2x2, a
computational framework for bimanual manipulation through coordination-aware
visual representations that jointly encode object states and hand motion
patterns while maintaining agent-agnosticism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Ag2x2 achieves a 73.5% success rate across 13 diverse bimanual tasks from
Bi-DexHands and PerAct2, including challenging scenarios with deformable
objects like ropes. This performance outperforms baseline methods and even
surpasses the success rate of policies trained with expert-engineered rewards.
Furthermore, we show that representations learned through Ag2x2 can be
effectively leveraged for imitation learning, establishing a scalable pipeline
for skill acquisition without expert supervision. By maintaining robust
performance across diverse tasks without human demonstrations or engineered
rewards, Ag2x2 represents a step toward scalable learning of complex bimanual
robotic skills.

Abstract: 4D imaging radar is a type of low-cost millimeter-wave radar(costing merely
10-20$\%$ of lidar systems) capable of providing range, azimuth, elevation, and
Doppler velocity information. Accurate extrinsic calibration between
millimeter-wave radar and camera systems is critical for robust multimodal
perception in robotics, yet remains challenging due to inherent sensor noise
characteristics and complex error propagation. This paper presents a systematic
calibration framework to address critical challenges through a spatial 3d
uncertainty-aware PnP algorithm (3DUPnP) that explicitly models spherical
coordinate noise propagation in radar measurements, then compensating for
non-zero error expectations during coordinate transformations. Finally,
experimental validation demonstrates significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art CPnP baseline, including improved consistency in simulations
and enhanced precision in physical experiments. This study provides a robust
calibration solution for robotic systems equipped with millimeter-wave radar
and cameras, tailored specifically for autonomous driving and robotic

Abstract: In many applications, robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured and
natural environments where they encounter various types of vegetation.
Vegetation presents unique challenges as a traversable obstacle, where the
mechanical properties of the plants can influence whether a robot can safely
collide with and overcome the obstacle. A more nuanced approach is required to
assess the safety and traversability of these obstacles, as collisions can
sometimes be safe and necessary for navigating through dense or unavoidable
vegetation. This paper introduces a novel sensor designed to directly measure
the applied forces exerted by vegetation on a robot: by directly capturing the
push-back forces, our sensor provides a detailed understanding of the
interactions between the robot and its surroundings. We demonstrate the
sensor's effectiveness through experimental validations, showcasing its ability
to measure subtle force variations. This force-based approach provides a
quantifiable metric that can inform navigation decisions and serve as a
foundation for developing future learning algorithms.

Abstract: Hand-eye calibration is an important task in vision-guided robotic systems
and is crucial for determining the transformation matrix between the camera
coordinate system and the robot end-effector. Existing methods, for multi-view
robotic systems, usually rely on accurate geometric models or manual
assistance, generalize poorly, and can be very complicated and inefficient.
Therefore, in this study, we propose PlaneHEC, a generalized hand-eye
calibration method that does not require complex models and can be accomplished
using only depth cameras, which achieves the optimal and fastest calibration
results using arbitrary planar surfaces like walls and tables. PlaneHEC
introduces hand-eye calibration equations based on planar constraints, which
makes it strongly interpretable and generalizable. PlaneHEC also uses a
comprehensive solution that starts with a closed-form solution and improves it
withiterative optimization, which greatly improves accuracy. We comprehensively
evaluated the performance of PlaneHEC in both simulated and real-world
environments and compared the results with other point-cloud-based calibration
methods, proving its superiority. Our approach achieves universal and fast
calibration with an innovative design of computational models, providing a
strong contribution to the development of multi-agent systems and embodied
intelligence.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的机器人系统多为开环规划，无法适应动态环境中的突发情况，限制了其实际应用。

Method: T-A-L框架通过“思考-行动-学习”的闭环循环，结合LLM的任务分解、执行反馈和自我反思，实现策略的持续优化。

Conclusion: T-A-L框架为开发更具鲁棒性和适应性的自主机器人提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current
systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners,
rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in
dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that
enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through
continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an
LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.
The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal
sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to
facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal
analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are
stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We
demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world
that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including
open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our
framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks,
converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits
remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant
step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic
agents.

Abstract: Autonomous driving promises safer roads, reduced congestion, and improved
mobility, yet validating these systems across diverse conditions remains a
major challenge. Real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes
unsafe, making large-scale validation impractical. In contrast, simulation
environments offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative for rigorous
verification and validation. A critical component of the validation process is
scenario generation, which involves designing and configuring traffic scenarios
to evaluate autonomous systems' responses to various events and uncertainties.
However, existing scenario generation tools often require programming
knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. To address this
limitation, we present an interactive, no-code framework for scenario
generation. Our framework features a graphical interface that enables users to
create, modify, save, load, and execute scenarios without needing coding
expertise or detailed simulation knowledge. Unlike script-based tools such as
Scenic or ScenarioRunner, our approach lowers the barrier to entry and supports
a broader user base. Central to our framework is a graph-based scenario
representation that facilitates structured management, supports both manual and
automated generation, and enables integration with deep learning-based scenario
and behavior generation methods. In automated mode, the framework can randomly
sample parameters such as actor types, behaviors, and environmental conditions,
allowing the generation of diverse and realistic test datasets. By simplifying
the scenario generation process, this framework supports more efficient testing
workflows and increases the accessibility of simulation-based validation for
researchers, engineers, and policymakers.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了扫描速度和精度，适用于工业表面检测等应用。

Abstract: Inspecting large-scale industrial surfaces like aircraft fuselages for
quality control requires capturing their precise 3D surface geometry at high
resolution. Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) offer high local resolution
but require slow 'press-and-lift' measurements stitched for large areas.
Approaches with sliding or roller/belt VBTS designs provide measurements
continuity. However, they face significant challenges respectively: sliding
struggles with friction/wear and both approaches are speed-limited by
conventional camera frame rates and motion blur, making large-area scanning
time consuming. Thus, a rapid, continuous, high-resolution method is needed. We
introduce a novel tactile sensor integrating a neuromorphic camera in a rolling
mechanism to achieve this. Leveraging its high temporal resolution and
robustness to motion blur, our system uses a modified event-based multi-view
stereo approach for 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate state-of-the-art scanning
speeds up to 0.5 m/s, achieving Mean Absolute Error below 100 microns -- 11
times faster than prior continuous tactile sensing methods. A multi-reference
Bayesian fusion strategy enhances accuracy (reducing MAE by 25.2\% compared to
EMVS) and mitigates curvature errors. We also validate high-speed feature
recognition via Braille reading 2.6 times faster than previous approaches.

Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing
limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion
framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human
inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network
(FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features
and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained
as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language
using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched
expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated
greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results
demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled
uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot
sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot
collaborative task performance.

Abstract: AI technologies, including deep learning, large-language models have gone
from one breakthrough to the other. As a result, we are witnessing growing
excitement in robotics at the prospect of leveraging the potential of AI to
tackle some of the outstanding barriers to the full deployment of robots in our
daily lives. However, action and sensing in the physical world pose greater and
different challenges than analysing data in isolation. As the development and
application of AI in robotic products advances, it is important to reflect on
which technologies, among the vast array of network architectures and learning
models now available in the AI field, are most likely to be successfully
applied to robots; how they can be adapted to specific robot designs, tasks,

assessment of what AI for robotics has achieved since the 1990s and proposes a
short- and medium-term research roadmap listing challenges and promises. These
range from keeping up-to-date large datasets, representatives of a diversity of
tasks robots may have to perform, and of environments they may encounter, to
designing AI algorithms tailored specifically to robotics problems but generic
enough to apply to a wide range of applications and transfer easily to a
variety of robotic platforms. For robots to collaborate effectively with
humans, they must predict human behavior without relying on bias-based
profiling. Explainability and transparency in AI-driven robot control are not
optional but essential for building trust, preventing misuse, and attributing
responsibility in accidents. We close on what we view as the primary long-term
challenges, that is, to design robots capable of lifelong learning, while
guaranteeing safe deployment and usage, and sustainable computational costs.

Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability
for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain
limited to specific tasks and clothes types, due to the complex,
high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation
with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes
manipulation over different clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long
dresses, ... , as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, ... .
The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., ''left sleeve'', ''right
shoulder'', etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient
for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably
extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate
representation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints
to bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high
level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the
semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a
simple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments
show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks
across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four
distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's
performance on a real robot.

Method: 开发了一个机器人物理模型，用于与几何粘性颗粒介质交互，测试了不同初始压缩状态下的机器人性能，并设计了拉伸测试装置。

Result: 机器人性能受初始压缩状态影响显著，运输质量变化高达75%。拉伸测试揭示了材料强度与初始压缩的关系。

Conclusion: 材料特性（如堆积和纠缠）对机器人操作至关重要，未来需进一步研究机器人与纠缠材料的交互机制。

Abstract: Construction throughout history typically assumes that its blueprints and
building blocks are pre-determined. However, recent work suggests that
alternative approaches can enable new paradigms for structure formation.
Aleatory architectures, or those which rely on the properties of their granular
building blocks rather than pre-planned design or computation, have thus far
relied on human intervention for their creation. We imagine that robotic swarms
could be valuable to create such aleatory structures by manipulating and
forming structures from entangled granular materials. To discover principles by
which robotic systems can effectively manipulate soft matter, we develop a
robophysical model for interaction with geometrically cohesive granular media
composed of u-shape particles. This robotic platform uses environmental signals
to autonomously coordinate excavation, transport, and deposition of material.
We test the effect of substrate initial conditions by characterizing robot
performance in two different material compaction states and observe as much as
a 75% change in transported mass depending on initial substrate compressive
loading. These discrepancies suggest the functional role that material
properties such as packing and cohesion/entanglement play in excavation and
construction. To better understand these material properties, we develop an
apparatus for tensile testing of the geometrically cohesive substrates, which
reveals how entangled material strength responds strongly to initial
compressive loading. These results explain the variation observed in robotic
performance and point to future directions for better understanding robotic
interaction mechanics with entangled materials.

Motivation: 磁触觉传感器（MBTS）设计紧凑且高频运行，但稀疏的触觉阵列限制了其空间分辨率。

Method: 提出SuperMag方法，通过条件变分自编码器从低分辨率MBTS输入推断高分辨率形状，利用同步采集的高分辨率视觉触觉传感器数据监督。

Result: MBTS采样频率达125 Hz，形状重建推理时间低于2.5 ms。

Conclusion: 跨模态协同提升了MBTS的触觉感知能力，有望在高精度机器人任务中发挥新作用。

Abstract: Magnetic-based tactile sensors (MBTS) combine the advantages of compact
design and high-frequency operation but suffer from limited spatial resolution
due to their sparse taxel arrays. This paper proposes SuperMag, a tactile shape
reconstruction method that addresses this limitation by leveraging
high-resolution vision-based tactile sensor (VBTS) data to supervise MBTS
super-resolution. Co-designed, open-source VBTS and MBTS with identical contact
modules enable synchronized data collection of high-resolution shapes and
magnetic signals via a symmetric calibration setup. We frame tactile shape
reconstruction as a conditional generative problem, employing a conditional
variational auto-encoder to infer high-resolution shapes from low-resolution
MBTS inputs. The MBTS achieves a sampling frequency of 125 Hz, whereas the
shape reconstruction sustains an inference time within 2.5 ms. This
cross-modality synergy advances tactile perception of the MBTS, potentially
unlocking its new capabilities in high-precision robotic tasks.

TL;DR: 论文通过简化导航方法（DWFE）和轻量级语言先验（SHF）验证了前沿几何而非LLM推理是导航成功的主要驱动力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型（LLM）在对象目标导航中的实际贡献，明确其是否真正提升了规划能力。

Method: 在HM3D-v1验证集上，首先用简单的距离加权前沿探索器（DWFE）替换复杂组件，随后加入轻量级语言先验（SHF）进行对比。

Result: DWFE将成功率从58.0%提升至61.1%，SPL从20.9%提升至36.0%；SHF进一步小幅提升性能并缩短路径。

Conclusion: 前沿几何而非LLM推理是导航成功的关键，需谨慎将导航成功归因于LLM智能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often credited with recent leaps in
ObjectGoal Navigation, yet the extent to which they improve planning remains
unclear. We revisit this question on the HM3D-v1 validation split. First, we
strip InstructNav of its Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation prompt, open-vocabulary
GLEE detector and Intuition saliency map, and replace them with a simple
Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE). This geometry-only heuristic raises
Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and lifts SPL from 20.9% to 36.0% over 2 000
validation episodes, outperforming all previous training-free baselines.
Second, we add a lightweight language prior (SHF); on a 200-episode subset this
yields a further +2% Success and +0.9% SPL while shortening paths by five steps
on average. Qualitative trajectories confirm the trend: InstructNav back-tracks
and times-out, DWFE reaches the goal after a few islands, and SHF follows an
almost straight route. Our results indicate that frontier geometry, not
emergent LLM reasoning, drives most reported gains, and suggest that
metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are necessary before
attributing navigation success to "LLM intelligence."

Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying
(FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and
must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is
challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a
verification and validation (V&V) process that bridges simulation and
real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified,
end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and
hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin
includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the
GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space
Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for
Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to
validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated
multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper
introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error
characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and
robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning
pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The
results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic
twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for
realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂实时可穿戴传感器系统奠定了基础，有望推动康复、机器人和外骨骼设计技术的发展。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations enable the accurate description and
analysis of the movement of biological systems with applications such as
rehabilitation assessment, prosthesis, and exoskeleton design. However, the
widespread usage of these techniques is limited by costly sensors,
laboratory-based setups, computationally demanding processes, and the use of
diverse software tools that often lack seamless integration. In this work, we
address these limitations by proposing an integrated, real-time framework for
musculoskeletal modeling and simulations that leverages OpenSimRT, the robotics
operating system (ROS), and wearable sensors. As a proof-of-concept, we
demonstrate that this framework can reasonably well describe inverse kinematics
of both lower and upper body using either inertial measurement units or
fiducial markers. Additionally, we show that it can effectively estimate
inverse dynamics of the ankle joint and muscle activations of major lower limb
muscles during daily activities, including walking, squatting and sit to stand,
stand to sit when combined with pressure insoles. We believe this work lays the
groundwork for further studies with more complex real-time and wearable
sensor-based human movement analysis systems and holds potential to advance
technologies in rehabilitation, robotics and exoskeleton designs.

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers
introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to
specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based
representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for
humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information
essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we
present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception
system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition
devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced
multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding
both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic
environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and
navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome
issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective
sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic
occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable
benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The
network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal
information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid
Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and
establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules,
paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex
real-world scenarios.

Result: 扫描路径映射的平均最近邻距离和Hausdorff距离误差分别为3.41 mm和3.65 mm，重建对象的误差为0.69 mm和2.2 mm。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了机器人超声系统在肋间成像中的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in clinical examinations due
to its portability, real-time capability, and radiation-free nature. To address
inter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained
increasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal
imaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation
method within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we
explore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib
structures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone
surface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related
signals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic
noise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile
point cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human
palpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,
the sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a
denser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an
image-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping
for individual patients. Additionally, to ensure full coverage of the object of
interest, we introduce an automated tilt angle adjustment method to visualize
structures beneath the bone. To validate the proposed method, we conducted
comprehensive experiments on four distinct phantoms. The final scanning
waypoint mapping achieved Mean Nearest Neighbor Distance (MNND) and Hausdorff
distance (HD) errors of 3.41 mm and 3.65 mm, respectively, while the
reconstructed object beneath the bone had errors of 0.69 mm and 2.2 mm compared
to the CT ground truth.

Conclusion: 方法有效且实用，适用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: Decentralized multi-agent navigation under uncertainty is a complex task that
arises in numerous robotic applications. It requires collision avoidance
strategies that account for both kinematic constraints, sensing and action
execution noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the
Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) with a probabilistic adaptation of
Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance. Our method ensures safe and efficient
multi-agent navigation by incorporating probabilistic safety constraints
directly into the MPPI sampling process via a Second-Order Cone Programming
formulation. This approach enables agents to operate independently using local
noisy observations while maintaining safety guarantees. We validate our
algorithm through extensive simulations with differential-drive robots and
benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods, including ORCA-DD and B-UAVC.
Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms them while achieving high
success rates, even in densely populated environments. Additionally, validation
in the Gazebo simulator confirms its practical applicability to robotic
platforms.

Abstract: Robotic platforms have become essential for marine operations by providing
regular and continuous access to offshore assets, such as underwater
infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and resource exploration.
However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments,
characterized by limited visibility, unpredictable currents, and communication
constraints, presents significant challenges that demand advanced autonomy
while ensuring operator trust and oversight. Central to addressing these
challenges are knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, particularly
knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, that enable
robots to efficiently structure, retrieve, and interpret complex environmental
data. These capabilities empower robotic agents to reason, adapt, and respond
effectively to changing conditions. The primary goal of this work is to
demonstrate both multi-agent autonomy and shared autonomy, where multiple
robotic agents operate independently while remaining connected to a human
supervisor. We show how a RAG-powered large language model, augmented with
knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, enables autonomous multi-agent
decision-making and facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, resulting in
100\% mission validation and behavior completeness. Finally, ablation studies
reveal that without structured knowledge from the graph and/or taxonomy, the
LLM is prone to hallucinations, which can compromise decision quality.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation of quadrupedal robots has broadened robotic applications,
but using legs as manipulators often compromises locomotion, while mounting
arms complicates the system. To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism
for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions
with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind
legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this
inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is
dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the
coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive
experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over
baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates
the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle
probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging
dynamics and external disturbances.

Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained increasing attention in recent years, as a safe
environment to accelerate the development of motion planning and control
methods for autonomous driving. Deep learning models, predominantly based on
neural networks (NNs), have demonstrated significant potential in modeling the
vehicle dynamics and in performing various tasks in autonomous driving.
However, their black-box nature is critical in the context of autonomous
racing, where safety and robustness demand a thorough understanding of the
decision-making algorithms. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
MS-NN-steer, a new Model-Structured Neural Network for vehicle steering
control, integrating the prior knowledge of the nonlinear vehicle dynamics into
the neural architecture. The proposed controller is validated using real-world
data from the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) competition, with
full-scale autonomous race cars. In comparison with general-purpose NNs,
MS-NN-steer is shown to achieve better accuracy and generalization with small
training datasets, while being less sensitive to the weights' initialization.
Also, MS-NN-steer outperforms the steering controller used by the A2RL winning
team. Our implementation is available open-source in a GitHub repository.

Abstract: Learning physical interaction skills, such as dancing, handshaking, or
sparring, remains a fundamental challenge for agents operating in human
environments, particularly when the agent's morphology differs significantly
from that of the demonstrator. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted
objectives or morphological similarity, limiting their capacity for
generalization. Here, we introduce a framework that enables agents with diverse
embodiments to learn wholebbody interaction behaviors directly from human
demonstrations. The framework extracts a compact, transferable representation
of interaction dynamics, called the Embedded Interaction Graph (EIG), which
captures key spatiotemporal relationships between the interacting agents. This
graph is then used as an imitation objective to train control policies in
physics-based simulations, allowing the agent to generate motions that are both
semantically meaningful and physically feasible. We demonstrate BuddyImitation
on multiple agents, such as humans, quadrupedal robots with manipulators, or
mobile manipulators and various interaction scenarios, including sparring,
handshaking, rock-paper-scissors, or dancing. Our results demonstrate a
promising path toward coordinated behaviors across morphologically distinct
characters via cross embodiment interaction learning.

Abstract: With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work
focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have
explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts
are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and
lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,
this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework
of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive
compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,
the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a
reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the
unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.
Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided
adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive
control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world
environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms
traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity
compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and
reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator
enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical
derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,
adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying
LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and

Abstract: The unification of disparate maps is crucial for enabling scalable robot
operation across multiple sessions and collaborative multi-robot scenarios.
However, achieving a unified map robust to sensor modalities and dynamic
environments remains a challenging problem. Variations in LiDAR types and
dynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene
consistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure
detection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging
framework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,
dynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A
voxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify
and reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal
module is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved
static local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic
environments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are
conducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a
centralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during
map merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph
optimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for
globally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse
real-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing
superior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping
in dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing
methods. Project Page: https://sparolab.github.io/research/uni_mapper.

Conclusion: 研究展示了分析和深度学习方法在复杂桁架环境中的潜力，为未来自主基础设施检查提供了指导。

Abstract: Reticular structures form the backbone of major infrastructure like bridges,
pylons, and airports, but their inspection and maintenance are costly and
hazardous, often requiring human intervention. While prior research has focused
on fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous
navigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study
addresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss
structures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces
several approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus
background from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into
two categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical
approach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the
eigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced
deep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3
are trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that
the analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance
comparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally
intensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves
a Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the
promise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous
navigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs
between computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing
valuable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous
infrastructure inspection and maintenance.

Conclusion: FMimic显著提升了模仿学习的性能，尤其在细粒度和长时任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Visual imitation learning (VIL) provides an efficient and intuitive strategy
for robotic systems to acquire novel skills. Recent advancements in foundation
models, particularly Vision Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in visual and linguistic reasoning for VIL tasks.
Despite this progress, existing approaches primarily utilize these models for
learning high-level plans from human demonstrations, relying on pre-defined
motion primitives for executing physical interactions, which remains a major
bottleneck for robotic systems. In this work, we present FMimic, a novel
paradigm that harnesses foundation models to directly learn generalizable
skills at even fine-grained action levels, using only a limited number of human
videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FMimic delivers strong
performance with a single human video, and significantly outperforms all other
methods with five videos. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant
improvements of over 39% and 29% in RLBench multi-task experiments and
real-world manipulation tasks, respectively, and exceeds baselines by more than
34% in high-precision tasks and 47% in long-horizon tasks.

tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to
conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and
improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced
autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential
for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative

Abstract: Situationally-aware artificial agents operating with competence in natural
environments face several challenges: spatial awareness, object affordance
detection, dynamic changes and unpredictability. A critical challenge is the
agent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its
objectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for
reactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object
recognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as
optical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system
is grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic
knowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to
create queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer
entities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of
reasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for
normal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved
in particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to
autonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to
recognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible
by focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach
in a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects
involved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle
initially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it
learns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able
to plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation. This underscores
the agent's capability to expand its knowledge through observation in a
systematic way, and illustrates the potential of combining deep reasoning
[...].

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown
impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road
users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in
interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex
multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on
crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to
AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic
boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed
behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling
interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a
cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is
integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic
interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk
Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused
measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like
trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a
dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a
Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and
informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework
effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation
compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Physics-based simulations and learning-based models are vital for complex
robotics tasks like deformable object manipulation and liquid handling.
However, these models often struggle with accuracy due to epistemic uncertainty
or the sim-to-real gap. For instance, accurately pouring liquid from one
container to another poses challenges, particularly when models are trained on
limited demonstrations and may perform poorly in novel situations. This paper
proposes an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm designed
to mitigate these inaccuracies. By incorporating estimates of model
uncertainty, the proposed MCTS strategy biases the search towards actions with
lower predicted uncertainty. This approach enhances the reliability of planning
under uncertain conditions. Applied to a liquid pouring task, our method
demonstrates improved success rates even with models trained on minimal data,
outperforming traditional methods and showcasing its potential for robust
decision-making in robotics.

Abstract: To facilitate the wider adoption of robotics, accessible programming tools
are required for non-experts. Observational learning enables intuitive human
skills transfer through hands-on demonstrations, but relying solely on visual

especially when based on a single demonstration. This paper presents a
human-in-the-loop method for enhancing the robot execution plan, automatically
generated based on a single RGB video, with natural language input to a Large
Language Model (LLM). By including user-specified goals or critical task
aspects and exploiting the LLM common-sense reasoning, the system adjusts the
vision-based plan to prevent potential failures and adapts it based on the
received instructions. Experiments demonstrated the framework intuitiveness and
effectiveness in correcting vision-derived errors and adapting plans without
requiring additional demonstrations. Moreover, interactive plan refinement and

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架在干扰和约束冲突情况下仍能有效工作。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了干扰下的安全、稳定和鲁棒性问题，并通过分层设计解决了CBF与SMC的强耦合问题。

Abstract: Safety and stability are two critical concerns in pursuit-evasion (PE)
problems in an obstacle-rich environment. Most existing works combine control
barrier functions (CBFs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to provide an
efficient and safe solution. However, they do not consider the presence of
disturbances, such as wind gust and actuator fault, which may exist in many
practical applications. This paper integrates CBFs and a sliding mode control
(SMC) term into RL to simultaneously address safety, stability, and robustness
to disturbances. However, this integration is significantly challenging due to
the strong coupling between the CBF and SMC terms. Inspired by Stackelberg
game, we handle the coupling issue by proposing a hierarchical design scheme
where SMC and safe control terms interact with each other in a leader-follower
manner. Specifically, the CBF controller, acting as the leader, enforces safety
independently of the SMC design; while the SMC term, as the follower, is
designed based on the CBF controller. We then formulate the PE problem as a
zero-sum game and propose a safe robust RL framework to learn the min-max
strategy online. A sufficient condition is provided under which the proposed
algorithm remains effective even when constraints are conflicting. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safe robust RL framework.

Abstract: We tackle neural networks (NNs) to approximate model predictive control (MPC)
laws. We propose a novel learning-based explicit MPC structure, which is
reformulated into a dual-mode scheme over maximal constrained feasible set. The
scheme ensuring the learning-based explicit MPC reduces to linear feedback
control while entering the neighborhood of origin. We construct a safety
governor to ensure that learning-based explicit MPC satisfies all the state and

computationally easier to implement even in high-dimensional system. The proof
of recursive feasibility for the safety governor is given. Our approach is
demonstrated on numerical examples.

Conclusion: RL在G&CNETs训练中更具潜力，尤其是在复杂或随机环境中。

Abstract: Guidance & control networks (G&CNETs) provide a promising alternative to
on-board guidance and control (G&C) architectures for spacecraft, offering a
differentiable, end-to-end representation of the guidance and control
architecture. When training G&CNETs, two predominant paradigms emerge:
behavioural cloning (BC), which mimics optimal trajectories, and reinforcement
learning (RL), which learns optimal behaviour through trials and errors.
Although both approaches have been adopted in G&CNET related literature, direct
comparisons are notably absent. To address this, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of BC and RL specifically for training G&CNETs on continuous-thrust
spacecraft trajectory optimisation tasks. We introduce a novel RL training
framework tailored to G&CNETs, incorporating decoupled action and control
frequencies alongside reward redistribution strategies to stabilise training
and to provide a fair comparison. Our results show that BC-trained G&CNETs
excel at closely replicating expert policy behaviour, and thus the optimal
control structure of a deterministic environment, but can be negatively
constrained by the quality and coverage of the training dataset. In contrast
RL-trained G&CNETs, beyond demonstrating a superior adaptability to stochastic
conditions, can also discover solutions that improve upon suboptimal expert
demonstrations, sometimes revealing globally optimal strategies that eluded the
generation of training samples.

Abstract: This study proposes optimized Type-I and Type-II fuzzy controllers for
automotive suspension systems to enhance ride comfort and stability under road
disturbances (step/sine inputs), addressing the lack of systematic performance
comparisons in existing literature. We integrate Biogeography-Based
Optimization (BBO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithms

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation for traffic evacuation during railway
disruptions to enhance urban resilience. The research focuses on large-scale
railway networks and provides flexible simulation settings to accommodate
multiple node or line failures. The evacuation optimization model is
mathematically formulated using matrix computation and nonlinear programming.
The simulation integrates railway lines operated by various companies, along
with external geographical features of the network. Furthermore, to address
computational complexity in large-scale graph networks, a subgraph partitioning
solution is employed for computation acceleration. The model is evaluated using
the extensive railway network of Greater Tokyo. Data collection included both
railway network structure and real-world GPS footfall data to estimate the
number of station-area visitors for simulation input and evaluation purposes.
Several evacuation scenarios were simulated for major stations including Tokyo,
Shinjuku, Shibuya and so on. The results demonstrate that both evacuation
passenger flow (EPF) and average travel time (ATT) during emergencies were
successfully optimized, while remaining within the capacity constraints of
neighboring stations and the targeted disruption recovery times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 飞艇因其浮力升力和低速悬停能力适用于持久精确任务，但其大而轻的结构对环境扰动敏感，传统控制面在低速时失效，需开发新型控制策略。

Method: 采用E-INDI内环结合高层外环控制飞艇姿态和速度，利用倾斜螺旋桨等执行器，提出控制分配方法。

Result: 仿真测试表明，E-INDI控制器在激进机动、阵风抑制和参数失配下表现优异，鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: E-INDI控制器在飞艇全包线内实现高性能跟踪和鲁棒性，优于传统反演控制方法。

Abstract: Airships offer unique operational advantages due to their ability to generate
lift via buoyancy, enabling low-speed flight and stationary hovering. These
capabilities make them ideal for missions requiring endurance and precision
positioning. However, they also present significant control challenges: their
large, lightweight structures are highly sensitive to environmental
disturbances, and conventional aerodynamic control surfaces lose effectiveness
during low-speed or hover flight. The objective of this thesis is to develop a
robust control strategy tailored to a vectored-thrust airship equipped with
tiltable propellers. The proposed approach is based on an Extended Incremental
Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion inner loop in combination with a high level outer
loop, controlling the attitude and velocity of the airship. The proposed method
is able to effectively control the airship over the whole envelope, including
hover and high speed flight. For this, effective use of available actuators is
key. This includes especially the tilt rotors, for which a control allocation
method is presented. The controller's performance is validated through a series
of simulation-based test scenarios, including aggressive maneuvering, gust
rejection, atmospheric turbulence, and significant parameter mismatches. The
controller is compared against an alternative controller developed at the
institute, offering insight into the trade-offs between direct inversion and
incremental control approaches. Results demonstrate that the proposed E-INDI
controller achieves very good tracking performance and high high robustness
against parameter uncertainties.

Result: 证明了同步问题的可解性条件，并通过数值示例验证了设计方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过矩阵相位理论和控制器设计，实现了异构多智能体系统的高效同步，为复杂系统控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, scalable controller design to achieve output synchronization
for a heterogeneous discrete-time nonlinear multi-agent system is considered.
The agents are assumed to exhibit potentially nonlinear dynamics but share
linear common oscillatory modes. In a distributed control architecture,
scalability is ensured by designing a small number of distinguished
controllers, significantly fewer than the number of agents, even when agent
diversity is high. Our findings indicate that the number of controllers
required can be effectively determined by the number of strongly connected
components of the underlying graph. The study in this paper builds on the
recently developed phase theory of matrices and systems. First, we employ the
concept of matrix phase, specifically the phase alignability of a collection of
matrices, to quantify agent diversity. Next, we use matrix phase, particularly
the essential phase of the graph Laplacian, to evaluate the interaction quality
among the agents. Based on these insights, we derive a sufficient condition for
the solvability of the synchronization problem, framed as a trade-off between
the agent diversity and the interaction quality. In the process, a controller
design procedure based on Lyapunov analysis is provided, which produces low
gain, component-wise synchronizing controllers when the solvability condition
is satisfied. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of
the proposed design procedure. Furthermore, we consider cases where the
component-wise controller design problem is unsolvable. We propose alternative
strategies involving the design of a small inventory of controllers, which can
still achieve synchronization effectively by employing certain clustering
methods to manage heterogeneity.

Motivation: 解决系统最优交通分配中因部分驾驶员受益不均导致的自愿接受度低的问题。

Method: 提出Wardropian循环概念，设计精确计算方法和贪婪启发式算法，以减少循环长度和用户不便。

Result: 大规模模拟显示，该方法在巴塞罗那、柏林等城市显著减少交通不公平性，并在10天内消除大部分初始不公平。

Conclusion: Wardropian循环是一种有效且社会可接受的交通分配方法，能够同时满足公平性和最优性。

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralised
routing with full compliance, making System Optimal traffic assignment
attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than
others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose
a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian
visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to
satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as
sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and
equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers
(like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows
(like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and
reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As
identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we
introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution.
Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium,
which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral
deviations.
  We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In
Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles
with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in
Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly
reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7%
of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness
of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social
acceptability.

Result: 蒙特卡洛模拟显示，该方法显著降低了未对准误差，达到弧秒级精度。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限的航天器提供了一种计算可行且统计稳健的飞行中校准解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a novel adaptive framework for simultaneously estimating
spacecraft attitude and sensor misalignment. Uncorrected star tracker
misalignment can introduce significant pointing errors that compromise mission
objectives in GPS-denied environments. To address this challenge, the proposed
architecture integrates a Bayesian Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE)
framework operating over an N x N x N 3D hypothesis grid. Each hypothesis
employs a 9-state Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) to estimate
attitude, angular velocity, and gyroscope bias using TRIAD-based vector
measurements. A key contribution is the development of a robust grid refinement
strategy that uses hypothesis diversity and weighted-mean grid centering to
prevent the premature convergence commonly encountered in classical, dominant
model-based refinement triggers. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate
that the proposed method reduces the final misalignment RMSE relative to
classical approaches, achieving arcsecond-level accuracy. The resulting
framework offers a computationally tractable and statistically robust solution
for in-flight calibration, enhancing the navigational autonomy of
resource-constrained spacecraft.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell

time-invariant feedback systems. Connections between DW shells and various
graphical descriptions, as well as gain and phase measures, are established
through an intuitive geometric perspective. Within this framework, we examine
the relationships and relative conservatism among various separation
conditions. A rotated Scaled Relative Graph (SRG) concept is proposed as a
mixed gain-phase representation, from which a closed-loop stability criterion
is derived and shown to be the least conservative among the existing 2-D
graphical conditions for bi-component feedback loops. We also propose a
reliable algorithm for visualizing the rotated SRGs and include an example to
demonstrate the non-conservatism of the proposed condition.

Method: 使用CR3BP建模系统动力学，通过PAC方法计算轨道族成员，并用MPR模型拟合状态。开发NMPC框架生成最优参考轨迹，结合EKF观测器估计航天器状态。

Result: 数值模拟表明，与传统跟踪方法相比，燃料消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持航天器轨道的同时，优化了燃料使用，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme for
maintaining a spacecraft within a specified family of periodic orbits near the
libration points in cislunar space. Unlike traditional approaches that track a
predefined reference orbit, the proposed method designs an optimal trajectory
that keeps the spacecraft within the orbit family, regardless of the initial
reference. The Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) is used to model
the system dynamics. First, the Pseudo-Arclength Continuation (PAC) method is
employed to compute the members of each orbit family. Then, the state of each
member is parameterized by two variables: one defining the orbit and the other
specifying the location along it. These computed states are then fit to a
Multivariate Polynomial Regression (MPR) model. An NMPC framework is developed
to generate the optimal reference trajectory and compute the corresponding
velocity impulses for trajectory tracking. The control system is integrated
with a Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) observer that estimates the spacecraft's
relative state. Numerical simulations are conducted for Lyapunov, halo, and
near-rectilinear halo orbits near L1 and L2. The results demonstrate a
significant reduction in fuel consumption compared to conventional tracking
methods.

Conclusion: 新控制器在鲁棒性和性能上优于传统方法，适用于四旋翼无人机的有限时间位置控制。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel design for finite-time position control of
quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). A robust, finite-time, nonlinear
feedback controller is introduced to reject bounded disturbances in tracking
tasks. The proposed control framework differs conceptually from conventional
controllers that utilize Euler angle parameterization for attitude and adhere
to the traditional hierarchical inner-outer loop design. In standard
approaches, the translational controller and the corresponding desired attitude
are computed first, followed by the design of the attitude controller based on
time-scale separation between fast attitude and slow translational dynamics. In
contrast, the proposed control scheme is quaternion-based and utilizes a
transit feed-forward term in the attitude dynamics that anticipates the slower
translational subsystem. Robustness is achieved through the use of continuously
differentiable sliding manifolds. The proposed approach guarantees semi-global
finite-time stability, without requiring time-scale separation. Finally,
numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed controller.

Conclusion: 研究扩展了经典随机游走行为，揭示了非二次模板在特定系统中的必要性。

Abstract: Almost sure reachability refers to the property of a stochastic system
whereby, from any initial condition, the system state reaches a given target
set with probability one. In this paper, we study the problem of certifying
almost sure reachability in discrete-time stochastic systems using drift and
variant conditions. While these conditions are both necessary and sufficient in
theory, computational approaches often rely on restricting the search to fixed
templates, such as polynomial or quadratic functions. We show that this
restriction compromises completeness: there exists a polynomial system for
which a given target set is almost surely reachable but admits no polynomial
certificate, and a linear system for which a neighborhood of the origin is
almost surely reachable but admits no quadratic certificate. We then provide a
complete characterization of reachability certificates for linear systems with
additive noise. Our analysis yields conditions on the system matrices under
which valid certificates exist, and shows how the structure and dimension of
the system determine the need for non-quadratic templates. Our results
generalize the classical random walk behavior to a broader class of stochastic
dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 通过无限时域最优控制方法，成功解决了PLVM的模型规范问题，并提供了理论保证和实际验证。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the issue of model specification in probabilistic
latent variable models (PLVMs) using an infinite-horizon optimal control
approach. Traditional PLVMs rely on joint distributions to model complex data,
but introducing latent variables results in an ill-posed parameter learning
problem. To address this issue, regularization terms are typically introduced,
leading to the development of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm,
where the latent variable distribution is restricted to a predefined normalized
distribution family to facilitate the expectation step. To overcome this
limitation, we propose representing the latent variable distribution as a
finite set of instances perturbed via an ordinary differential equation with a
control policy. This approach ensures that the instances asymptotically
converge to the true latent variable distribution as time approaches infinity.
By doing so, we reformulate the distribution inference problem as an optimal
control policy determination problem, relaxing the model specification to an
infinite-horizon path space. Building on this formulation, we derive the
corresponding optimal control policy using the Pontryagin's maximum principle
and provide a closed-form expression for its implementation using the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space. After that, we develop a novel,
convergence-guaranteed EM algorithm for PLVMs based on this
infinite-horizon-optimal-control-based inference strategy. Finally, extensive
experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: ACCESS-AV在智能工厂中具有可持续性和成本效益。

Abstract: Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) are increasingly used for transporting
goods in 5G network-enabled smart factories, with the compute-intensive
localization module presenting a significant opportunity for optimization. We
propose ACCESS-AV, an energy-efficient Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
localization framework that leverages existing 5G infrastructure in smart
factory environments. By opportunistically accessing the periodically broadcast
5G Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs) for localization, ACCESS-AV obviates
the need for dedicated Roadside Units (RSUs) or additional onboard sensors to
achieve energy efficiency as well as cost reduction. We implement an
Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)-based estimation method using the Multiple Signal
Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, optimized for resource-constrained ADV
platforms through an adaptive communication-computation strategy that
dynamically balances energy consumption with localization accuracy based on
environmental conditions such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and vehicle
velocity. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCESS-AV achieves an average
energy reduction of 43.09% compared to non-adaptive systems employing AoA
algorithms such as vanilla MUSIC, ESPRIT, and Root-MUSIC. It maintains sub-30
cm localization accuracy while also delivering substantial reductions in
infrastructure and operational costs, establishing its viability for
sustainable smart factory environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based optimal control framework for
safety-critical systems with parametric uncertainties, addressing both
time-triggered and self-triggered controller implementations. First, we develop
a robust control barrier function (RCBF) incorporating Lyapunov-based
compensation terms to rigorously guarantee safety despite parametric
uncertainties. Building on this safety guarantee, we formulate the constrained
optimal control problem as the minimization of a novel safety-embedded value
function, where the RCBF is involved via a Lagrange multiplier that adaptively
balances safety constraints against optimal stabilization objectives. To
enhance computational efficiency, we propose a self-triggered implementation
mechanism that reduces control updates while maintaining dual stability-safety
guarantees. The resulting self-triggered constrained Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) equation is solved through an online safety-embedded critic learning
framework, with the Lagrange multiplier computed in real time to ensure safety.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in
achieving both safety and control performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的DeePO算法（PFDeePO），通过暂停控制增益更新和应用乘性噪声，解决了状态扰动问题，同时保持系统性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统DeePO算法需要添加探测噪声以确保持续激励，但噪声可能导致状态扰动。PFDeePO旨在消除这种扰动。

Method: PFDeePO在系统状态接近平衡点时暂停控制增益更新，并在控制器收敛时应用乘性噪声。

Result: 仿真表明，PFDeePO能有效消除状态扰动，同时保持系统性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: PFDeePO是一种无需探测噪声的改进算法，解决了状态扰动问题，适用于数据驱动的控制优化。

Abstract: This paper proposes modifications to the data-enabled policy optimization
(DeePO) algorithm to mitigate state perturbations. DeePO is an adaptive,
data-driven approach designed to iteratively compute a feedback gain equivalent
to the certainty-equivalence LQR gain. Like other data-driven approaches based
on Willems' fundamental lemma, DeePO requires persistently exciting input
signals. However, linear state-feedback gains from LQR designs cannot
inherently produce such inputs. To address this, probing noise is
conventionally added to the control signal to ensure persistent excitation.
However, the added noise may induce undesirable state perturbations. We first
identify two key issues that jeopardize the desired performance of DeePO when
probing noise is not added: the convergence of states to the equilibrium point,
and the convergence of the controller to its optimal value. To address these
challenges without relying on probing noise, we propose Perturbation-Free DeePO
(PFDeePO) built on two fundamental principles. First, the algorithm pauses the
control gain updating in DeePO process when system states are near the
equilibrium point. Second, it applies a multiplicative noise, scaled by a mean
value of $1$ as a gain for the control signal, when the controller converges.
This approach minimizes the impact of noise as the system approaches
equilibrium while preserving stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
PFDeePO through simulations, showcasing its ability to eliminate state
perturbations while maintaining system performance and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 住宅能源枢纽的多能源载体操作因动态差异、混合存储协调和高维动作空间而具有挑战性，需要有效的能源管理系统。

Method: 采用基于物理的电池退化和热系统模型，设计了两阶段经济模型预测控制器，并在荷兰顺序能源市场中验证其性能。

Result: 最佳控制策略是在第一阶段共同优化日前和日内拍卖，随后跟随日内拍卖。若日内价格未知，夏季跟随连续时间日内市场，冬季跟随日内拍卖。此外，顺序操作会增加电池退化。

Conclusion: 热储能提供的短期灵活性远低于静态电池组和双向充电电动汽车，控制器在优化能源市场操作中表现良好。

Abstract: The operation of residential energy hubs with multiple energy carriers
(electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to different
carrier dynamics, hybrid storage coordination and high-dimensional
action-spaces. Energy management systems oversee their operation, deciding the
set points of the primary control layer. This paper presents a novel 2-stage
economic model predictive controller for electrified buildings including
physics-based models of the battery degradation and thermal systems. The
hierarchical control operates in the Dutch sequential energy markets. In
particular common assumptions regarding intra-day markets (auction and
continuous-time) are discussed as well as the coupling of the different storage
systems. The best control policy is to co-optimize day-ahead and intra-day
auctions in the first stage, to later follow intra-day auctions. If no
intra-day prices are known at the time of the day-ahead auction, its best to
follow continuous time intra-day in the summer and the intra-day auction in the
winter. Additionally, this sequential operation increases battery degradation.
Finally, under our controller the realized short-term flexibility of the
thermal energy storage is marginal compared to the flexibility delivered by
static battery pack and electric vehicles with bidirectional charging.

Result: 在适当假设下，解（权重和激活）几乎必然收敛到平衡点。

Conclusion: 权重-激活动态的收敛性为神经网络理论提供了新视角，尤其在多稳定平衡点情况下。

Abstract: Convergence of dynamic feedback neural networks (NNs), as the
Cohen-Grossberg, Hopfield and cellular NNs, has been for a long time a
workhorse of NN theory. Indeed, convergence in the presence of multiple stable
equilibrium points (EPs) is crucial to implement content addressable memories
and solve several other signal processing tasks in real time. There are two
typical ways to use a convergent NN, i.e.: a) let the activations evolve while
maintaining fixed weights and inputs (activation dynamics) or b) adapt the
weights while maintaining fixed activations (weight dynamics). As remarked in a
seminal paper by Hirsch, there is another interesting possibility, i.e., let
the neuron interconnection weights evolve while simultaneously running the
activation dynamics (weight-activation dynamics). The weight-activation
dynamics is of importance also because it is more plausible than the other two
types for modeling neural systems. The paper breaks new ground by analyzing for
the first time in a systematic way the convergence properties of the
weight-activation dynamics for a class of memristor feedback dynamic NNs. The
main result is that, under suitable assumptions on the structure of the
memristor interconnections, the solutions (weights and activations) converge to
an EP, except at most for a set of initial conditions with zero measure. The
result includes the most important case where the NN has multiple stable EPs.

Conclusion: 一阶巴特沃斯滤波器是共射放大器输出信噪比优化的最佳选择。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the effects of the thermal noise of the base
resistance of common emitter amplifier (CEA) on the output SNR, and we show
that a first order Butterworth filter at the output of the CEA significantly
improves output SNR significantly and supress the performances of higher order
Butterworth, Chebyshev I, II and elliptic filters. We propose a formula for the
selection of cut-off frequency of analog filters for given orders to achieve
significant SNR improvement at CEA output. Considering the filter complexity
and output SNR improvement, we can conclude that the first order Butterworth
filter outperforms Chebyshev I, II and elliptic filters.

Conclusion: 清晰的概念分离有助于填补系统级与AI特有安全分析之间的差距，确保工程安全的AI系统。

Abstract: Assuring safety for ``AI-based'' systems is one of the current challenges in
safety engineering. For automated driving systems, in particular, further
assurance challenges result from the open context that the systems need to
operate in after deployment. The current standardization and regulation
landscape for ``AI-based'' systems is becoming ever more complex, as standards
and regulations are being released at high frequencies.
  This position paper seeks to provide guidance for making qualified arguments
which standards should meaningfully be applied to (``AI-based'') automated
driving systems. Furthermore, we argue for clearly differentiating sources of
risk between AI-specific and general uncertainties related to the open context.
In our view, a clear conceptual separation can help to exploit commonalities
that can close the gap between system-level and AI-specific safety analyses,
while ensuring the required rigor for engineering safe ``AI-based'' systems.

Result: 在3D圆柱绕流湍流模拟中，eAPG表现出高效性和准确性，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: eAPG方法在保持APG优点的同时，显著提高了计算效率，适用于复杂流体动力学问题。

Abstract: This research paper investigates the Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (APG) method for
reduced order models (ROM) and fluid dynamics governed by the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the
Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared
to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance
of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To
address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM
formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations.
The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test
basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison
to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to
augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and
accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization.
Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and
computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point
operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.

Conclusion: 该算法在复杂环境中提供了可靠的CAV定位解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is critical for the safe operation of
Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), especially in complex urban
environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are
unreliable. This paper presents a novel vision-based cooperative localization
algorithm that leverages onboard cameras and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication to enable CAVs to estimate their poses, even in occlusion-heavy
scenarios such as busy intersections. In particular, we propose a novel
decentralized observer for a group of connected agents that includes landmark
agents (static or moving) in the environment with known positions and vehicle
agents that need to estimate their poses (both positions and orientations).
Assuming that (i) there are at least three landmark agents in the environment,
(ii) each vehicle agent can measure its own angular and translational
velocities as well as relative bearings to at least three neighboring landmarks
or vehicles, and (iii) neighboring vehicles can communicate their pose
estimates, each vehicle can estimate its own pose using the proposed
decentralized observer. We prove that the origin of the estimation error is
locally exponentially stable under the proposed observer, provided that the
minimal observability conditions are satisfied. Moreover, we evaluate the
proposed approach through experiments with real 1/10th-scale connected vehicles
and large-scale simulations, demonstrating its scalability and validating the
theoretical guarantees in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Advancements in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology have enabled
higher sampling rates, making it feasible to adopt digital radar architectures
that directly sample the radio-frequency (RF) signal, eliminating the need for
analog downconversion. This digital approach supports greater flexibility in
waveform design and signal processing, particularly through digital modulation
schemes like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper
presents a digital radar system mounted on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV),
which employs OFDM waveforms for coherent multistatic synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) imaging in the L-band. The radar setup features a primary UAV node
responsible for signal transmission and monostatic data acquisition, alongside
secondary nodes that operate in a receive-only mode. These secondary nodes
capture the radar signal reflected from the scene as well as a direct sidelink
signal. RF signals from both the radar and sidelink paths are sampled and
processed offline. To manage data storage efficiently, a trigger mechanism is
employed to record only the relevant portions of the radar signal. The system
maintains coherency in both fast-time and slow-time domains, which is essential
for multistatic SAR imaging. Because the secondary nodes are passive, the
system can be easily scaled to accommodate a larger swarm of UAVs. The paper
details the full signal processing workflow for both monostatic and multistatic
SAR image formation, including an analysis and correction of synchronization
errors that arise from the uncoupled operation of the nodes. The proposed
coherent processing method is validated through static radar measurements,
demonstrating coherency achieved by the concept. Additionally, a UAV-based
bistatic SAR experiment demonstrates the system's performance by producing
high-resolution monostatic, bistatic, and combined multistatic SAR images.

Method: 在滚动时域框架中，结合零范数约束和阶段成本进行优化，利用交替最小化算法（MAMPC）求解，外步为二次规划，内步为解析解。

Result: 在两个案例（四罐系统和燃料电池堆）中验证，与标准MPC相比，实现了稀疏控制动作，但跟踪误差有所增加。

Conclusion: MAC在减少输入变化方面有效，但需权衡跟踪性能。

Abstract: Minimum Attention Control (MAC) is a control technique that provides minimal
input changes to meet the control objective. Mathematically, the zero norm of
the input changes is used as a constraint for the given control objective and
minimized with respect to the process dynamics. In this paper, along with the
zero norm constraint, stage costs are also considered for reference tracking in
a receding horizon framework. For this purpose, the optimal inputs of the
previous horizons are also considered in the optimization problem of the
current horizon. An alternating minimization algorithm is applied to solve the
optimization problem (Minimum Attention Model Predictive Control (MAMPC)). The
outer step of the optimization is a quadratic program, while the inner step,
which solves for sparsity, has an analytical solution. The proposed algorithm
is implemented on two case studies: a four-tank system with slow dynamics and a
fuel cell stack with fast dynamics. A detailed comparative study of the
proposed algorithm with standard MPC indicates sparse control actions with a
tradeoff in the tracking error.

Abstract: Series-parallel (SP) compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) systems are
widely used in some specific scenarios, such as bioelectronics and portable
electronics. However, most studies are based on the phasor method and focused
on the steady-state analysis, which may overlook the transient process of
systems. Accordingly, inspired by the notion of coordinate transformation in
the field of motor drive, this work develops a dq modeling method for SP
compensated WPT systems. The proposed model effectively characterizes
first-order system dynamics, facilitating enhanced measurement precision and
control system development. One measurement application, dq model-based mutual
inductance identification, is presented to reflect the value of the dq model.
Simulation results are shown to validate the model's effectiveness, indicating
that the developed model can be a good tool for the design of SP compensated
WPT systems.

With BTES, thermal energy is stored via a borehole heat exchanger in the

achieving a dynamic interaction between the building and BTES. However,
modeling BTES for MPC is challenging, and a trade-off between model accuracy

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in urban mobility modeling by focusing on
shift workers, a population segment comprising 15-20% of the workforce in
industrialized societies yet systematically underrepresented in traditional
transportation surveys and planning. This underrepresentation is revealed in
this study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark
differences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the
conventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we
introduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS
trajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for
individuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal
embeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to
capture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent
biases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the
generated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from
Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics). By
transforming incomplete GPS traces into complete, representative activity
patterns, our approach provides transportation planners with a powerful data
augmentation tool to fill critical gaps in understanding the 24/7 mobility
needs of urban populations, enabling precise and inclusive transportation
planning.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is vital for intelligent resource
management in 5G and beyond. However, conventional AI approaches often fail to
capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g.,
the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal
Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling
and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer
integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust
forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while
reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior
forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to
unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network
deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM,
with a 30% improvement in model generalization.

Conclusion: MADDPG框架能有效协调产消者决策，但价格操纵策略需警惕；市场规模的扩大有助于改善公平性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous
distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market
(LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme
utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling
prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from
any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading
in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy
using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN)
model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces
financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial
pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation
capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of
different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness
improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

Method: 在小波域中应用可学习的非线性变换（如软阈值和增益-相位调制），并引入可微分的小波基选择机制，支持多种小波族。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中（如SST-2情感分类），模型准确率为89.3%，接近4层Transformer（90.1%），但参数减少72%，内存消耗降低58%，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 光谱学习框架为视觉和语言任务提供了一种高效、可解释的替代方案，避免了过参数化架构，展示了其设计潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a fully spectral learning framework that eliminates traditional
neural layers by operating entirely in the wavelet domain. The model applies
learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase
modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable
wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families
such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.
  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral
pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising
and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment
classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer
Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters
and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to
spectral sparsity priors.
  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix
multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet
transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.
This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural
models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in
both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design
without overparameterized architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EENNs的设计依赖专家手动完成，复杂且耗时，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出NACHOS框架，结合NAS技术联合优化主干和EECs，生成满足约束的帕累托最优解。

Result: NACHOS设计的模型在精度和计算量上优于现有EENNs，并验证了两种新正则化项的有效性。

Conclusion: NACHOS为EENNs的自动化设计提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN)
with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate
points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved.
This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex
and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including
the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the
EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive
NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully
automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone
and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural
Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks
(NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying
constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC)
operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this
provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible
(i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best
tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the
models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs.
Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel
regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers
of the EENN

Motivation: 甲型流感每年导致大量死亡，改进预测模型有助于公共卫生规划和干预。

Method: 使用2009年至2023年历史数据，比较ARIMA、ETS与六种深度学习模型（如RNN、LSTM、Transformer等）的性能。

Result: 所有深度学习模型均优于传统方法，Transformer表现最佳（测试MSE和MAE分别为0.0433和0.1126）。

Conclusion: 深度学习可提升传染病预测能力，未来需研究如何将其整合到实时预测和监测系统中。

Abstract: Influenza A is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year,
though this estimate is an improvement from years past due to improvements in
sanitation, healthcare practices, and vaccination programs. In this study, we
perform a comparative analysis of traditional and deep learning models to
predict Influenza A outbreaks. Using historical data from January 2009 to
December 2023, we compared the performance of traditional ARIMA and Exponential
Smoothing(ETS) models with six distinct deep learning architectures: Simple
RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer. The results reveal a clear
superiority of all the deep learning models, especially the state-of-the-art
Transformer with respective average testing MSE and MAE of 0.0433 \pm 0.0020
and 0.1126 \pm 0.0016 for capturing the temporal complexities associated with
Influenza A data, outperforming well known traditional baseline ARIMA and ETS
models. These findings of this study provide evidence that state-of-the-art
deep learning architectures can enhance predictive modeling for infectious
diseases and indicate a more general trend toward using deep learning methods
to enhance public health forecasting and intervention planning strategies.
Future work should focus on how these models can be incorporated into real-time
forecasting and preparedness systems at an epidemic level, and integrated into
existing surveillance systems.

Abstract: Stock trading has always been a challenging task due to the highly volatile
nature of the stock market. Making sound trading decisions to generate profit
is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose
four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks.
These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect
to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial
neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the
high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series
models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading
strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different
S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning
techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022
and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best
loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and
48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of
around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的UGC容易受到煽动和操纵，需要有效监管。自动化内容审核虽能过滤违规内容，但会引发用户的策略性回应，需平衡言论自由与社会扭曲。

Method: 通过机制设计优化言论自由与社会扭曲的权衡，提出近似最优解的实用方法，并提供有限离线数据量的泛化保证。

Result: 尽管最优权衡问题是NP难的，但提出了近似最优解的实用方法，并确定了所需离线数据量。

Conclusion: 研究为社交媒体内容审核提供了平衡言论自由与社会扭曲的可行方法，并量化了数据需求。

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms is vulnerable to
incitements and manipulations, necessitating effective regulations. To address
these challenges, those platforms often deploy automated content moderators
tasked with evaluating the harmfulness of UGC and filtering out content that
violates established guidelines. However, such moderation inevitably gives rise
to strategic responses from users, who strive to express themselves within the
confines of guidelines. Such phenomena call for a careful balance between: 1.
ensuring freedom of speech -- by minimizing the restriction of expression; and
2. reducing social distortion -- measured by the total amount of content
manipulation. We tackle the problem of optimizing this balance through the lens
of mechanism design, aiming at optimizing the trade-off between minimizing
social distortion and maximizing free speech. Although determining the optimal
trade-off is NP-hard, we propose practical methods to approximate the optimal
solution. Additionally, we provide generalization guarantees determining the
amount of finite offline data required to approximate the optimal moderator
effectively.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycle volume estimation is essential for informed urban
and transport planning but it is challenged by extremely sparse count data in
urban bicycling networks worldwide. We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task
framework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing
sparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model
intricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates
synthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the
estimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for
bicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level
categorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using
OpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of
Melbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts
(resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN
outperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99.
Ablation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE
components. Our research advances bicycling volume estimation in sparse
networks using novel and state-of-the-art approaches, providing insights for
sustainable bicycling infrastructures.

Abstract: Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation
(EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations
in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node
matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for
large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential
solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently
capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices,
which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose
an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit.
Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to
accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to
directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures
global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to
all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and
target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for
subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN采用固定聚合函数（如Mean、Max、Sum）缺乏理论依据，尤其在异质性图中表现不佳，且现有改进方法依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 提出AMLP框架，通过图重构方法实现高阶分组效应，并使用单层网络编码异质性，使MLP适应聚合操作。

Result: 在节点聚类和分类任务中表现出优越性能，适用于多样化的图学习场景。

Conclusion: AMLP是一种轻量级且高效的无监督方法，能够提升GNN在异质性图中的表现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning
graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms.
However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or
Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity,
especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem
dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more
sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on
labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we
propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer
Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting
aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight
approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction
method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a
single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby
improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on
node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of
AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.

Motivation: 结构健康监测（SHM）的训练数据昂贵且难以获取，尤其是标注数据。不同结构间的分布差异限制了传统机器学习方法的泛化能力。

Method: 利用转移学习（TL）和模态保证准则（MAC）选择相似特征，量化健康结构模态的对应关系，以识别条件分布不变的跨域特征。

Result: MAC与衡量联合分布相似性的监督指标高度一致，验证了其在选择跨域一致性特征上的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过数值和实验案例研究，证明了该方法在不同应用中的有效性，为SHM系统提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are
expensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data.
Population-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering
the available data across a population of structures. However, differences
between structures will mean the training and testing distributions will
differ; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to
generalise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),
can be used to leverage information across related domains. An important
consideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based
metrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.
Thus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is
to identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for
which the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.
Generally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain
expertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on
the dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,
knowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal
assurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the
modes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with
a supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the
primary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The
MAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave
consistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with
invariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on
numerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various
applications.

Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers
discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive
time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only
5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning
(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,
capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its
accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by
large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex
algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in
this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known
ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models
that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict
is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show
promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset
imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further
ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes
that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques
significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for
each model.

Conclusion: PINN通过结合先验知识，显著提升了神经网络在稀疏数据下的泛化能力，为复杂问题的求解提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Mathematical models in neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex
differential equations and optimizing their parameters; that is, solving the
forward and inverse problems, respectively. A forward problem predicts the
output of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An
inverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively
model the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both
problems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the
cost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.
This also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without
overfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The
prior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.
Residuals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of
corresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to
effectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior
knowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss
function and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the
model parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and
inverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with
residuals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and
then expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex
differential equations. We will mainly use Python as the computing language,
using the PyTorch library to aid us in our research.

Abstract: We consider controllable DNA sequence design, where sequences are generated
by conditioning on specific biological properties. While language models (LMs)
such as GPT and BERT have achieved remarkable success in natural language
generation, their application to DNA sequence generation remains largely
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ATGC-Gen, an Automated Transformer
Generator for Controllable Generation, which leverages cross-modal encoding to
integrate diverse biological signals. ATGC-Gen is instantiated with both
decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures, allowing flexible
training and generation under either autoregressive or masked recovery
objectives. We evaluate ATGC-Gen on representative tasks including promoter and
enhancer sequence design, and further introduce a new dataset based on ChIP-Seq
experiments for modeling protein binding specificity. Our experiments
demonstrate that ATGC-Gen can generate fluent, diverse, and biologically
relevant sequences aligned with the desired properties. Compared to prior
methods, our model achieves notable improvements in controllability and
functional relevance, highlighting the potential of language models in
advancing programmable genomic design. The source code is released at

advancements. From a topological point of view, these architecture may be
represented as graphs in which we learn the functions related to the nodes
while fixed edges convey the information from the input to the output. A recent
work introduced a new architecture called Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) that
reports how putting learnable activation functions on the edges of the neural
network leads to better performances in multiple scenarios. Multiple studies
are focusing on optimizing the KAN architecture by adding important features
such as dropout regularization, Autoencoders (AE), model benchmarking and last,
but not least, the KAN Convolutional Network (KCN) that introduced matrix
convolution with KANs learning. This study aims to benchmark multiple versions
of vanilla AEs (such as Linear, Convolutional and Variational) against their
Kolmogorov-Arnold counterparts that have same or less number of parameters.
Using cardiological signals as model input, a total of five different classic
AE tasks were studied: reconstruction, generation, denoising, inpainting and
anomaly detection. The proposed experiments uses a medical dataset

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for
modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large
language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their
capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant
challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats,
requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph
verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover,
these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective
transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose
STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph
structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike
traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL
divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data,
which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both
LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot
transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple
node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different
LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球绿色氢能投资增长，但缺乏沙漠环境下大规模氢设施的历史维护数据，导致风险评估困难。

Method: 开发基于公开气象数据的AI决策支持系统，生成维护压力指数（MPI），预测氢能基础设施的维护需求和风险水平。

Result: MPI工具能够填补历史数据空白，为基础设施规划和拍卖决策提供时间维度的风险评估。

Conclusion: 该AI系统可增强监管前瞻性和运营决策，支持绿色氢能项目的可持续发展。

Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation,
Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and
international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project
rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While
this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to
environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite
growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,
with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence
production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This
absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale
hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for
accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.
Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and
reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because
harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity
fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable
energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial
Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available
meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),
which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen
infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational
decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate
performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk
intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical
operational benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重症监护病房（ICU）中，血压监测至关重要，但现有方法存在外部验证不足、缺乏不确定性量化及数据泄漏预防等问题。

Method: 采用系统化的数据泄漏预防、分位数回归进行不确定性量化，并在MIMIC-III和eICU数据库间进行外部验证。结合梯度提升、随机森林和XGBoost的集成框架，使用74个生理特征。

Result: 内部验证表现良好（SBP: R²=0.86, RMSE=6.03 mmHg; DBP: R²=0.49, RMSE=7.13 mmHg），外部验证性能下降30%。不确定性量化生成了有效的预测区间。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨机构AI辅助血压监测提供了实际部署的预期，并公开了源代码。

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is critical in in tensive care units (ICUs)
where hemodynamic instability can
  rapidly progress to cardiovascular collapse. Current machine
  learning (ML) approaches suffer from three limitations: lack of
  external validation, absence of uncertainty quantification, and
  inadequate data leakage prevention. This study presents the
  first comprehensive framework with novel algorithmic leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional
  validation for electronic health records (EHRs) based BP pre dictions. Our
methodology implemented systematic data leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification through quantile regres sion, and
external validation between the MIMIC-III and eICU
  databases. An ensemble framework combines Gradient Boosting,
  Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features across five
  physiological domains. Internal validation achieved a clinically
  acceptable performance (for SBP: R^2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.03
  mmHg; DBP: R^2 = 0.49, RMSE = 7.13 mmHg), meeting AAMI
  standards. External validation showed 30% degradation with
  critical limitations in patients with hypotensive. Uncertainty
  quantification generated valid prediction intervals (80.3% SBP
  and 79.9% DBP coverage), enabling risk-stratified protocols
  with narrow intervals (< 15 mmHg) for standard monitoring
  and wide intervals (> 30 mmHg) for manual verification. This
  framework provides realistic deployment expectations for cross institutional
AI-assisted BP monitoring in critical care settings.

Method: 引入动态提示生成网络，生成上下文感知提示，结合联邦学习优化模型。

Result: 在三个NLP基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，显著减少计算时间和参数传输量。

Conclusion: FedDPG在保持隐私的同时，提升了模型性能和效率。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging
PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead.
Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

Result: 通过多语言维基百科嵌入评估自然语言在材料设计中的潜力，提出了一种新的材料发现范式。

Conclusion: 该研究为人工智能在非晶材料及其他领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research
fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for
metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations
of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only
several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960.
Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques
provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data
scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is
usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model
predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data
learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded
from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile
architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden
relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different
languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.
Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and
beyond with artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 扩展SwiftTD算法以解决控制问题，特别是在需要区分相关信号和噪声信号的环境中。

Method: 结合SwiftTD和True Online Sarsa(λ)开发Swift-Sarsa算法，并在操作条件基准测试中验证其性能。

Result: Swift-Sarsa能够有效区分相关信号和噪声信号，无需先验知识，且性能不受噪声特征影响。

Conclusion: Swift-Sarsa为并行搜索大量特征的学习方法提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) introduced a new algorithm for TD
learning -- SwiftTD -- that augments True Online TD($\lambda$) with step-size
optimization, a bound on the effective learning rate, and step-size decay. In
their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\lambda$) and
TD($\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and
its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended
abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key
ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the
$\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant
conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are
relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled
from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn
to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and
minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters
associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to
assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the
structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn
representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel
without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

Motivation: 当前消融疗法对持续性AF效果不佳，因非肺静脉驱动源的参与。研究旨在通过无监督学习自动分析EGMs，识别AF驱动源。

Method: 使用卷积自编码器从EGMs中提取潜在特征，保留形态学特征，并通过下游分类器检测旋转和焦点活动。

Result: 模型在检测旋转和焦点活动时表现中等（AUC 0.73-0.76），但在识别心房EGM纠缠时表现优异（AUC 0.93）。

Conclusion: 该方法可实时运行并集成到临床电解剖标测系统中，展示了无监督学习在揭示心内信号生理学特征方面的潜力。

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia, yet
current ablation therapies, including pulmonary vein isolation, are frequently
ineffective in persistent AF due to the involvement of non-pulmonary vein
drivers. This study proposes a deep learning framework using convolutional
autoencoders for unsupervised feature extraction from unipolar and bipolar
intracavitary electrograms (EGMs) recorded during AF in ablation studies. These
latent representations of atrial electrical activity enable the
characterization and automation of EGM analysis, facilitating the detection of
AF drivers.
  The database consisted of 11,404 acquisitions recorded from 291 patients,
containing 228,080 unipolar EGMs and 171,060 bipolar EGMs. The autoencoders
successfully learned latent representations with low reconstruction loss,
preserving the morphological features. The extracted embeddings allowed
downstream classifiers to detect rotational and focal activity with moderate
performance (AUC 0.73-0.76) and achieved high discriminative performance in
identifying atrial EGM entanglement (AUC 0.93).
  The proposed method can operate in real-time and enables integration into
clinical electroanatomical mapping systems to assist in identifying
arrhythmogenic regions during ablation procedures. This work highlights the
potential of unsupervised learning to uncover physiologically meaningful
features from intracardiac signals.

Result: BEASTAL能完成任何线性任务，在局部规则非线性时表现最佳。

Conclusion: BEASTAL通过简单局部规则实现高效学习，无需复杂架构或大内存。

Abstract: Machine Learning, however popular and accessible, is computationally
intensive and highly power-consuming, prompting interest in alternative
physical implementations of learning tasks. We introduce a training scheme for
physical systems that minimize power dissipation in which only boundary
parameters (i.e. inputs and outputs) are externally controlled. Using this
scheme, these Boundary-Enabled Adaptive State Tuning Systems (BEASTS) learn by
exploiting local physical rules. Our scheme, BEASTAL (BEAST-Adaline), is the
closest analog of the Adaline algorithm for such systems. We demonstrate this
autonomous learning in silico for regression and classification tasks. Our
approach advances previous physical learning schemes by using intuitive, local
evolution rules without requiring large-scale memory or complex internal
architectures. BEASTAL can perform any linear task, achieving best performance
when the local evolution rule is non-linear.

Conclusion: 该算法高效且可扩展，适用于计算Wasserstein重心。

Abstract: We propose an efficient federated dual decomposition algorithm for
calculating the Wasserstein barycenter of several distributions, including
choosing the support of the solution. The algorithm does not access local data
and uses only highly aggregated information. It also does not require repeated
solutions to mass transportation problems. Because of the absence of any
matrix-vector operations, the algorithm exhibits a very low complexity of each
iteration and significant scalability. We illustrate its virtues and compare it
to the state-of-the-art methods on several examples of mixture models.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of
applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits
of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static
inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these
agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal
data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector
DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,
we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for
dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and
across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers
several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI
execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and
bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and
compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular
operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic
orchestration system that can place the granular components across a
heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an
end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and
preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can
deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for
some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer
accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU
infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed
infrastructure.

Motivation: 研究神经网络为何在某些任务（如阶梯函数）上显著优于核方法，并探讨现有特征学习理论的局限性。

Method: 引入特征质量概念，分析现有特征学习理论，并通过实证研究验证其局限性。

Result: 现有理论主要衡量特征学习的强度，而非特征质量，无法为神经网络泛化理论提供充分基础。

Conclusion: 需要发展新的理论框架，以更好地理解特征质量及其对神经网络泛化的影响。

Abstract: Neural networks outperform kernel methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude,
e.g. on staircase functions. This advantage stems from the ability of neural
networks to learn features, adapting their hidden representations to better
capture the data. We introduce a concept we call feature quality to measure
this performance improvement. We examine existing theories of feature learning
and demonstrate empirically that they primarily assess the strength of feature
learning, rather than the quality of the learned features themselves.
Consequently, current theories of feature learning do not provide a sufficient
foundation for developing theories of neural network generalization.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

Method: 通过滑动窗口将CAN流量表示为图，使用多层GAT作为教师模型，训练轻量学生模型（仅教师模型的6.32%），结合监督预训练和知识蒸馏。

Result: 在Car-Hacking和Car-Survival数据集上，学生模型分别达到99.97%和99.31%的准确率，但在can-train-and-test数据集上因类别不平衡性能下降。

Conclusion: KD-GAT在检测精度和计算复杂度上表现优异，但需进一步解决类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely adopted for in-vehicle
communication but lacks inherent security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to
cyberattacks. This paper introduces KD-GAT, an intrusion detection framework
that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with knowledge distillation (KD)
to enhance detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity. In our
approach, CAN traffic is represented as graphs using a sliding window to
capture temporal and relational patterns. A multi-layer GAT with jumping
knowledge aggregation acting as the teacher model, while a compact student
GAT--only 6.32% the size of the teacher--is trained via a two-phase process
involving supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation with both soft and
hard label supervision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test demonstrate that both teacher and student
models achieve strong results, with the student model attaining 99.97% and
99.31% accuracy on Car-Hacking and Car-Survival, respectively. However,
significant class imbalance in can-train-and-test has led to reduced
performance for both models on this dataset. Addressing this imbalance remains
an important direction for future work.

Conclusion: 商业语义对共访模式预测至关重要，新方法在性能和可扩展性上均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Understanding where people go after visiting one business is crucial for
urban planning, retail analytics, and location-based services. However,
predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains
challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between
spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only
geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer
flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce
NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business
taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale
co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured
through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial
models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion
potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while
combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end
framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million
co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the
R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with
strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).

Abstract: We propose a new framework for generating cross-sectional synthetic datasets
via disjoint generative models. In this paradigm, a dataset is partitioned into
disjoint subsets that are supplied to separate instances of generative models.
The results are then combined post hoc by a joining operation that works in the
absence of common variables/identifiers. The success of the framework is
demonstrated through several case studies and examples on tabular data that
helps illuminate some of the design choices that one may make. The principal
benefit of disjoint generative models is significantly increased privacy at
only a low utility cost. Additional findings include increased effectiveness
and feasibility for certain model types and the possibility for mixed-model
synthesis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的向量检索范式——语义压缩，通过子模优化和信息几何原理，选择具有代表性和多样性的向量集，以提升语义覆盖和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近似最近邻（ANN）搜索在检索时往往产生语义冗余的结果，缺乏多样性和上下文丰富性，无法满足如检索增强生成（RAG）等应用的需求。

Method: 提出基于语义压缩的检索方法，结合子模优化和信息几何，并引入图增强向量检索，通过语义图（如kNN或知识图谱）实现多跳和上下文感知搜索。

Result: 理论分析了高维集中性下基于邻近检索的局限性，展示了图结构如何提升语义覆盖，为语义中心向量搜索系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 论文为向量搜索系统提供了新的方向，强调混合索引、多样性感知查询和结构化语义检索，并公开了实现以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Vector databases typically rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
to retrieve the top-k closest vectors to a query in embedding space. While
effective, this approach often yields semantically redundant results, missing
the diversity and contextual richness required by applications such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-hop QA, and memory-augmented
agents. We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims
to select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader
semantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles
from submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it
generalizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity.
To operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which
overlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector
spaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the
limitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration
and highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage. Our work
outlines a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, emphasizing
hybrid indexing, diversity-aware querying, and structured semantic retrieval.
We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this
area.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DisasterMobLLM的框架，用于预测灾害场景下的人类移动性，通过结合LLM和RAG技术，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市化与气候变化加剧了城市对自然灾害的脆弱性，现有移动性预测模型在灾害场景下表现不佳，需要一种适应灾害场景的新方法。

Method: DisasterMobLLM结合LLM和RAG技术，通过意图预测、意图优化和位置预测三步骤实现灾害场景下的移动性预测。

Result: 实验表明，DisasterMobLLM在Acc@1和F1-score上分别提升了32.8%和35.0%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DisasterMobLLM为灾害场景下的移动性预测提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cities to natural disasters has increased with
urbanization and climate change, making it more important to predict human
mobility in the disaster scenarios for downstream tasks including
location-based early disaster warning and pre-allocating rescue resources, etc.
However, existing human mobility prediction models are mainly designed for
normal scenarios, and fail to adapt to disaster scenarios due to the shift of
human mobility patterns under disaster. To address this issue, we introduce
\textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios
that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by
leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common
knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities.
This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next
intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the
intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor.
Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\%
improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score
of predicting immobility compared to the baselines. The code is available at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DisasterMobLLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 酶的热稳定性对工业和科研应用至关重要，但实验测定成本高且耗时，现有计算方法受限于数据不足和不平衡分布。

Method: 构建了一个温度稳定性数据集，并开发了Segment Transformer模型，利用蛋白质序列的片段级表示进行预测。

Result: 模型在RMSE、MAE和相关性指标上表现优异，实验验证显示通过17个突变显著提高了酶的相对活性。

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

Conclusion: 该方法简化了设计表达流程，提高了结构图纸生成的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings
serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and
builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a
reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized
using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation
view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized
symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite
advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing
remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we
introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings
employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts
to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is
capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these
to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired
structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and
evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural
drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly
reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with
manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of
engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CWMI的新框架，通过嵌入因果物理模型提升LLM的物理推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs缺乏对物理动态的直观理解，限制了其在需要因果推理的实际场景中的应用。

Method: 引入了Causal Physics Module (CPM)和Causal Intervention Loss训练目标，从多模态数据中学习因果关系。

Result: CWMI在零样本物理推理任务（如PIQA和PhysiCa-Bench）上显著优于现有LLMs。

Conclusion: 诱导因果世界模型是实现更可靠、泛化性更强的AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities,
fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which
limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal
reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a
novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an
LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a
new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model
to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the
model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely
capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal
representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning
tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench
dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a
critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

Abstract: Bladder cancer claims one life every 3 minutes worldwide. Most patients are
diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), yet up to 70% recur
after treatment, triggering a relentless cycle of surgeries, monitoring, and
risk of progression. Clinical tools like the EORTC risk tables are outdated and
unreliable - especially for intermediate-risk cases.
  We propose an interpretable AI model using the Tsetlin Machine (TM), a
symbolic learner that outputs transparent, human-readable logic. Tested on the
PHOTO trial dataset (n=330), TM achieved an F1-score of 0.80, outperforming
XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42). TM reveals the

Motivation: 探究联邦学习在医学影像中因本地配置（如优化器和学习率）导致的性能不稳定问题。

Method: 通过结肠病理和血细胞分类任务，对多种FL方法进行基准测试，分析本地配置的影响。

Result: 本地优化器和学习率的选择比FL方法本身对性能影响更大；本地训练轮数对收敛效果有正负影响。

Conclusion: 在联邦学习中，合适的本地配置比算法复杂性更重要。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables
decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise
in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such
as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical
deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge
device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology
and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of
local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the
specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can
either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These
findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial
than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在持续学习时会出现灾难性遗忘和嵌入对齐退化，影响其零样本能力。

Method: 使用梯度零空间投影（GNSP）避免干扰先前任务，结合知识蒸馏和模态对齐损失保持嵌入空间稳定性。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中取得SOTA性能，保持CLIP的模态间隙和跨模态检索能力。

Conclusion: GNSP方法有效解决了持续学习中的问题，保持了CLIP的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

Abstract: Resolution of incidents or problem tickets is a common theme in service
industries in any sector, including billing and charging systems in telecom
domain. Machine learning can help to identify patterns and suggest resolutions
for the problem tickets, based on patterns in the historical data of the
tickets. However, this process may be complicated due to a variety of phenomena
such as data drift and issues such as missing data, lack of data pertaining to
resolutions of past incidents, too many similar sounding resolutions due to
free text and similar sounding text. This paper proposes a robust ML-driven
solution employing clustering, supervised learning, and advanced NLP models to
tackle these challenges effectively. Building on previous work, we demonstrate
clustering-based resolution identification, supervised classification with LDA,
Siamese networks, and One-shot learning, Index embedding. Additionally, we
present a real-time dashboard and a highly available Kubernetes-based
production deployment. Our experiments with both the open-source Bitext

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Abstract: Landmine removal is a slow, resource-intensive process affecting over 60
countries. While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)
detection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited
attention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.
This work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to
predict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time
efficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for
pattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first
AI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the
accuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.
We particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,
respectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear
pattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component
analysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern
deminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the
Bayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a
Bayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,
RestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing
pattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the
average share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time
than the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear
and curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,
suggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk
prediction.

Result: CLoRA性能与基线方法相当甚至更优，同时显著降低了硬件需求。

Conclusion: CLoRA适用于资源受限环境，为持续学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, associated privacy concerns
have attracted growing attention. To address this, researchers have begun
adapting machine unlearning techniques from traditional classification models
to generative settings. Although notable progress has been made in this area, a
unified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work
is still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of
unlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair
comparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of
generative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic
characteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this
gap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose
a unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,
methodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the
connections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,
reinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We
further highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in
real-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future
research directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements
in this field. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at

Conclusion: 研究揭示了联邦图学习中客户端身份泄露的新隐私威胁，呼吁设计抗归属推理的GNN模型。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including
social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data
due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly
deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and
privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph
structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first
systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against
node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client
aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior
centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in
training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained
privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework
that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding
proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We
evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.
Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership
inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy
threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural
and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一阶优化方法（如SGD和Adam）在复杂损失曲面中表现不佳，而二阶方法计算成本过高。Dimer方法通过梯度信息估计曲率，为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: DEO基于Dimer方法，通过构造两个邻近点估计局部曲率，并周期性地将梯度投影到最小曲率方向的正交子空间，避免陷入鞍点和平坦区域。

Result: 在Transformer玩具模型上的初步实验表明，DEO在复杂损失曲面中的表现优于标准一阶方法。

Conclusion: DEO通过物理启发的曲率估计技术，为高维空间中的神经网络训练提供了高效的一阶优化方案。

Abstract: First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for
training large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency
and robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these
methods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,
plateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature
information from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are
computationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order
technique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry
of a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only
gradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for
locating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel
framework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the
Dimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating
the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By
periodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the
minimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points
and flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.
Preliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves
competitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving
navigation of complex loss landscapes. Our work repurposes physics-inspired,
first-order curvature estimation to enhance neural network training in
high-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: Precise fare prediction is crucial in ride-hailing platforms and urban
mobility systems. This study examines three machine learning models-Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), XGBoost, and TimesNet to evaluate their predictive
capabilities for taxi fares using a real-world dataset comprising over 55

TL;DR: Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) 是一种基于流的强化学习算法，将流匹配引入策略梯度框架，无需精确似然计算，适用于连续控制任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将流模型的生成能力与强化学习结合，解决传统高斯策略在多模态动作分布和欠条件设置中的性能限制。

Method: FPO 通过优势加权比最大化流匹配损失，兼容 PPO-clip 框架，训练时不依赖特定采样方法。

Result: FPO 在连续控制任务中表现优异，流模型能捕捉多模态动作分布，性能优于高斯策略。

Conclusion: FPO 提供了一种灵活且高效的流模型强化学习方法，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling
continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce
Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO
casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed
from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the
popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood
computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.
Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind
training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of
diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that
FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous
control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action
distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,
particularly in under-conditioned settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新算法FedSWA和FedMoSWA，旨在解决FedSAM在数据高度异构时泛化能力不足的问题，并通过理论和实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究联邦学习中数据异构性对泛化能力的影响，发现FedSAM在高度异构数据下表现不佳，因此提出改进算法。

Method: 提出FedSWA（基于随机权重平均）和FedMoSWA（基于动量的随机控制权重平均），以寻找更平坦的最小值并优化局部与全局模型对齐。

Result: 理论分析表明FedMoSWA的优化和泛化误差更小；实验在CIFAR10/100和Tiny ImageNet上验证了算法的优越性。

Conclusion: FedSWA和FedMoSWA在高度异构数据下表现优于FedSAM及其变体，为联邦学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: For federated learning (FL) algorithms such as FedSAM, their generalization
capability is crucial for real-word applications. In this paper, we revisit the
generalization problem in FL and investigate the impact of data heterogeneity
on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in
the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective
federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called
\texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly
heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic
controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed
to better align local and global models.
  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds
for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization
and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their
counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental
results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts. Open source code at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Irredundant k-fold交叉验证方法，确保每个实例仅用于一次训练和一次测试，减少冗余和过拟合，同时保持分层和模型无关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-fold交叉验证中，实例重复使用导致冗余和不平衡，影响学习效果和模型比较。

Method: 引入Irredundant k-fold交叉验证，确保每个实例仅用于一次训练和一次测试，保持分层和模型无关性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与传统k-fold相当，但方差估计更准确，计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Irredundant k-fold交叉验证是一种更高效、更平衡的验证方法，适用于多种数据集和模型。

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times
for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many
instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce
Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each
instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the
entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization
of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables
sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves
stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any
classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent
performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold
cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because
training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall
computational cost.

Conclusion: $K^4$在性能、速度和实用性上均优于现有方法，为日志异常检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on
error-prone parsing, and use unrealistic evaluation protocols. We introduce
$K^4$, an unsupervised and parser-independent framework for high-performance
online detection. $K^4$ transforms arbitrary log embeddings into compact
four-dimensional descriptors (Precision, Recall, Density, Coverage) using
efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) statistics. These descriptors enable
lightweight detectors to accurately score anomalies without retraining. Using a
more realistic online evaluation protocol, $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art
(AUROC: 0.995-0.999), outperforming baselines by large margins while being
orders of magnitude faster, with training under 4 seconds and inference as low

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中，神经网络容易因早期数据偏见（primacy bias）而难以适应后续任务，而特征学习动态（如grokking现象）可能为解决这一问题提供线索。

Method: 提出通过增加有效学习率（参数与更新范数的比值）来诱导特征学习动态，从而克服早期偏见。

Result: 该方法在grokking、神经网络热启动和强化学习等多种任务中促进了特征学习并提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过调控特征学习动态，可以有效解决持续学习中的早期数据偏见问题，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: In continual learning problems, it is often necessary to overwrite components
of a neural network's learned representation in response to changes in the data
stream; however, neural networks often exhibit \primacy bias, whereby early
training data hinders the network's ability to generalize on later tasks. While
feature-learning dynamics of nonstationary learning problems are not well
studied, the emergence of feature-learning dynamics is known to drive the
phenomenon of grokking, wherein neural networks initially memorize their
training data and only later exhibit perfect generalization. This work
conjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate
generalization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous
learned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating
feature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias
in non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method
to induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing
the effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.
We show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves
generalization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting
neural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.

Motivation: 保护联邦学习中的模型隐私，防止窃听者获取敏感信息。

Method: 将模型学习视为参数估计问题，推导位移更新的Fisher信息矩阵并使其奇异化，同时安全共享位移以保持模型准确性。

Result: 方案在数值实验中表现出更高的模型位移，同时需要更少的带宽秘密通道。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护隐私且不影响模型准确性，通过收敛测试验证了其安全性。

Abstract: In this paper, shifts are introduced to preserve model privacy against an
eavesdropper in federated learning. Model learning is treated as a parameter
estimation problem. This perspective allows us to derive the Fisher Information
matrix of the model updates from the shifted updates and drive them to
singularity, thus posing a hard estimation problem for Eve. The shifts are
securely shared with the central server to maintain model accuracy at the
server and participating devices. A convergence test is proposed to detect if
model updates have been tampered with and we show that our scheme passes this
test. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves a higher model shift when
compared to a noise injection scheme while requiring a lesser bandwidth secret
channel.

TL;DR: 将最优传输（OT）引入偏微分方程（PDE）的算子学习，通过将几何嵌入问题转化为OT问题，提升了灵活性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统几何学习方法依赖网格或点云表示，限制了复杂几何的处理能力。

Result: 在3D表面模拟中，通过2D潜在空间表示显著提升了计算效率，实验显示在RANS方程上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OT方法在几何可变性强的数据集中表现优异，具有更高的准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: We propose integrating optimal transport (OT) into operator learning for
partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Classical
geometric learning methods typically represent domains as meshes, graphs, or
point clouds. Our approach generalizes discretized meshes to mesh density
functions, formulating geometry embedding as an OT problem that maps these
functions to a uniform density in a reference space. Compared to previous
methods relying on interpolation or shared deformation, our OT-based method
employs instance-dependent deformation, offering enhanced flexibility and
effectiveness. For 3D simulations focused on surfaces, our OT-based neural
operator embeds the surface geometry into a 2D parameterized latent space. By
performing computations directly on this 2D representation of the surface
manifold, it achieves significant computational efficiency gains compared to
volumetric simulation. Experiments with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations (RANS) on the ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets show that our
method achieves better accuracy and also reduces computational expenses in
terms of both time and memory usage compared to existing machine learning
models. Additionally, our model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy on
the FlowBench dataset, underscoring the benefits of employing
instance-dependent deformation for datasets with highly variable geometries.

Method: 1. 针对特定初始状态的条件策略性能置信区间；2. 基于双重稳健估计和预测驱动推断的平均策略性能估计。

Result: 在多个模拟器和真实医疗数据集上的实验表明，新方法能有效覆盖真实值，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能可靠地量化不确定性，适用于高风险领域的策略评估。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods aim to estimate the value of a new
reinforcement learning (RL) policy prior to deployment. Recent advances have
shown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by
generative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.
Unfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods
for using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty
quantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty
estimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we
propose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when
using data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the
policy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\pi}(s_0)$--
such intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To
do so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state
MDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy
performance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly
robust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning
robotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset
from MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still
consistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike
previously proposed methods.

Conclusion: SEM为复杂系统动力学分析提供了通用且高效的工具，尤其在神经科学领域具有潜力。

Abstract: Equation discovery is a fundamental learning task for uncovering the
underlying dynamics of complex systems, with wide-ranging applications in areas
such as brain connectivity analysis, climate modeling, gene regulation, and
physical system simulation. However, many existing approaches rely on accurate
derivative estimation and are limited to first-order dynamical systems,
restricting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we
propose sparse equation matching (SEM), a unified framework that encompasses
several existing equation discovery methods under a common formulation. SEM
introduces an integral-based sparse regression method using Green's functions,
enabling derivative-free estimation of differential operators and their
associated driving functions in general-order dynamical systems. The
effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated through extensive simulations,
benchmarking its performance against derivative-based approaches. We then apply
SEM to electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during multiple oculomotor
tasks, collected from 52 participants in a brain-computer interface experiment.
Our method identifies active brain regions across participants and reveals
task-specific connectivity patterns. These findings offer valuable insights
into brain connectivity and the underlying neural mechanisms.

Result: 在等效突变检测领域达到最先进性能，并生成更具解释性的嵌入空间。

Conclusion: 新框架通过优化类内语义关系，显著提升了模型在等效代码突变检测任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent pre-trained transformer models achieve superior performance in various
code processing objectives. However, although effective at optimizing decision
boundaries, common approaches for fine-tuning them for downstream
classification tasks - distance-based methods or training an additional
classification head - often fail to thoroughly structure the embedding space to
reflect nuanced intra-class semantic relationships. Equivalent code mutant
detection is one of these tasks, where the quality of the embedding space is
crucial to the performance of the models. We introduce a novel framework that
integrates cross-entropy loss with a deep metric learning objective, termed
Cluster Purge Loss. This objective, unlike conventional approaches,
concentrates on adjusting fine-grained differences within each class,
encouraging the separation of instances based on semantical equivalency to the
class center using dynamically adjusted borders. Employing UniXCoder as the
base model, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the
domain of equivalent mutant detection and produces a more interpretable
embedding space.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning hidden graph structures from data

discrete Sobolev spaces on graphs for scalar/vector fields, establishing key
functional properties; (2) Introduces gauge-equivalent nonlinear Schr\"odinger
and Landau--Lifshitz dynamics with provable stable stationary solutions
smoothly dependent on input data and graph weights; (3) Develops a stochastic
gradient algorithm over graph moduli spaces with sparsity regularization.
Theoretically, we guarantee: topological correctness (homology recovery),

Conclusion: Meta Fusion是一种模型无关的灵活框架，在多模态数据融合中表现出色，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal data fusion strategies has become
increasingly essential for improving the predictive power of statistical
machine learning methods across a wide range of applications, from autonomous
driving to medical diagnosis. Traditional fusion methods, including early,
intermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each
offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta
Fusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing
strategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble
learning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various
combinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts
predictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our
approach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it
to flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality.
Theoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the
generalization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms
conventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further
validate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease
detection and neural decoding.

Result: 在NLP、生物信息学和视觉任务中表现与点积注意力相当或更好，同时能耗显著降低。

Conclusion: EcoTransformer提供了一种高效且性能优越的注意力机制替代方案。

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence
models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations
on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we
propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the
Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized
scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT,
exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and
representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data.
  We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation
theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via
effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and
robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures
gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By
treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive
feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.
  The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical
learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic
geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale
simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological
sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph
neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep
learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention
mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven
models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex
domains.

Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the
probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner
first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and
rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such
as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both
resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the
offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm
with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the
online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic
combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic
factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
solutions.

Method: 结合紫外-可见光谱仪和机器学习技术，分两阶段预测葡萄汁属性和葡萄酒产地。

Result: SVM在属性和产地预测任务中表现最优，准确率和F1分数均超过91%，关键波长范围为250-420 nm。

Conclusion: 该技术为葡萄酒行业提供智能分析新方法，推动“智能酒庄”发展。

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to use absorbance data obtained by human tasting
and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) scanning spectrophotometer to predict the
attributes of grape juice (GJ) and to classify the wine's origin, respectively.
The approach combined machine learning (ML) techniques with spectroscopy to
find a relatively simple way to apply them in two stages of winemaking and help
improve the traditional wine analysis methods regarding sensory data and wine's
origins. This new technique has overcome the disadvantages of the complex
sensors by taking advantage of spectral fingerprinting technology and forming a
comprehensive study of the employment of AI in the wine analysis domain. In the
results, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the most efficient and robust in both
attributes and origin prediction tasks. Both the accuracy and F1 score of the
origin prediction exceed 91%. The feature ranking approach found that the more
influential wavelengths usually appear at the lower end of the scan range, 250
nm (nanometers) to 420 nm, which is believed to be of great help for selecting
appropriate validation methods and sensors to extract wine data in future
research. The knowledge of this research provides new ideas and early solutions
for the wine industry or other beverage industries to integrate big data and
IoT in the future, which significantly promotes the development of 'Smart
Wineries'.

TL;DR: MEVO是一个进化框架，通过结合VQ-VAE、扩散模型和进化策略，解决了结构药物设计中数据稀缺的问题，成功生成了高亲和力配体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在结构药物设计（SBDD）中的应用受限于数据稀缺，MEVO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MEVO由三部分组成：VQ-VAE用于分子表示，扩散模型用于分子生成，进化策略用于分子优化。

Result: MEVO成功生成了高亲和力配体，并在KRASG12D抑制剂设计中表现出色。

Conclusion: MEVO为结构药物设计提供了一种高效且数据利用率高的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, particularly diffusion and
auto-regressive models, have revolutionized fields like computer vision and
natural language processing. However, their application to structure-based drug
design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the
limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an
evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale
small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and
effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.
MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule
representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided
molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule
optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently
generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with
predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In
addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to
KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with
similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP
calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an
effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand
design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络架构对性能至关重要，但缺乏通用的结构-准确率映射函数，设计过程依赖启发式或搜索方法。

Method: 构建数据集训练ASNN模型，输入为准确率，输出为架构参数，迭代预测高性能架构。

Result: ASNN在2层和3层架构中均提出优于原始数据的架构，提高了平均测试准确率。

Conclusion: ASNN为架构优化提供了高效替代方案，有望自动化神经网络设计。

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in
determining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function
that maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of
architecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we
propose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to
learn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to
suggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed
datasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and
nodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer
architectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated
trials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs,
and architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used
iteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both
2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that
outperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated
prediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with
improved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize
the performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN
provides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture
optimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network
design. "Parts of the manuscript, including text editing and expression

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于重要性采样的偏移校正方法（IS$^2$C），用于解决部分域自适应（PDA）任务中的标签分布偏移问题，并通过理论证明和实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分域自适应（PDA）任务中，传统方法通过简单加权无法充分挖掘潜在结构并利用标记数据，容易在源域上过拟合。

Method: 提出IS$^2$C方法，通过从构建的采样域中采样新标记数据，校正标签分布偏移，并结合最优传输理论实现条件分布对齐。

Result: 理论证明IS$^2$C能有效控制泛化误差，实验验证其在PDA基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IS$^2$C方法通过采样和分布对齐显著提升了PDA任务的性能，并提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine
learning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain
to a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label
distribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the
label distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,
the simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and
sufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on
the source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based
shift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a
built sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as
the target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the
generalization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for
IS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated
by IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture
distribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be
connected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build
IS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence
criterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the
computation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive
experiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.

Conclusion: TINs为技术分析注入AI潜力，推动算法交易发展。

Abstract: This work proposes that a vast majority of classical technical indicators in
financial analysis are, in essence, special cases of neural networks with fixed
and interpretable weights. It is shown that nearly all such indicators, such as
moving averages, momentum-based oscillators, volatility bands, and other
commonly used technical constructs, can be reconstructed topologically as
modular neural network components. Technical Indicator Networks (TINs) are
introduced as a general neural architecture that replicates and structurally
upgrades traditional indicators by supporting n-dimensional inputs such as
price, volume, sentiment, and order book data. By encoding domain-specific
knowledge into neural structures, TINs modernize the foundational logic of
technical analysis and propel algorithmic trading into a new era, bridging the
legacy of proven indicators with the potential of contemporary AI systems.

Conclusion: Protein-SE(3)为未来算法快速原型设计提供了数学抽象和公开基准。

Abstract: SE(3)-based generative models have shown great promise in protein geometry
modeling and effective structure design. However, the field currently lacks a
modularized benchmark to enable comprehensive investigation and fair comparison
of different methods. In this paper, we propose Protein-SE(3), a new benchmark
based on a unified training framework, which comprises protein scaffolding
tasks, integrated generative models, high-level mathematical abstraction, and
diverse evaluation metrics. Recent advanced generative models designed for
protein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2),
Score Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and
FrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly
investigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical
foundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future
algorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we
release the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework
for SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at

Motivation: 现有方法在挖掘公式化阿尔法因子时因奖励稀疏而效率低下，限制了符号搜索空间的探索并导致训练不稳定。

Method: 提出了轨迹级奖励塑造（TLRS），通过测量部分生成表达式与专家设计公式的子序列级相似性来提供密集中间奖励，并引入奖励中心化机制降低训练方差。

Result: 在六种主要中美股票指数上的实验表明，TLRS显著提升了挖掘因子的预测能力，Rank Information Coefficient提高了9.29%，计算效率大幅提升。

Conclusion: TLRS通过密集奖励和奖励中心化机制，有效解决了奖励稀疏问题，提升了强化学习在金融领域的应用效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of
mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable
investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse
rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits
the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training
process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel
reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards
by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated
expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward
centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive
experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS
significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank
Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping
algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by
reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear
to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成具有严格覆盖保证的预测集，解决了校准数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the
decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To
overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is
to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive
model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference
task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic
labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data
scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently
utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and
estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields
prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions.
Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the
effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络回归器提供了一种高效且无需保留数据的后处理不确定性量化方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important prerequisite for the deployment of
deep learning models in safety-critical areas. Yet, this hinges on the
uncertainty estimates being useful to the extent the prediction intervals are
well-calibrated and sharp. In the absence of inherent uncertainty estimates
(e.g. pretrained models predicting only point estimates), popular approaches
that operate post-hoc include Laplace's method and split conformal prediction
(split-CP). However, Laplace's method can be miscalibrated when the model is
misspecified and split-CP requires sample splitting, and thus comes at the
expense of statistical efficiency. In this work, we construct prediction
intervals for neural network regressors post-hoc without held-out data. This is
achieved by approximating the full conformal prediction method (full-CP).
Whilst full-CP nominally requires retraining the model for every test point and
candidate label, we propose to train just once and locally perturb model
parameters using Gauss-Newton influence to approximate the effect of
retraining. Coupled with linearization of the network, we express the absolute
residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate
label allowing for an efficient procedure that avoids the exhaustive search
over the output space. On standard regression benchmarks and bounding box
localization, we show the resulting prediction intervals are locally-adaptive
and often tighter than those of split-CP.

Conclusion: MIPS通过整合拓扑和空间信息，显著提升了聚合物性质预测的准确性，为聚合物设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Polymers, composed of repeating structural units called monomers, are
fundamental materials in daily life and industry. Accurate property prediction
for polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.
However, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by
the constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,
since the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,
we propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training
framework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and
integrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.
From the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)
and graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we
demonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to
applying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose
to further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).
Moreover, we show the robustness of the "star linking" strategy through Repeat
and Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, "star linking"
strategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,
a common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)
test. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the
capability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial
perspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial
information. Finally, we design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to unify the
topological and spatial information. Experimental validation across eight
diverse polymer property prediction tasks reveals that MIPS achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 微调后的模型在教学帮助性、个性化和创造力方面显著提升。

Conclusion: EduAlign为开发更具教学对齐性的AI导师提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents
unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However,
standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking
alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness,
student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this
gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward
becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign
consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k
educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and
automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness,
Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train
HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM
outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the
consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we
leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then
assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and
general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment
with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This
study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced
and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more
engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with
large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle
with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based
probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire
space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic
graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes
into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal
structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of
synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic
measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both
local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised
learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent
non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy
and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training.
This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning,
with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across
various fields.

Abstract: Identifying upstream processes responsible for wafer defects is challenging
due to the combinatorial nature of process flows and the inherent variability
in processing routes, which arises from factors such as rework operations and
random process waiting times. This paper presents a novel framework for wafer
defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The
proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of
conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling
variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous
physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a
detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm
that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process
trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec
and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using
real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.

Abstract: Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of
which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and
monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that
hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging
because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse
rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among
attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across
attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their
imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based
Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing
multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale
temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic
heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous
graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to
enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of
an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and
implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available

*Kohei Miyaguchi,Masao Joko,Rebekah Sheraw,Tsuyoshi Idé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为轨迹Shapley归因（TSA）的新框架，用于解决半导体制造中跨过程缺陷根因分析的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代半导体制造涉及数千个工艺步骤，跨过程缺陷根因分析极为复杂，传统方法难以应对。

Method: 扩展了Shapley值（SV），提出TSA框架，克服了SV忽略制造过程顺序性和依赖任意参考点的局限性。

Result: 在实验性前端工艺中应用TSA，成功识别与异常缺陷相关的测量项。

Conclusion: TSA为解决复杂制造过程中的缺陷分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: How can we identify problematic upstream processes when a certain type of
wafer defect starts appearing at a quality checkpoint? Given the complexity of
modern semiconductor manufacturing, which involves thousands of process steps,
cross-process root cause analysis for wafer defects has been considered highly
challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework called Trajectory Shapley
Attribution (TSA), an extension of Shapley values (SV), a widely used
attribution algorithm in explainable artificial intelligence research. TSA
overcomes key limitations of standard SV, including its disregard for the
sequential nature of manufacturing processes and its reliance on an arbitrarily
chosen reference point. We applied TSA to a good-bad wafer diagnosis task in
experimental front-end-of-line processes at the NY CREATES Albany NanoTech fab,
aiming to identify measurement items (serving as proxies for process
parameters) most relevant to abnormal defect occurrence.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于元学习的新型聚类方法，无需参数优化且优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有聚类算法存在参数调优复杂、计算复杂度高、可解释性差或精度不足等问题，尤其在大规模数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 使用预训练的Prior-Data Fitted Transformer Network (PFN)，通过少量预聚类样本指导整个数据集的聚类过程，利用注意力机制推断聚类分配。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无预聚类样本时能成功聚类分离良好的数据，且在少量预聚类样本下显著提升性能，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，是现有聚类技术的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Clustering is a core task in machine learning with wide-ranging applications
in data mining and pattern recognition. However, its unsupervised nature makes
it inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from
critical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high
computational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,
especially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a
novel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the
need for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms
state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few
pre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in
a single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted
Transformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes
attention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,
allowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the
learned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just
a few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster
the rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show
that our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any
pre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few
clustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the
state-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to
existing clustering techniques.

Result: 在真实网络数据中测试，WBHT的F1分数提升1.65%至58.76%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: WBHT高效且能检测未发现的异常，适用于关键网络的主动监控和安全防护。

Abstract: We propose the Wasserstein Black Hole Transformer (WBHT) framework for
detecting black hole (BH) anomalies in communication networks. These anomalies
cause packet loss without failure notifications, disrupting connectivity and
leading to financial losses. WBHT combines generative modeling, sequential
learning, and attention mechanisms to improve BH anomaly detection. It
integrates a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with attention
mechanisms for stable training and accurate anomaly identification. The model
uses long-short-term memory layers to capture long-term dependencies and
convolutional layers for local temporal patterns. A latent space encoding
mechanism helps distinguish abnormal network behavior. Tested on real-world
network data, WBHT outperforms existing models, achieving significant
improvements in F1 score (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%). Its efficiency and
ability to detect previously undetected anomalies make it a valuable tool for
proactive network monitoring and security, especially in mission-critical
networks.

Motivation: 研究集中式分布式数据并行训练，旨在改进本地梯度方法在通信效率和模型性能之间的权衡。

Method: 引入Inverse Mean Valley作为锐度度量，将其作为正则化器融入训练目标，提出DPPF算法，通过推拉力量协作寻找平坦最小值。

Result: DPPF在通信效率和泛化性能上优于其他方法，可视化证实其能找到更平坦的最小值，理论分析支持其自稳定性和收敛性。

Conclusion: DPPF通过推拉动态平衡通信和性能，理论保证其泛化和收敛能力，为分布式训练提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural
networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication
efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we
revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better
generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We
introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and
demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We
incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed
training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to
collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that
counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the
Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF
outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better
generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient
averaging, while significantly reducing communication overhead. In addition,
our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter
minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat
valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and
pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further
provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove
convergence in the non-convex setting.

Conclusion: ResCap-DBP通过整合全局蛋白质表示和先进深度学习架构，实现了可靠且可扩展的DBP预测。

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder
with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.

Result: 实验表明，FAST在赛车任务中性能接近从头学习的方法，但训练步数显著减少。

Conclusion: 嵌入驱动的任务相似性估计在迁移学习中具有潜力。

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by
transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such
as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid
source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving
domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must
adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this
work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents
performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed
methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer,
leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent
representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity
between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing
candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel
tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST
achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch
methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings
highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

Abstract: Multi-omics data offer unprecedented insights into complex biological
systems, yet their high dimensionality, sparsity, and intricate interactions
pose significant analytical challenges. Network-based approaches have advanced
multi-omics research by effectively capturing biologically relevant

representing molecular interactions, there remains a need for tools
specifically designed to effectively utilize these network representations

BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end
network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional
representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular
networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of
multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction
techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of
downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN
architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g.,
scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick
adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively
documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics
network analysis in precision medicine.

Motivation: 探索Transformer在复杂非线性任务中如何通过ICL学习未见任务，填补现有研究对简单任务的局限性。

Method: 分析训练过程中注意力权重的阶段动态，引入新的证明技术，研究非线性函数的Lipschitz常数对注意力权重的影响。

Result: 发现注意力权重在早期快速收敛到相关特征，而无关特征衰减较慢且呈现振荡；Lipschitz常数L决定收敛时间，不同L值下预测误差趋近零的时间界限不同。

Conclusion: Transformer在复杂非线性任务中仍能通过ICL学习未见函数，注意力机制能有效聚焦相关特征，Lipschitz常数是影响收敛的关键因素。

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to
produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine
learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform
previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating
parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research
has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus
on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.
To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more
complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire
in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise
dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token
and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually
converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and
exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques
that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate
L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify
that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor
governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these
insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a
threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction
error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task
functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with
highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of
transformers for unseen functions.

Abstract: Machine learning has been making great success in many application areas.
However, for the non-expert practitioners, it is always very challenging to
address a machine learning task successfully and efficiently. Finding the
optimal machine learning model or the hyperparameter combination set from a
large number of possible alternatives usually requires considerable expert
knowledge and experience. To tackle this problem, we propose a combined
Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under
a unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the
hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple
evaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each
arm using the Bayesian optimization. Then, ASF can early discard the
poor-performed arms adaptively using a Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model.
Furthermore, a Softmax model is employed to adaptively allocate available
resources for each promising arm that advances to the next round. The arm with
a higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources.
Experimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model
selection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and
better prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic
machine learning methods. Moreover, BOASF achieves better anytime performance
under various time budgets.

Method: 提出WEEP（弱凸包络分段惩罚），基于弱凸包络框架，具有完全可微性和L-平滑性。

Result: WEEP在信号和图像去噪任务中优于L1范数和其他非凸稀疏正则化器。

Conclusion: WEEP解决了统计性能与计算可行性之间的冲突，为稀疏正则化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩方法（MM）和广义矩方法（GMM）在高维数据或需要高阶矩时，计算和存储复杂度呈指数增长，尤其是GMM还需估计大型权重矩阵，导致计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出对角线加权的广义矩方法（DGMM），并设计了一种高效且数值稳定的算法，无需显式计算或存储矩张量。

Result: 数值研究表明，DGMM在估计误差和运行时间上均优于MM和GMM。

Conclusion: DGMM是一种在高维数据中更高效、更稳定的矩估计方法。

Abstract: Since Pearson [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A,
185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling
data as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods
have proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)
improves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments
appropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of
MM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods
impractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are
required. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it
additionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these
bottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a
balance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical
stability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly
separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a
computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the
DGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We
implement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of
DGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while
requiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM. The code and data will
be available upon publication at https://github.com/liu-lzhang/dgmm.

Result: 基于Shapley值的稀疏化在保持预测性能的同时显著降低图复杂度。

Conclusion: Shapley值方法提升了GNN的推理效率和可解释性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in
Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN
explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be
aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many
explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their
applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods
assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a
theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many
subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers,
Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges
while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that
Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while
significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and
efficiency in GNN inference.

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型有望提升全球降水监测能力。

Abstract: Incomplete satellite-based precipitation presents a significant challenge in
global monitoring. For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
(GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital
characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current
interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study,
we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task
and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models.
Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct
complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from
infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training
was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We
generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps.
Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces
more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to
conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global
precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有图主动学习方法在超图中依赖“团扩展”技术，破坏高阶结构信息，导致性能不佳，因此需要一种原生超图主动学习方法。

Method: HIAL将超图主动学习问题转化为影响力最大化任务，提出基于“高阶交互感知”传播机制的双视角影响力函数，评估节点的特征空间覆盖和拓扑影响力。

Result: 在七个公开数据集上的实验表明，HIAL在性能、效率、通用性和鲁棒性上显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: HIAL为超图主动学习提供了一种高效且强大的新范式。

Abstract: In recent years, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have demonstrated immense
potential in handling complex systems with high-order interactions. However,
acquiring large-scale, high-quality labeled data for these models is costly,
making Active Learning (AL) a critical technique. Existing Graph Active
Learning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques
like "clique expansion," which destroys the high-order structural information
crucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.
To address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a
native active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs. We
innovatively reformulate the Hypergraph Active Learning (HAL) problem as an
Influence Maximization task. The core of HIAL is a dual-perspective influence
function that, based on our novel "High-Order Interaction-Aware (HOI-Aware)"
propagation mechanism, synergistically evaluates a node's feature-space
coverage (via Magnitude of Influence, MoI) and its topological influence (via
Expected Diffusion Value, EDV). We prove that this objective function is
monotone and submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm
with a formal (1-1/e) approximation guarantee. Extensive experiments on seven
public datasets demonstrate that HIAL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, efficiency, generality, and
robustness, establishing an efficient and powerful new paradigm for active
learning on hypergraphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoKGR是一种混合专家框架，通过自适应路径探索提升知识图谱推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络在知识图谱推理中采用固定路径探索策略，难以适应多样化的语言上下文和语义细微差别。

Method: MoKGR包含两个互补组件：长度专家混合（自适应选择路径长度）和剪枝专家混合（保留最有信息量的路径）。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，MoKGR在传导和归纳设置下均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 个性化路径探索在知识图谱推理中具有显著有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured
knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and
contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks
(GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting
their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts
framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary
components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights
candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific
reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate
paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths
for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR
demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings,
validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出DmC框架，解决跨域离线强化学习中目标数据有限时的数据集不平衡和部分域重叠问题，通过k-NN和扩散模型提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要大量目标数据，不适用于目标数据有限的场景，且存在数据集不平衡和部分域重叠问题。

Method: 使用k-NN估计域接近度，避免神经网络过拟合，并通过扩散模型生成与目标域更匹配的源样本。

Result: 在MuJoCo环境中，DmC显著优于现有方法，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: DmC在目标数据有限的情况下有效解决了跨域离线强化学习的关键挑战。

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample
efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key
challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to
the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring
domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or
mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods
often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited
target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,
which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to
overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in
uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset
of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these
issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with
limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor
($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network
training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain
proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate
additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus
enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,
we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain
offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在适应新政策或自定义政策时存在局限性，需解决多模态内容过滤的灵活性和可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用“先例”而非固定政策，提出收集高质量先例的批判-修订机制，并利用先例进行预测的两种策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在少样本和全数据集场景下优于现有方法，且对新政策具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于先例的方法显著提升了护栏的灵活性和适应性，适用于多政策场景。

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉高阶图特征和保持特征多样性方面存在不足，MPCCL旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 采用多尺度粗化策略和一对多对比学习范式，结合图重建损失和KL散度确保节点表示一致性。

Result: 在ACM数据集上NMI提升15.24%，在Citeseer、Cora和DBLP等小规模数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: MPCCL通过创新方法有效解决了图聚类中的关键问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: This study introduces the Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and
Contrastive Learning (MPCCL) model, a novel approach for attributed graph
clustering that effectively bridges critical gaps in existing methods,
including long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss.
Traditional methods often struggle to capture high-order graph features due to
their reliance on low-order attribute information, while contrastive learning
techniques face limitations in feature diversity by overemphasizing local
neighborhood structures. Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,
though reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.
MPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening
strategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the
merging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential
structural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive
learning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and
cluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature
masking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during
multi-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL
divergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures
cross-scale consistency of node representations. Experimental evaluations
reveal that MPCCL achieves a significant improvement in clustering performance,
including a remarkable 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and notable
robust gains on smaller-scale datasets such as Citeseer, Cora and DBLP.

Conclusion: 神经表示可作为光学光线追踪的替代方案，具有潜力。

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used technique for modeling optical systems,
involving sequential surface-by-surface computations, which can be
computationally intensive. We propose Ray2Ray, a novel method that leverages
implicit neural representations to model optical systems with greater
efficiency, eliminating the need for surface-by-surface computations in a
single pass end-to-end model. Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted
from a given source and their corresponding rays after passing through a given
optical system in a physically accurate manner. We train Ray2Ray on nine
off-the-shelf optical systems, achieving positional errors on the order of
1{\mu}m and angular deviations on the order 0.01 degrees in the estimated
output rays. Our work highlights the potential of neural representations as a
proxy for optical raytracer.

Result: KOBO在合成基准函数和实际应用（如助听器个性化、生成模型）中表现优异，显著降低样本需求。

Conclusion: KOBO方法在低样本预算下高效优化黑盒函数，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Black box optimization (BBO) focuses on optimizing unknown functions in
high-dimensional spaces. In many applications, sampling the unknown function is
expensive, imposing a tight sample budget. Ongoing work is making progress on
reducing the sample budget by learning the shape/structure of the function,
known as kernel learning. We propose a new method to learn the kernel of a
Gaussian Process. Our idea is to create a continuous kernel space in the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and run an auxiliary optimization to
identify the best kernel. Results show that the proposed method, Kernel
Optimized Blackbox Optimization (KOBO), outperforms state of the art by
estimating the optimal at considerably lower sample budgets. Results hold not
only across synthetic benchmark functions but also in real applications. We
show that a hearing aid may be personalized with fewer audio queries to the
user, or a generative model could converge to desirable images from limited
user ratings.

  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking

Result: 在多种数据集和模型下，STAFF在补全误差和组公平性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: STAFF在公平性和性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Group fairness is important to consider in tensor decomposition to prevent
discrimination based on social grounds such as gender or age. Although few
works have studied group fairness in tensor decomposition, they suffer from
performance degradation. To address this, we propose STAFF(Sparse Tensor
Augmentation For Fairness) to improve group fairness by minimizing the gap in
completion errors of different groups while reducing the overall tensor
completion error. Our main idea is to augment a tensor with augmented entities
including sufficient observed entries to mitigate imbalance and group bias in
the sparse tensor. We evaluate \method on tensor completion with various
datasets under conventional and deep learning-based tensor models. STAFF
consistently shows the best trade-off between completion error and group
fairness; at most, it yields 36% lower MSE and 59% lower MADE than the
second-best baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）的分布式特性导致全局模型易受攻击，且需要大量客户端设备协调，区块链虽提供了一种去中心化解决方案，但传统共识机制（如PoW）资源消耗大，效率低，尤其在无线和资源有限的设备上。

Method: 提出DAG-AFL框架，开发了一种考虑时间新鲜性、节点可达性和模型准确性的tip选择算法，并采用基于DAG的可信验证策略。

Conclusion: DAG-AFL有效解决了异步客户端参与和数据异构性问题，同时限制了区块链引入的资源开销，显著提升了FL的性能。

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability
of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices
pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure
solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in
recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of
Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and
compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are
wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and
data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead
introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based
Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection
algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model
accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments
on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model
accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

Conclusion: 论文通过ReA和双阶段框架揭示了近似遗忘算法的隐私风险，并提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables the removal of specific data from ML models to
uphold the right to be forgotten. While approximate unlearning algorithms offer
efficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to
adequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these
algorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks
targeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless
of model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new
attack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,
we propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation
between residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning
processes. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior
attacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To
mitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase
approximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned
data traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from
"pseudo-convergence", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but
still preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification
and generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach
maintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack
accuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full
retraining from scratch.

Result: 相比传统方法，神经网络在非线性区域表现更优，且适用于多种飞行条件。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，未来可扩展至更复杂神经网络架构。

Abstract: Aerodynamic analysis during aircraft design usually involves methods of
varying accuracy and spatial resolution, which all have their advantages and
disadvantages. It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which
effectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed
quantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a
linear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural
networks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The
network training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data
usually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse
but more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation
data to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step
involves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic
errors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of
the entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer
perceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established
method based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical
solutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides
solutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight
mechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed
training strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex
neural network architectures in the future.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is challenged by the trade-off between
search space exploration and efficiency, especially for complex tasks. While
recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static
search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose
PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by
real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for
consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS
consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For
image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86%
while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically
produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results
demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS
across diverse vision tasks.

Abstract: The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving
under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study
evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on
well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses
about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical
models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as
the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the
parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known
for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to
their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not
been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the
challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on
pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural
network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical
observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele
frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on
simulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the
distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Cholesky分解中新的枢轴选择策略，通过连接贝叶斯非参数推断中的贪婪熵最大化，提出更高效的算法，并在高斯过程任务中验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cholesky分解在对称正定矩阵的线性系统中至关重要，但传统枢轴选择策略（如对角最大元素）可能效率不足。本文旨在通过贝叶斯非参数推断的视角改进枢轴选择。

Method: 提出新的枢轴选择策略，基于贪婪熵最大化思想，并设计高效实现。算法支持动态更新观察信息，并针对稀疏回归和迭代求解器任务进行优化。

Result: 新策略在高斯过程任务（稀疏回归和迭代求解器）中表现优于传统基线，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 新枢轴选择策略显著提升Cholesky分解的效率，适用于多种任务，计算成本低。

Abstract: The Cholesky decomposition is a fundamental tool for solving linear systems
with symmetric and positive definite matrices which are ubiquitous in linear
algebra, optimization, and machine learning. Its numerical stability can be
improved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows
and columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how
accurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,
thus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early
termination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest
value on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this
strategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in
active learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail
and deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The
resulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data
set, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally
benefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the
new selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse
regression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers. Our results
show that the proposed selection strategies are either on par or, in most
cases, outperform traditional baselines while requiring a negligible amount of
additional computation.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过操纵数据样本来人为满足公平性标准，并探讨了如何检测这种操纵行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI算法在现实应用中的广泛部署，证明其合规性成为重要挑战。欧盟AI法案要求检查可能的偏见行为，而全球公平性度量（如差异影响）高度依赖样本分布。

Method: 研究通过熵或最优传输投影在公平性约束下修改经验分布的方法，分析如何规避公平性检查，并提出检测数据操纵的建议。

Result: 实验验证了在经典表格数据集中修改分布以符合公平性约束的方法，并提供了检测操纵的建议。

Conclusion: 研究为审计者提供了检测数据操纵的工具，同时揭示了潜在规避公平性检查的方式。

Abstract: Proving the compliance of AI algorithms has become an important challenge
with the growing deployment of such algorithms for real-life applications.
Inspecting possible biased behaviors is mandatory to satisfy the constraints of
the regulations of the EU Artificial Intelligence's Act. Regulation-driven
audits increasingly rely on global fairness metrics, with Disparate Impact
being the most widely used. Yet such global measures depend highly on the
distribution of the sample on which the measures are computed. We investigate
first how to manipulate data samples to artificially satisfy fairness criteria,
creating minimally perturbed datasets that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the original distribution while satisfying prescribed
fairness constraints. Then we study how to detect such manipulation. Our
analysis (i) introduces mathematically sound methods for modifying empirical
distributions under fairness constraints using entropic or optimal transport
projections, (ii) examines how an auditee could potentially circumvent fairness
inspections, and (iii) offers recommendations to help auditors detect such data
manipulations. These results are validated through experiments on classical
tabular datasets in bias detection.

Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced
diagnostic tools. We propose an explainable AI system combining BERT (for
textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a
novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance
on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is
established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF
pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for
intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824
numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance
rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value.
This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型在不同领域表现不一，且传统集成方法未考虑模型不确定性，限制了鲁棒性。

Method: UEC将确定性嵌入转化为概率嵌入，基于不确定性计算自适应权重，并引入不确定性感知的相似性评分。

Result: 在检索、分类和语义相似性任务上，UEC显著提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UEC通过不确定性建模，为嵌入集成提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. While
numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across
domains, and no single model consistently excels across all tasks. This
variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary
strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic
embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their
robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these
limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC
first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc
manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding
uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss.
Additionally, UEC introduces an uncertainty-aware similarity function that
directly incorporates uncertainty into similarity scoring. Extensive
experiments on retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity benchmarks
demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by
leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.

Method: 利用RAGTruth语料库的令牌级标注和复现的logits，分析幻觉信号如何依赖于令牌在幻觉片段中的位置。

Result: 首个幻觉令牌的信号更强且更易检测。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对令牌级幻觉的深入理解，并发布了分析框架和代码。

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major
concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token
level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the
variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully
understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and
reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position
within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of
token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token
carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We
release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and
metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

Abstract: Due to the extensive availability of operation data, data-driven methods show
strong capabilities in predicting building energy loads. Buildings with similar
features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in
their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to
capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach
using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation,
graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building
characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph
convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction.
Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced.
Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior
performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive,
highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in
capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.

Abstract: Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series
data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings.
This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for
time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We
thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through
application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our
analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention
architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or
privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an
add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1)
combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up
clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations;
(3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting
explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods
that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our
understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making
interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose
the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time
series analytics.

Result: 理论证明了可达状态流形的维度与动作空间维度相关，实验在MuJoCo环境和玩具环境中验证了这一结论。

Conclusion: 通过引入局部流形学习层，论文展示了理论结果在高自由度控制环境中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to its successful
application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite
these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and
action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous
state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally
attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a
semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show
that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low
dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional
nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,
under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order
of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its
kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the
action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo
environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying
dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by
introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function
networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high
degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse
representations.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主观或依赖专业设备，需开发客观、高效的方法检测帕金森病患者的步态功能障碍。

Method: 使用124名参与者的EEG信号和临床数据，训练BiSAM模型，测试不同模态和EEG通道子集。

Result: 多模态模型（BiSAM-8和BiSAM-4）分类准确率达88%，显著优于单模态模型。

Conclusion: 多模态BiSAM模型为帕金森病步态功能障碍提供了一种高效、可扩展的检测方法。

Abstract: Parkinson Disease (PD) often results in motor and cognitive impairments,
including gait dysfunction, particularly in patients with freezing of gait
(FOG). Current detection methods are either subjective or reliant on
specialized gait analysis tools. This study aims to develop an objective,
data-driven, and multi-modal classification model to detect gait dysfunction in
PD patients using resting-state EEG signals combined with demographic and
clinical variables. We utilized a dataset of 124 participants: 42 PD patients
with FOG (PDFOG+), 41 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 41 age-matched healthy
controls. Features extracted from resting-state EEG and descriptive variables
(age, education, disease duration) were used to train a novel Bi-cephalic
Self-Attention Model (BiSAM). We tested three modalities: signal-only,
descriptive-only, and multi-modal, across different EEG channel subsets
(BiSAM-63, -16, -8, and -4). Signal-only and descriptive-only models showed
limited performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 55% and 68%, respectively.
In contrast, the multi-modal models significantly outperformed both, with
BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4 achieving the highest classification accuracy of 88%. These
results demonstrate the value of integrating EEG with objective descriptive
features for robust PDFOG+ detection. This study introduces a multi-modal,
attention-based architecture that objectively classifies PDFOG+ using minimal
EEG channels and descriptive variables. This approach offers a scalable and
efficient alternative to traditional assessments, with potential applications
in routine clinical monitoring and early diagnosis of PD-related gait
dysfunction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签数据流挖掘面临分布演化、高维标签空间和标签稀疏性等挑战，需动态适应概念漂移。

Method: iHOMER采用增量层次聚类和全局树学习器，结合漂移检测机制动态调整标签分区。

Result: 在23个数据集上，iHOMER比5种全局基线方法提升23%，比12种局部基线方法提升32%。

Conclusion: iHOMER在在线多标签分类中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和动态适应性。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查在用户行为建模中存在局限性（如用户疲劳、不完整响应），需要结合其他信号提升效果。

Method: 提出LANTERN架构，通过选择性门控、残差连接和跨注意力机制，将调查数据作为主要信号，仅在相关时引入外部模态。

Result: LANTERN在多标签预测中优于仅依赖调查的基线方法，并通过消融实验验证了选择性模态依赖的优势。

Conclusion: LANTERN为以调查为中心的行为建模提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling user behavior is critical across many industries where understanding
preferences, intent, or decisions informs personalization, targeting, and
strategic outcomes. Surveys have long served as a classical mechanism for
collecting such behavioral data due to their interpretability, structure, and
ease of deployment. However, surveys alone are inherently limited by user
fatigue, incomplete responses, and practical constraints on their length making
them insufficient for capturing user behavior. In this work, we present LANTERN
(Late-Attentive Network for Enriched Response Modeling), a modular architecture
for modeling user behavior by fusing adaptive survey responses with
supplemental contextual signals. We demonstrate the architectural value of
maintaining survey primacy through selective gating, residual connections and
late fusion via cross-attention, treating survey data as the primary signal
while incorporating external modalities only when relevant. LANTERN outperforms
strong survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction of survey responses. We
further investigate threshold sensitivity and the benefits of selective
modality reliance through ablation and rare/frequent attribute analysis.
LANTERN's modularity supports scalable integration of new encoders and evolving
datasets. This work provides a practical and extensible blueprint for behavior
modeling in survey-centric applications.

Result: 模型在零样本场景下显著提升基线性能，尤其在数据稀缺时表现优于现有预训练模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为CPI预测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，尤其在数据有限时表现突出。

Abstract: Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously
uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI)
prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of
real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately
during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)
Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often
overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are
essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)
Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands
significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence
reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.
Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent
pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's
effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various
baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the
baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging
zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where
training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at

Motivation: 解决PINNs在四阶偏微分方程中精度受限的问题，推动其在工程应用中的广泛采用。

Method: 结合截断傅里叶级数和深度神经网络，通过两阶段优化策略（Adam和L-BFGS）和自适应权重平衡实现高精度。

Result: L2误差达到1.94×10⁻⁷，比标准PINNs提高17倍，比传统数值方法提高15-500倍。

Conclusion: 通过合理设计，机器学习可以在科学计算中实现超高精度，甚至超越传统数值方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of
$10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a
perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering
applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural
architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2
error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and
\(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach
synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal
behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A
systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery:
exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically
degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase
optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing
enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation
achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By
addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity
to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is
achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific
computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical
methods.

Method: 使用激活修补技术分析模型的关键组件，重点关注多层感知机（MLP）和多头注意力（MHA）层的作用。

Result: 早期MLP层不仅处理输入句法结构，还处理语义内容，将角色标记转化为丰富表示；中段MHA层利用这些表示塑造输出；特定注意力头对种族和肤色身份表现出过度关注。

Conclusion: 角色信息通过MLP和MHA层在模型中编码，影响推理过程，特定注意力头可能引入偏见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting
diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences
a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a
first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode
persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and
synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,
synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world
graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused
mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their
usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.
  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework
designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge
attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation
task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features
a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph
structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual
modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.
  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:
system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from
IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate
dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of
realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.

*Rongyao Cai,Ming Jin,Qingsong Wen,Kexin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARSD提出了一种新的无监督域适应框架，通过表示空间分解实现域适应，优于现有12种方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列分析中域偏移问题，现有方法忽略特征内在组成。

Method: DARSD包含三个组件：对抗学习共同不变基、原型伪标签机制和混合对比优化策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上优于12种算法，35/53场景表现最优。

Conclusion: DARSD通过分解表示空间有效实现域适应，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where
models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target
domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature
distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring
their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce
DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly
realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition.
Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just
alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed
representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An
adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features
into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A
prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target
features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid
contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature
clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR,
HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms,
achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.

*Chao Wu,Zhenyi Wang,Kangxian Xie,Naresh Kumar Devulapally,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Mingchen Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAE Debias是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，用于减少文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型中的性别偏见。它通过稀疏自编码器识别并抑制性别相关方向，无需重新训练或修改模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型常表现出性别偏见，例如职业与性别的刻板关联。现有方法依赖CLIP过滤或提示工程，效果有限且需模型特定调整。

Method: 使用预训练的k稀疏自编码器识别性别相关方向，并在推理时抑制这些方向，从而生成更性别平衡的图像。

Result: 在多个T2I模型（如Stable Diffusion系列）上验证，SAE Debias显著减少性别偏见且保持生成质量。

Conclusion: SAE Debias是首个利用稀疏自编码器干预T2I性别偏见的工作，为构建公平的生成AI提供了可解释的工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: SmallThinker是一系列专为本地设备设计的轻量级大语言模型（LLM），通过创新的架构设计解决了计算能力弱、内存有限和存储慢的问题，实现了在普通CPU上的高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型主要依赖GPU云基础设施，限制了其在本地设备上的部署。SmallThinker旨在打破这一限制，为本地设备提供高效的LLM解决方案。

Method: 1. 采用两级稀疏结构（MoE与稀疏前馈网络结合）降低计算需求；2. 设计预注意力路由器以隐藏存储延迟；3. 使用NoPE-RoPE混合稀疏注意力机制减少KV缓存需求。

Result: SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B和SmallThinker-21B-A3B在性能上超越更大规模的LLM，并在普通CPU上实现高效推理（20 tokens/s），内存占用仅为1GB和8GB。

Conclusion: SmallThinker通过创新的架构设计，成功实现了在本地设备上高效运行LLM的目标，为轻量级模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability
boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud
infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs
natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:
weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional
approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect
SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our
innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints
into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure
combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward
networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model
capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a
pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch
expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding
storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for
memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to
slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and
SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and
even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly
eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both
models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB
and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at
hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用非结构化数据估计个性化治疗效果的方法，通过引入近似'插件'方法和两种理论基础的估计器，解决了混杂偏差和抽样偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖结构化协变量，限制了其在非结构化数据中的应用。非结构化数据（如临床笔记或医学图像）在因果推断中具有巨大潜力。

Method: 1. 提出近似'插件'方法，直接训练于非结构化数据的神经表示；2. 引入两种理论基础的估计器，利用混杂因子的结构化测量避免偏差；3. 针对非代表性子集的抽样偏差，提出回归校正方法。

Result: 实验表明，插件方法在非结构化数据上直接训练，尽管简单，但在所有设置中均表现优异。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效解决了非结构化数据中的混杂和抽样偏差问题，展示了在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely
on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data.
Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable
application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or
medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate
'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured
data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the
method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two
theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the
confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment
effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When
these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative
subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address
this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the
non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be
well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in
method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong
empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MDM-OC的新框架，用于实现可扩展、无干扰且可逆的模型组合，解决了任务干扰、灾难性遗忘和不可逆性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的机器学习模型需要不断更新、组合和选择性撤销，但现有方法存在任务干扰、灾难性遗忘或不可逆性等问题。

Method: 通过将任务特定模型编码为共享基础的增量，并投影到正交子空间以避免冲突，再通过梯度优化合并为统一模型。

Result: 在视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，MDM-OC在准确性、后向迁移和撤销保真度上优于现有方法，且内存高效。

Conclusion: MDM-OC为模块化和合规的AI系统设计提供了理论解决方案。

Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually
updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing
approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task
interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose
Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework
that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of
fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared
base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These
projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a
unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports
continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such
as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and
synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language
processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in
accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining
memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a
principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

TL;DR: 论文提出LoRA-PAR框架，通过双系统分区数据和参数，结合SFT和RL两阶段微调，降低参数使用量并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法未针对不同任务需求（快速直觉与多步逻辑推理）优化数据和参数分配，受《思考，快与慢》启发，提出双系统分区方法。

Method: 分类任务数据并通过角色扮演和投票分区参数，采用SFT和RL两阶段微调策略。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在减少参数使用量的同时，性能达到或超过现有PEFT基线。

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR通过双系统分区和两阶段微调，实现了参数高效与性能提升的平衡。

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）在黑盒性质下难以部署于高透明度需求领域的问题。

Method: 提出组合函数网络（CFNs），支持序列、并行和条件组合模式，完全可微分，可通过标准梯度下降高效训练。

Result: 在多个领域（如符号回归和图像分类）中表现优异，CIFAR-10准确率达96.24%，优于现有可解释模型。

Conclusion: CFNs结合了深度学习的表达能力和可解释性，为性能与可解释性并重的应用提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deliver impressive performance but their
black-box nature limits deployment in high-stakes domains requiring
transparency. We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel
framework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary
mathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable
approaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse
compositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling
complex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation
is that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through
standard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple
domains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep
hierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive
performance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while
outperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting
Machines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training
of deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined
mathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where
both performance and accountability are paramount.

Method: 使用HCP数据集的任务型和静息态fMRI数据，比较KRR、GNN和TGNN模型的表现，评估指标包括R2分数、Pearson相关系数和平均绝对误差。

Result: 任务型fMRI表现优于静息态fMRI；GNN结合SC和FC表现最佳，但优势不显著；TGNN在任务型fMRI中表现良好，但在静息态数据中较差。

Conclusion: 选择合适的模型架构和特征表示对充分利用神经影像数据的时空信息至关重要，多模态图感知DL模型和Transformer方法在认知预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers
insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with
potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of
neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked
classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep
learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN))
for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language
task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean
absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses
directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive
behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity
(SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest
performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using
FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model
temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based
approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance
aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data
as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting
appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage
the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to
combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of
Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a
comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing
brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.

Conclusion: 单固定项Shapley值计算适用于独立观测异常定位，依赖观测情况需进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly
localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly
model for full control, experiments indicate that using a single fixed term in
the Shapley value calculation achieves a lower complexity anomaly localization
test, with the same probability of error, as a test using the Shapley value for

Motivation: 传统FMA在优化过程中性能停滞，原因是数据集增长导致新数据点的影响减弱。

Method: 提出序列化数据集构建方法，仅保留最近添加的指定数量数据点。

Result: 数值实验表明，改进的FMA能以更少的函数评估获得更低成本的解。

Conclusion: 限制数据集大小能有效提升FMA的优化性能。

Abstract: Black-box (BB) optimization problems aim to identify an input that minimizes
the output of a function (the BB function) whose input-output relationship is
unknown. Factorization machine with annealing (FMA) is a promising approach to
this task, employing a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model to
iteratively guide the solution search via an Ising machine. Although FMA has
demonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its
performance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.
One contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points
in the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points
are accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted
within the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the
prediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for
sequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the
most recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the
influence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions
with fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.

Motivation: 解决MI-EEG解码中因受试者间差异大和标记数据有限导致的负迁移和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 利用BFM动态选择相关源域，使用Cauchy-Schwarz和条件CS散度进行特征级和决策级对齐。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上优于现有方法，验证了BFM选择的高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了MI-EEG解码性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external
systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG
decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and
limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new
users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods
indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the
large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative
transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches
focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit
dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability
to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a
novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model
(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant
sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)
and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and
decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class
discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the
scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces
training time without sacrificing performance.

Result: 调整后的注意力矩阵在语言模型和简单视觉Transformer中验证性能提升。

Conclusion: Transformer可解释为概率模型，调整注意力矩阵能有效提升性能。

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic interpretation of transformers as unrolled
inference steps assuming a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model from the
ProbDR framework. Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers
perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the
transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather
than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We
demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and
thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a
language model and a simple vision transformer.

Motivation: 现有多任务优化方法主要关注通过优化器中心策略解决任务冲突，但忽略了共享表示空间中任务互补性的潜力。

Result: 在四个多任务基准测试中，Rep-MTL表现出色，即使在基础权重策略下也能实现竞争性性能提升。

Conclusion: Rep-MTL通过表示层操作有效平衡了任务特定学习和跨任务共享，展示了其在多任务学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The
project page is available at HERE.
