### [1] [Robust control for multi-legged elongate robots in noisy environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15788)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于通信理论的新型多足机器人控制框架，结合机械智能（MI）和计算智能（CI），实现了在复杂地形中的鲁棒运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人依赖于高带宽传感和计算，且训练过程缺乏通用性。本文旨在开发一种简单、通用的控制方法。

Method: 将足地接触视为基本主动接触（bac），类比通信中的比特传输，通过冗余和反馈控制（MI和CI）实现鲁棒运动。

Result: 机器人能在噪声地形中稳定运动（每周期约半个身长），地形噪声高度超过机器人高度的两倍。

Conclusion: 该框架为多足机器人控制提供了系统化基础，支持极端环境下的敏捷运动。

Abstract: Modern two and four legged robots exhibit impressive mobility on complex
terrain, largely attributed to advancement in learning algorithms. However,
these systems often rely on high-bandwidth sensing and onboard computation to
perceive/respond to terrain uncertainties. Further, current locomotion
strategies typically require extensive robot-specific training, limiting their
generalizability across platforms. Building on our prior research connecting
robot-environment interaction and communication theory, we develop a new
paradigm to construct robust and simply controlled multi-legged elongate robots
(MERs) capable of operating effectively in cluttered, unstructured
environments. In this framework, each leg-ground contact is thought of as a
basic active contact (bac), akin to bits in signal transmission. Reliable
locomotion can be achieved in open-loop on "noisy" landscapes via sufficient
redundancy in bacs. In such situations, robustness is achieved through passive
mechanical responses. We term such processes as those displaying mechanical
intelligence (MI) and analogize these processes to forward error correction
(FEC) in signal transmission. To augment MI, we develop feedback control
schemes, which we refer to as computational intelligence (CI) and such
processes analogize automatic repeat request (ARQ) in signal transmission.
Integration of these analogies between locomotion and communication theory
allow analysis, design, and prediction of embodied intelligence control schemes
(integrating MI and CI) in MERs, showing effective and reliable performance
(approximately half body lengths per cycle) on complex landscapes with terrain
"noise" over twice the robot's height. Our work provides a foundation for
systematic development of MER control, paving the way for terrain-agnostic,
agile, and resilient robotic systems capable of operating in extreme
environments.

### [2] [Steering Your Diffusion Policy with Latent Space Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15799)
*Andrew Wagenmaker,Mitsuhiko Nakamoto,Yunchu Zhang,Seohong Park,Waleed Yagoub,Anusha Nagabandi,Abhishek Gupta,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DSRL的方法，通过强化学习在扩散策略的潜在噪声空间中进行调整，实现了高效的自主策略改进，避免了传统方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界场景中，行为克隆策略初始表现不佳时，传统方法需要额外的人类演示，成本高且耗时。强化学习虽能自主改进，但样本效率低。

Method: 提出DSRL方法，在扩散策略的潜在噪声空间上运行强化学习，无需修改基础策略权重，仅需黑盒访问。

Result: DSRL在模拟和真实机器人任务中表现出高样本效率和有效性能，适用于预训练通用策略的调整。

Conclusion: DSRL是一种高效且实用的方法，能够实现快速自主策略改进，适用于真实世界的机器人任务。

Abstract: Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved
impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where
initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel
open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically
require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their
behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement
learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy
improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of
samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast
autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL.
Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC
methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL):
adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that
DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC
policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement.
Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning
diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy
at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks,
and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample
efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.

### [3] [Context Matters! Relaxing Goals with LLMs for Feasible 3D Scene Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15828)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合经典规划和大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法，以解决机器人规划中感知局限和动作落地问题，通过分层目标松弛实现任务适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典规划方法在真实场景中因感知局限和动作落地问题表现不佳，而LLMs虽能利用常识推理生成规划，但常导致不可行或不安全的计划。

Method: 提出了一种分层规划方法，结合经典规划和LLMs，通过目标松弛机制逐步调整任务目标，使其适应机器人能力。

Result: 方法在3D场景图中表现出高效的任务适应和执行能力，在复杂场景中优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合经典规划和LLMs，有效解决了机器人规划中的适应性和可行性问题，为复杂任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Classical planning in AI and Robotics addresses complex tasks by shifting
from imperative to declarative approaches (e.g., PDDL). However, these methods
often fail in real scenarios due to limited robot perception and the need to
ground perceptions to planning predicates. This often results in heavily
hard-coded behaviors that struggle to adapt, even with scenarios where goals
can be achieved through relaxed planning. Meanwhile, Large Language Models
(LLMs) lead to planning systems that leverage commonsense reasoning but often
at the cost of generating unfeasible and/or unsafe plans. To address these
limitations, we present an approach integrating classical planning with LLMs,
leveraging their ability to extract commonsense knowledge and ground actions.
We propose a hierarchical formulation that enables robots to make unfeasible
tasks tractable by defining functionally equivalent goals through gradual
relaxation. This mechanism supports partial achievement of the intended
objective, suited to the agent's specific context. Our method demonstrates its
ability to adapt and execute tasks effectively within environments modeled
using 3D Scene Graphs through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. We also show how this method succeeds in complex scenarios where
other benchmark methods are more likely to fail. Code, dataset, and additional
material are released to the community.

### [4] [SafeMimic: Towards Safe and Autonomous Human-to-Robot Imitation for Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15847)
*Arpit Bahety,Arnav Balaji,Ben Abbatematteo,Roberto Martín-Martín*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SafeMimic框架通过单次人类视频演示，让机器人安全自主地学习移动操作技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人从人类视频中学习移动操作任务的挑战，减少对人类监控的依赖。

Method: 解析视频为语义和动作片段，转换为第一人称视角，并通过安全验证采样候选动作。

Result: 机器人能安全高效地学习多步骤移动操作行为，并在不同环境和用户中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SafeMimic为机器人学习复杂任务提供了一种安全、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: For robots to become efficient helpers in the home, they must learn to
perform new mobile manipulation tasks simply by watching humans perform them.
Learning from a single video demonstration from a human is challenging as the
robot needs to first extract from the demo what needs to be done and how,
translate the strategy from a third to a first-person perspective, and then
adapt it to be successful with its own morphology. Furthermore, to mitigate the
dependency on costly human monitoring, this learning process should be
performed in a safe and autonomous manner. We present SafeMimic, a framework to
learn new mobile manipulation skills safely and autonomously from a single
third-person human video. Given an initial human video demonstration of a
multi-step mobile manipulation task, SafeMimic first parses the video into
segments, inferring both the semantic changes caused and the motions the human
executed to achieve them and translating them to an egocentric reference. Then,
it adapts the behavior to the robot's own morphology by sampling candidate
actions around the human ones, and verifying them for safety before execution
in a receding horizon fashion using an ensemble of safety Q-functions trained
in simulation. When safe forward progression is not possible, SafeMimic
backtracks to previous states and attempts a different sequence of actions,
adapting both the trajectory and the grasping modes when required for its
morphology. As a result, SafeMimic yields a strategy that succeeds in the
demonstrated behavior and learns task-specific actions that reduce exploration
in future attempts. Our experiments show that our method allows robots to
safely and efficiently learn multi-step mobile manipulation behaviors from a
single human demonstration, from different users, and in different
environments, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across seven
tasks

### [5] [PRISM-Loc: a Lightweight Long-range LiDAR Localization in Urban Environments with Topological Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15849)
*Kirill Muravyev,Vasily Yuryev,Oleg Bulichev,Dmitry Yudin,Konstantin Yakovlev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PRISM-Loc是一种基于拓扑地图的定位方法，用于大型环境中的实时定位，结合全局地点识别和局部位姿估计，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在长距离路径中，使用密集全局激光雷达地图进行实时定位可能困难且内存消耗大，因此需要利用拓扑地图。

Method: 提出PRISM-Loc方法，采用双重定位流程：全局地点识别和局部位姿估计。局部位姿估计使用基于2D特征和点优化的激光雷达扫描匹配算法。

Result: 在3公里路径的ITLP-Campus数据集上测试，PRISM-Loc在质量和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRISM-Loc是一种高效且性能优越的拓扑地图定位方法，适用于大型环境。

Abstract: Localization in the environment is one of the crucial tasks of navigation of
a mobile robot or a self-driving vehicle. For long-range routes, performing
localization within a dense global lidar map in real time may be difficult, and
the creation of such a map may require much memory. To this end, leveraging
topological maps may be useful. In this work, we propose PRISM-Loc -- a
topological map-based approach for localization in large environments. The
proposed approach leverages a twofold localization pipeline, which consists of
global place recognition and estimation of the local pose inside the found
location. For local pose estimation, we introduce an original lidar scan
matching algorithm, which is based on 2D features and point-based optimization.
We evaluate the proposed method on the ITLP-Campus dataset on a 3 km route, and
compare it against the state-of-the-art metric map-based and place
recognition-based competitors. The results of the experiments show that the
proposed method outperforms its competitors both quality-wise and
computationally-wise.

### [6] [Semantic and Feature Guided Uncertainty Quantification of Visual Localization for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15851)
*Qiyuan Wu,Mark Campbell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于自动驾驶视觉定位的轻量级传感器误差模型，通过学习图像特征和语义信息预测二维误差分布，并验证了其在复杂环境下的不确定性量化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中，传感器测量与深度学习网络的不确定性量化至关重要。

Method: 采用轻量级传感器误差模型，结合图像特征和语义信息预测误差分布，并利用高斯混合模型改进不确定性预测。

Result: 在Ithaca365数据集上验证，结果显示在恶劣天气和光照条件下，误差分布更符合高斯混合模型而非高斯分布。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉未标注的上下文因素，为自动驾驶定位提供更准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep
learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for
safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an
uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for
autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our
approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor
error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to
2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation
conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly
capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic
vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the
accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset,
which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both
the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with
Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show
that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor
weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian
Mixture model.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在非结构化环境中使用触觉传感和强化学习改进机器人抓取和移动物体的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非结构化环境中，机器人需要更高的环境感知能力以应对不确定性，而传统摄像头存在遮挡和视野限制，因此转向触觉传感。

Method: 利用触觉传感确定物体姿态，结合强化学习减少抓取尝试次数，并通过人类示例缩短训练时间。

Result: 触觉传感和强化学习的结合提高了机器人对物体姿态的估计精度，并减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: 触觉传感与强化学习的结合为机器人在复杂环境中的操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To use robots in more unstructured environments, we have to accommodate for
more complexities. Robotic systems need more awareness of the environment to
adapt to uncertainty and variability. Although cameras have been predominantly
used in robotic tasks, the limitations that come with them, such as occlusion,
visibility and breadth of information, have diverted some focus to tactile
sensing. In this thesis, we explore the use of tactile sensing to determine the
pose of the object using the temporal features. We then use reinforcement
learning with tactile collisions to reduce the number of attempts required to
grasp an object resulting from positional uncertainty from camera estimates.
Finally, we use information provided by these tactile sensors to a
reinforcement learning agent to determine the trajectory to take to remove an
object from a restricted passage while reducing training time by pertaining
from human examples.

### [8] [CooperRisk: A Driving Risk Quantification Pipeline with Multi-Agent Cooperative Perception and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15868)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于V2X的风险量化框架CooperRisk，通过多智能体感知信息融合和未来时间戳的风险量化，生成可解释的场景风险地图，并利用基于学习的协同预测模型捕捉多智能体交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单车辆系统在复杂密集场景中的感知范围有限且易受遮挡，V2X技术虽能共享感知信息，但如何确保风险可解释性并理解多智能体交互仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 设计了基于Transformer的风险导向预测模型，考虑多模态和多智能体因素，确保场景一致的行为预测，避免冲突预测导致过度保守的风险量化。

Result: 在V2XPnP数据集上评估，冲突率降低了44.35%，验证了其在风险量化上的优越性能。

Conclusion: CooperRisk框架通过多智能体协同感知和风险量化，显著提升了自动驾驶的安全性和可解释性。

Abstract: Risk quantification is a critical component of safe autonomous driving,
however, constrained by the limited perception range and occlusion of
single-vehicle systems in complex and dense scenarios. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) paradigm has been a promising solution to sharing complementary
perception information, nevertheless, how to ensure the risk interpretability
while understanding multi-agent interaction with V2X remains an open question.
In this paper, we introduce the first V2X-enabled risk quantification pipeline,
CooperRisk, to fuse perception information from multiple agents and quantify
the scenario driving risk in future multiple timestamps. The risk is
represented as a scenario risk map to ensure interpretability based on risk
severity and exposure, and the multi-agent interaction is captured by the
learning-based cooperative prediction model. We carefully design a
risk-oriented transformer-based prediction model with multi-modality and
multi-agent considerations. It aims to ensure scene-consistent future behaviors
of multiple agents and avoid conflicting predictions that could lead to overly
conservative risk quantification and cause the ego vehicle to become overly
hesitant to drive. Then, the temporal risk maps could serve to guide a model
predictive control planner. We evaluate the CooperRisk pipeline in a real-world
V2X dataset V2XPnP, and the experiments demonstrate its superior performance in
risk quantification, showing a 44.35% decrease in conflict rate between the ego
vehicle and background traffic participants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在复杂场景中难以高效训练安全策略，需改进。

Method: 采用HRL框架，高层决策选择安全子目标，低层执行；GCCP模块预测碰撞风险。

Result: 实验表明，该方法收敛更快，安全性优于传统RL方法。

Conclusion: HRL结合GCCP显著提升了自动驾驶任务的样本效率和安全性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) exhibits remarkable potential in addressing
autonomous driving tasks. However, it is difficult to train a sample-efficient
and safe policy in complex scenarios. In this article, we propose a novel
hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with a goal-conditioned
collision prediction (GCCP) module. In the hierarchical structure, the GCCP
module predicts collision risks according to different potential subgoals of
the ego vehicle. A high-level decision-maker choose the best safe subgoal. A
low-level motion-planner interacts with the environment according to the
subgoal. Compared to traditional RL methods, our algorithm is more
sample-efficient, since its hierarchical structure allows reusing the policies
of subgoals across similar tasks for various navigation scenarios. In
additional, the GCCP module's ability to predict both the ego vehicle's and
surrounding vehicles' future actions according to different subgoals, ensures
the safety of the ego vehicle throughout the decision-making process.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method converges to an
optimal policy faster and achieves higher safety than traditional RL methods.

Conclusion: eCAV为自动驾驶车辆的安全算法验证和大规模场景仿真提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles edge closer to widespread adoption, enhancing road
safety through collision avoidance and minimization of collateral damage
becomes imperative. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, which include
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-cloud
(V2C), are being proposed as mechanisms to achieve this safety improvement.
  Simulation-based testing is crucial for early-stage evaluation of Connected
Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) control systems, offering a safer and more
cost-effective alternative to real-world tests. However, simulating large 3D
environments with many complex single- and multi-vehicle sensors and
controllers is computationally intensive. There is currently no evaluation
framework that can effectively evaluate realistic scenarios involving large
numbers of autonomous vehicles.
  We propose eCAV -- an efficient, modular, and scalable evaluation platform to
facilitate both functional validation of algorithmic approaches to increasing
road safety, as well as performance prediction of algorithms of various V2X
technologies, including a futuristic Vehicle-to-Edge control plane and
correspondingly designed control algorithms. eCAV can model up to 256 vehicles
running individual control algorithms without perception enabled, which is
$8\times$ more vehicles than what is possible with state-of-the-art
alternatives. %faster than state-of-the-art alternatives that can simulate
$8\times$ fewer vehicles. With perception enabled, eCAV simulates up to 64
vehicles with a step time under 800ms, which is $4\times$ more and $1.5\times$
faster than the state-of-the-art OpenCDA framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决在真实灾害响应中首次部署的基于sUAS的ML损害评估系统所面临的操作性挑战，以提升其效率和实用性。

Method: 通过分析在佛罗里达州飓风Helene和Debby中收集的无人机影像数据（包括2次飞行任务和3.0千兆像素的影像），以及宾夕法尼亚州飓风Debby后的人机影像数据（436张正射影像，136.5千兆像素），识别出四个主要挑战。

Conclusion: 提出了三个研究方向，以改进ML模型的能力，适应实际中广泛的空间分辨率变化、处理空间不对齐问题，并减少对无线连接的依赖，从而提升sUAS在灾害响应中的操作效率。

Abstract: This paper details four principal challenges encountered with machine
learning (ML) damage assessment using small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) at
Hurricanes Debby and Helene that prevented, degraded, or delayed the delivery
of data products during operations and suggests three research directions for
future real-world deployments. The presence of these challenges is not
surprising given that a review of the literature considering both datasets and
proposed ML models suggests this is the first sUAS-based ML system for disaster
damage assessment actually deployed as a part of real-world operations. The
sUAS-based ML system was applied by the State of Florida to Hurricanes Helene
(2 orthomosaics, 3.0 gigapixels collected over 2 sorties by a Wintra WingtraOne
sUAS) and Debby (1 orthomosaic, 0.59 gigapixels collected via 1 sortie by a
Wintra WingtraOne sUAS) in Florida. The same model was applied to crewed aerial
imagery of inland flood damage resulting from post-tropical remnants of
Hurricane Debby in Pennsylvania (436 orthophotos, 136.5 gigapixels), providing
further insights into the advantages and limitations of sUAS for disaster
response. The four challenges (variationin spatial resolution of input imagery,
spatial misalignment between imagery and geospatial data, wireless
connectivity, and data product format) lead to three recommendations that
specify research needed to improve ML model capabilities to accommodate the
wide variation of potential spatial resolutions used in practice, handle
spatial misalignment, and minimize the dependency on wireless connectivity.
These recommendations are expected to improve the effective operational use of
sUAS and sUAS-based ML damage assessment systems for disaster response.

Abstract: Signal source localization has been a problem of interest in the multi-robot
systems domain given its applications in search \& rescue and hazard
localization in various industrial and outdoor settings. A variety of
multi-robot search algorithms exist that usually formulate and solve the
associated autonomous motion planning problem as a heuristic model-free or
belief model-based optimization process. Most of these algorithms however
remains tested only in simulation, thereby losing the opportunity to generate
knowledge about how such algorithms would compare/contrast in a real physical
setting in terms of search performance and real-time computing performance. To
address this gap, this paper presents a new lab-scale physical setup and
associated open-source software pipeline to evaluate and benchmark multi-robot
search algorithms. The presented physical setup innovatively uses an acoustic
source (that is safe and inexpensive) and small ground robots (e-pucks)
operating in a standard motion-capture environment. This setup can be easily
recreated and used by most robotics researchers. The acoustic source also
presents interesting uncertainty in terms of its noise-to-signal ratio, which
is useful to assess sim-to-real gaps. The overall software pipeline is designed
to readily interface with any multi-robot search algorithm with minimal effort
and is executable in parallel asynchronous form. This pipeline includes a
framework for distributed implementation of multi-robot or swarm search
algorithms, integrated with a ROS (Robotics Operating System)-based software
stack for motion capture supported localization. The utility of this novel
setup is demonstrated by using it to evaluate two state-of-the-art multi-robot
search algorithms, based on swarm optimization and batch-Bayesian Optimization
(called Bayes-Swarm), as well as a random walk baseline.

### [15] [A Scalable Post-Processing Pipeline for Large-Scale Free-Space Multi-Agent Path Planning with PiBT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16748)
*Arjo Chakravarty,Michael X. Grey,M. A. Viraj J. Muthugala,Mohan Rajesh Elara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合优先级继承回溯（PiBT）和安全感知路径平滑的混合规划框架，适用于大规模自由空间多智能体路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大规模多智能体路径规划中难以兼顾最优性和可扩展性，或依赖于网格假设。

Method: 扩展PiBT至8连通网格，结合安全感知路径平滑和局部交互感知，采用SIPP进行碰撞解决。

Result: 方法可扩展到500+智能体，运行时优于现有方法，在稀疏环境中生成接近最优的轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架是机器人系统中可扩展、实时多智能体导航的有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Free-space multi-agent path planning remains challenging at large scales.
Most existing methods either offer optimality guarantees but do not scale
beyond a few dozen agents, or rely on grid-world assumptions that do not
generalize well to continuous space. In this work, we propose a hybrid,
rule-based planning framework that combines Priority Inheritance with
Backtracking (PiBT) with a novel safety-aware path smoothing method. Our
approach extends PiBT to 8-connected grids and selectively applies
string-pulling based smoothing while preserving collision safety through local
interaction awareness and a fallback collision resolution step based on Safe
Interval Path Planning (SIPP). This design allows us to reduce overall path
lengths while maintaining real-time performance. We demonstrate that our method
can scale to over 500 agents in large free-space environments, outperforming
existing any-angle and optimal methods in terms of runtime, while producing
near-optimal trajectories in sparse domains. Our results suggest this framework
is a promising building block for scalable, real-time multi-agent navigation in
robotics systems operating beyond grid constraints.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单麦克风的移动机器人实时声源定位方法，填补了单麦克风在线定位的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有声源定位方法依赖多麦克风阵列，限制了机器人听觉系统的适用性。

Method: 开发了一个轻量级神经网络（43k参数）提取混响信号的时间信息，结合扩展卡尔曼滤波器实现在线定位。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和优势。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了移动机器人单麦克风在线声源定位，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Accurately estimating sound source positions is crucial for robot audition.
However, existing sound source localization methods typically rely on a
microphone array with at least two spatially preconfigured microphones. This
requirement hinders the applicability of microphone-based robot audition
systems and technologies. To alleviate these challenges, we propose an online
sound source localization method that uses a single microphone mounted on a
mobile robot in reverberant environments. Specifically, we develop a
lightweight neural network model with only 43k parameters to perform real-time
distance estimation by extracting temporal information from reverberant
signals. The estimated distances are then processed using an extended Kalman
filter to achieve online sound source localization. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve online sound source localization
using a single microphone on a moving robot, a gap that we aim to fill in this
work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our
approach. To benefit the broader research community, we have open-sourced our
code at https://github.com/JiangWAV/single-mic-SSL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于能量模型（EBM）的学习方法，用于加速机器人抓取-放置任务中的共享抓取预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分析方法在解决共享抓取问题时需单独评估每个候选抓取，计算开销大。

Method: 引入能量模型（EBM），通过结合初始和目标物体位姿的可行抓取能量，预测共享抓取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了抓取选择性能，数据效率更高，并能泛化到未见过的抓取和相似形状物体。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了搜索空间，提高了机器人抓取-放置任务的效率。

Abstract: This work proposes a learning method to accelerate robotic pick-and-place
planning by predicting shared grasps. Shared grasps are defined as grasp poses
feasible to both the initial and goal object configurations in a pick-and-place
task. Traditional analytical methods for solving shared grasps evaluate grasp
candidates separately, leading to substantial computational overhead as the
candidate set grows. To overcome the limitation, we introduce an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) that predicts shared grasps by combining the energies of feasible
grasps at both object poses. This formulation enables early identification of
promising candidates and significantly reduces the search space. Experiments
show that our method improves grasp selection performance, offers higher data
efficiency, and generalizes well to unseen grasps and similarly shaped objects.

Abstract: We present Kalman-filter Assisted Reinforcement Learner (KARL) for dynamic
object tracking and grasping over eye-on-hand (EoH) systems, significantly
expanding such systems capabilities in challenging, realistic environments. In
comparison to the previous state-of-the-art, KARL (1) incorporates a novel
six-stage RL curriculum that doubles the system's motion range, thereby greatly
enhancing the system's grasping performance, (2) integrates a robust Kalman
filter layer between the perception and reinforcement learning (RL) control
modules, enabling the system to maintain an uncertain but continuous 6D pose
estimate even when the target object temporarily exits the camera's
field-of-view or undergoes rapid, unpredictable motion, and (3) introduces
mechanisms to allow retries to gracefully recover from unavoidable policy
execution failures. Extensive evaluations conducted in both simulation and
real-world experiments qualitatively and quantitatively corroborate KARL's
advantage over earlier systems, achieving higher grasp success rates and faster
robot execution speed. Source code and supplementary materials for KARL will be

Conclusion: ViTacFormer通过视觉-触觉融合与课程学习，显著提升了机器人灵巧操作的性能与适应性。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a cornerstone capability for robotic systems aiming
to interact with the physical world in a human-like manner. Although
vision-based methods have advanced rapidly, tactile sensing remains crucial for
fine-grained control, particularly in unstructured or visually occluded
settings. We present ViTacFormer, a representation-learning approach that
couples a cross-attention encoder to fuse high-resolution vision and touch with
an autoregressive tactile prediction head that anticipates future contact
signals. Building on this architecture, we devise an easy-to-challenging
curriculum that steadily refines the visual-tactile latent space, boosting both
accuracy and robustness. The learned cross-modal representation drives
imitation learning for multi-fingered hands, enabling precise and adaptive
manipulation. Across a suite of challenging real-world benchmarks, our method
achieves approximately 50% higher success rates than prior state-of-the-art
systems. To our knowledge, it is also the first to autonomously complete
long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks that demand highly precise control
with an anthropomorphic hand, successfully executing up to 11 sequential stages
and sustaining continuous operation for 2.5 minutes.

Conclusion: DualTHOR为开发更强大的视觉语言模型提供了更全面的仿真环境，有助于提升其在真实世界任务中的表现。

Abstract: Developing embodied agents capable of performing complex interactive tasks in
real-world scenarios remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. Although
recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to
train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified
robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution,
which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these
issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex
dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our
simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm
collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also
introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through
physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios.
Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and
generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal
that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited
robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the
importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied
tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ds199895/DualTHOR.git.

Conclusion: HetNet能有效集成到生产线中，实现实时、鲁棒的异常检测，提升工业检测系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in automated industrial manufacturing can
significantly enhance production efficiency and product quality. Existing
methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled
imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in
complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and
illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and
localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative
patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative
distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global
feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation
module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal
patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted
extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior
performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on
MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on
other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its
capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems
across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that
HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust
and real-time anomaly detection. Codes, images and videos are published on the
project website at: https://zihuatanejoyu.github.io/HetNet/

Motivation: 传统动力学模型在长期预测中误差累积，LNNs通过保留物理规律解决这一问题。

Method: 评估四种动力学模型：全阶正向动力学、对角化质量矩阵、全阶逆向动力学与降阶模型。

Result: LNNs样本效率提升10倍，预测精度提高2-10倍，计算复杂度降低。

Conclusion: LNNs在四足机器人动力学建模中表现优越，适合实时控制与部署。

Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) present a principled and interpretable
framework for learning the system dynamics by utilizing inductive biases. While
traditional dynamics models struggle with compounding errors over long
horizons, LNNs intrinsically preserve the physical laws governing any system,
enabling accurate and stable predictions essential for sustainable locomotion.
This work evaluates LNNs for infinite horizon planning in quadrupedal robots
through four dynamics models: (1) full-order forward dynamics (FD) training and
inference, (2) diagonalized representation of Mass Matrix in full order FD, (3)
full-order inverse dynamics (ID) training with FD inference, (4) reduced-order
modeling via torso centre-of-mass (CoM) dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that
LNNs bring improvements in sample efficiency (10x) and superior prediction
accuracy (up to 2-10x) compared to baseline methods. Notably, the
diagonalization approach of LNNs reduces computational complexity while
retaining some interpretability, enabling real-time receding horizon control.
These findings highlight the advantages of LNNs in capturing the underlying
structure of system dynamics in quadrupeds, leading to improved performance and
efficiency in locomotion planning and control. Additionally, our approach
achieves a higher control frequency than previous LNN methods, demonstrating
its potential for real-world deployment on quadrupeds.

Abstract: Modern agriculture faces escalating challenges: increasing demand for food,
labor shortages, and the urgent need to reduce environmental impact.
Agricultural robotics has emerged as a promising response to these pressures,
enabling the automation of precise and suitable field operations. In
particular, robots equipped with implements for tasks such as weeding or sowing
must interact delicately and accurately with the crops and soil. Unlike robots
in other domains, these agricultural platforms typically use rigidly mounted
implements, where the implement's position is more critical than the robot's
center in determining task success. Yet, most control strategies in the
literature focus on the vehicle body, often neglecting the acctual working
point of the system. This is particularly important when considering new
agriculture practices where crops row are not necessary straights. This paper
presents a predictive control strategy targeting the implement's reference
point. The method improves tracking performance by anticipating the motion of
the implement, which, due to its offset from the vehicle's center of rotation,
is prone to overshooting during turns if not properly accounted for.

Conclusion: FlowRAM在高精度任务中表现出色，为机器人操作提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in high-precision tasks is essential for numerous
industrial and real-world applications where accuracy and speed are required.
Yet current diffusion-based policy learning methods generally suffer from low
computational efficiency due to the iterative denoising process during
inference. Moreover, these methods do not fully explore the potential of
generative models for enhancing information exploration in 3D environments. In
response, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative
models to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal
information processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule,
which allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene
comprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate
state space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear
computational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to
learn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the
learning process while maintaining performance. We verify the effectiveness of
the FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a
remarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it
outperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate. Additionally,
FlowRAM is able to generate physically plausible actions for a variety of
real-world tasks in less than 4 time steps, significantly increasing inference
speed.

Conclusion: ControlVLA在少量演示下表现出高效性和扩展性，适用于长时任务和未知对象与背景的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning real-world robotic manipulation is challenging, particularly when
limited demonstrations are available. Existing methods for few-shot
manipulation often rely on simulation-augmented data or pre-built modules like
grasping and pose estimation, which struggle with sim-to-real gaps and lack
extensibility. While large-scale imitation pre-training shows promise, adapting
these general-purpose policies to specific tasks in data-scarce settings
remains unexplored. To achieve this, we propose ControlVLA, a novel framework
that bridges pre-trained VLA models with object-centric representations via a
ControlNet-style architecture for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, to
introduce object-centric conditions without overwriting prior knowledge,
ControlVLA zero-initializes a set of projection layers, allowing them to
gradually adapt the pre-trained manipulation policies. In real-world
experiments across 6 diverse tasks, including pouring cubes and folding
clothes, our method achieves a 76.7% success rate while requiring only 10-20
demonstrations -- a significant improvement over traditional approaches that
require more than 100 demonstrations to achieve comparable success. Additional
experiments highlight ControlVLA's extensibility to long-horizon tasks and
robustness to unseen objects and backgrounds.

Abstract: Intelligent devices for supporting persons with vision impairment are
becoming more widespread, but they are lacking behind the advancements in
intelligent driver assistant system. To make a first step forward, this work
discusses the integration of the risk model technology, previously used in
autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems, into an assistance
device for persons with vision impairment. The risk model computes a
probabilistic collision risk given object trajectories which has previously
been shown to give better indications of an object's collision potential
compared to distance or time-to-contact measures in vehicle scenarios. In this
work, we show that the risk model is also superior in warning persons with
vision impairment about dangerous objects. Our experiments demonstrate that the
warning accuracy of the risk model is 67% while both distance and
time-to-contact measures reach only 51% accuracy for real-world data.

approach effectively addresses key challenges, such as preventing infeasible
pose references and enhancing robustness against disturbances, as well as
considering multirotor's actual physical limitations. Numerical simulations

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a prominent research

However, their performance in endoscopy robotics, particularly endoscopy
capsule robots that perform actions within the digestive system, remains
unexplored. The integration of VLA models into endoscopy robots allows more

Abstract: Unrestricted multi-agent racing presents a significant research challenge,
requiring decision-making at the limits of a robot's operational capabilities.
While previous approaches have either ignored spatiotemporal information in the
decision-making process or been restricted to single-opponent scenarios, this
work enables arbitrary multi-opponent head-to-head racing while considering the
opponents' future intent. The proposed method employs a KF-based multi-opponent
tracker to effectively perform opponent ReID by associating them across
observations. Simultaneously, spatial and velocity GPR is performed on all
observed opponent trajectories, providing predictive information to compute the
overtaking maneuvers. This approach has been experimentally validated on a
physical 1:10 scale autonomous racing car, achieving an overtaking success rate
of up to 91.65% and demonstrating an average 10.13%-point improvement in safety
at the same speed as the previous SotA. These results highlight its potential
for high-performance autonomous racing.

Abstract: Fully re-orientable small spacecraft are now supported by commercial
technologies, allowing them to point their instruments in any direction and
capture images, with short notice. When combined with improved onboard
processing, and implemented on a constellation of inter-communicable
satellites, this intelligent agility can significantly increase responsiveness
to transient or evolving phenomena. We demonstrate a ground-based and onboard
algorithmic framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control,
inter-satellite communication, intelligent prediction and planning to schedule
the time-varying, re-orientation of agile, small satellites in a constellation.
Planner intelligence is improved by updating the predictive value of future
space-time observations based on shared observations of evolving episodic
precipitation and urban flood forecasts. Reliable inter-satellite communication
within a fast, dynamic constellation topology is modeled in the physical,
access control and network layer. We apply the framework on a representative
24-satellite constellation observing 5 global regions. Results show
appropriately low latency in information exchange (average within 1/3rd
available time for implicit consensus), enabling the onboard scheduler to
observe ~7% more flood magnitude than a ground-based implementation. Both
onboard and offline versions performed ~98% better than constellations without
agility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对ISSPG和ESSPG两种行星齿轮箱架构的客观比较，且现有设计依赖启发式方法而非系统优化。

Method: 提出设计框架，基于性能需求和电机规格优化执行器参数，生成并分析两种架构的优化齿轮箱设计。

Result: 对于T-motor U12，ISSPG在5:1至7:1的低传动比范围内更优，而ESSPG在7:1至11:1范围内更优。实验验证了优化模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 设计框架能够有效优化执行器参数，为不同传动比范围选择最佳架构提供了依据。

Abstract: Legged robots, such as quadrupeds and humanoids, require high-performance
actuators for efficient locomotion. Quasi-Direct-Drive (QDD) actuators with
single-stage planetary gearboxes offer low inertia, high efficiency, and
transparency. Among planetary gearbox architectures, Internal (ISSPG) and
External Single-Stage Planetary Gearbox (ESSPG) are the two predominant
designs. While ISSPG is often preferred for its compactness and high torque
density at certain gear ratios, no objective comparison between the two
architectures exists. Additionally, existing designs rely on heuristics rather
than systematic optimization. This paper presents a design framework for
optimally selecting actuator parameters based on given performance requirements
and motor specifications. Using this framework, we generate and analyze various
optimized gearbox designs for both architectures. Our results demonstrate that
for the T-motor U12, ISSPG is the superior choice within the lower gear ratio
range of 5:1 to 7:1, offering a lighter design. However, for gear ratios
exceeding 7:1, ISSPG becomes infeasible, making ESSPG the better option in the
7:1 to 11:1 range. To validate our approach, we designed and optimized two
actuators for manufacturing: an ISSPG with a 6.0:1 gear ratio and an ESSPG with
a 7.2:1 gear ratio. Their respective masses closely align with our optimization
model predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our methodology.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通环境中需实时与人类交互并做出安全决策，但人类行为的不可预测性带来了挑战。

Method: 采用三种DRL算法构建值网络和策略网络，指导交互式MCTS的在线推理过程，并结合动态轨迹规划器和跟踪控制器在CARLA中实现。

Result: 实验表明BIDA提升了交互推理效率，降低了计算成本，并在多种交通条件下表现出更高的安全性、效率和交互理性。

Conclusion: BIDA为自动驾驶车辆在动态交通场景中的交互决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In complex real-world traffic environments, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to
interact with other traffic participants while making real-time and
safety-critical decisions accordingly. The unpredictability of human behaviors
poses significant challenges, particularly in dynamic scenarios, such as
multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections. To address this gap, we
design a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) that integrates
interactive Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning
(DRL), aiming to enhance interaction rationality, efficiency and safety of AVs
in dynamic key traffic scenarios. Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL
algorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which
guide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value
update and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory
tracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth
execution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our
BIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs,
but also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety,
efficiency and interaction rationality under varying traffic conditions.

Conclusion: CSC-MPPI通过严格约束和聚类优化，显著提升了轨迹优化性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes Constrained Sampling Cluster Model Predictive Path
Integral (CSC-MPPI), a novel constrained formulation of MPPI designed to
enhance trajectory optimization while enforcing strict constraints on system
states and control inputs. Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic
sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates
suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories.
To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual
gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions
while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure
that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual
gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing
state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories,
enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster.
Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost
is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint
satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex
environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI
outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved
reliability and efficiency. The experimental videos are available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合力控制和优化运动规划的多模态控制框架，用于复杂机器人操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 力控制在高频适应和柔顺交互中表现优异，但在远距离运动和稳定方向上受限；优化运动规划擅长生成无碰撞轨迹，但在动态交互中表现不足。

Method: 将任务分解为子任务，动态分配三种控制模式：纯优化、纯力控制或混合控制。

Result: 在单臂、双臂和多臂操作任务中展示了方法的鲁棒性和精确性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够无缝切换控制模式，适用于自由空间运动和接触丰富的操作任务。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation demands precise control over both contact forces and
motion trajectories. While force control is essential for achieving compliant
interaction and high-frequency adaptation, it is limited to operations in close
proximity to the manipulated object and often fails to maintain stable
orientation during extended motion sequences. Conversely, optimization-based
motion planning excels in generating collision-free trajectories over the
robot's configuration space but struggles with dynamic interactions where
contact forces play a crucial role. To address these limitations, we propose a
multi-modal control framework that combines force control and
optimization-augmented motion planning to tackle complex robotic manipulation
tasks in a sequential manner, enabling seamless switching between control modes
based on task requirements. Our approach decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks, each dynamically assigned to one of three control modes: Pure
optimization for global motion planning, pure force control for precise
interaction, or hybrid control for tasks requiring simultaneous trajectory
tracking and force regulation. This framework is particularly advantageous for
bimanual and multi-arm manipulation, where synchronous motion and coordination
among arms are essential while considering both the manipulated object and
environmental constraints. We demonstrate the versatility of our method through
a range of long-horizon manipulation tasks, including single-arm, bimanual, and
multi-arm applications, highlighting its ability to handle both free-space
motion and contact-rich manipulation with robustness and precision.

Conclusion: DRIVE协议为UGV系统识别提供了标准化方法，并分享了在大型UGV上运行系统识别的经验。

Abstract: Off-road autonomous navigation is a challenging task as it is mainly
dependent on the accuracy of the motion model. Motion model performances are
limited by their ability to predict the interaction between the terrain and the
UGV, which an onboard sensor can not directly measure. In this work, we propose
using the DRIVE protocol to standardize the collection of data for system
identification and characterization of the slip state space. We validated this
protocol by acquiring a dataset with two platforms (from 75 kg to 470 kg) on
six terrains (i.e., asphalt, grass, gravel, ice, mud, sand) for a total of 4.9
hours and 14.7 km. Using this data, we evaluate the DRIVE protocol's ability to
explore the velocity command space and identify the reachable velocities for
terrain-robot interactions. We investigated the transfer function between the
command velocity space and the resulting steady-state slip for an SSMR. An
unpredictability metric is proposed to estimate command uncertainty and help
assess risk likelihood and severity in deployment. Finally, we share our
lessons learned on running system identification on large UGV to help the
community.

dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both
unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We
validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an
average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under

utilizes error feedback and SDT insights to generate recovery strategies and
iteratively revise the action plan. We evaluate our approach using tasks from

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型在遇到训练中未见的视觉干扰物时表现脆弱，影响动作预测和规划。

Method: ReOI通过检测干扰物、修改观测并重新预测，提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，ReOI显著提高任务成功率，尤其在新型干扰物下表现优异。

Conclusion: ReOI是一种简单有效的测试时策略，适用于开放世界中的机器人任务。

Abstract: World models enable robots to "imagine" future observations given current
observations and planned actions, and have been increasingly adopted as
generalized dynamics models to facilitate robot learning. Despite their
promise, these models remain brittle when encountering novel visual distractors
such as objects and background elements rarely seen during training.
Specifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing
downstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for
planning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with
Observation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that
enables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world
scenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable.
Given the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by
identifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways
during world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to
remove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training
distribution. Finally, ReOI "reimagines" future outcomes with the modified
observation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual
consistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach
on a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification,
where the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions
from a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors. Notably, it
improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors,
significantly outperforming action verification that relies on world model
predictions without imagination interventions.

Conclusion: 动态历史感知提示策略显著提升了导航的鲁棒性和上下文感知能力，展示了视觉语言模型在目标导航中的潜力。

Abstract: Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) challenges robots to find objects in
unseen environments, demanding sophisticated reasoning. While Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) show potential, current ObjectNav methods often employ them
superficially, primarily using vision-language embeddings for object-scene
similarity checks rather than leveraging deeper reasoning. This limits
contextual understanding and leads to practical issues like repetitive
navigation behaviors. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot ObjectNav
framework that pioneers the use of dynamic, history-aware prompting to more
deeply integrate VLM reasoning into frontier-based exploration. Our core
innovation lies in providing the VLM with action history context, enabling it
to generate semantic guidance scores for navigation actions while actively
avoiding decision loops. We also introduce a VLM-assisted waypoint generation
mechanism for refining the final approach to detected objects. Evaluated on the
HM3D dataset within Habitat, our approach achieves a 46% Success Rate (SR) and
24.8% Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). These results are comparable to
state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, demonstrating the significant potential of
our history-augmented VLM prompting strategy for more robust and context-aware
robotic navigation.

Abstract: Nonverbal visual symbols and displays play an important role in communication
when humans and robots work collaboratively. However, few studies have
investigated how different types of non-verbal cues affect objective task
performance, especially in a dynamic environment that requires real time
decision-making. In this work, we designed a collaborative navigation task
where the user and the robot only had partial information about the map on each
end and thus the users were forced to communicate with a robot to complete the
task. We conducted our study in a public space and recruited 37 participants
who randomly passed by our setup. Each participant collaborated with a robot
utilizing either animated anthropomorphic eyes and animated icons, or static
anthropomorphic eyes and static icons. We found that participants that
interacted with a robot with animated displays reported the greatest level of
trust and satisfaction; that participants interpreted static icons the best;
and that participants with a robot with static eyes had the highest completion
success. These results suggest that while animation can foster trust with
robots, human-robot communication can be optimized by the addition of familiar
static icons that may be easier for users to interpret. We published our code,
designed symbols, and collected results online at:

Abstract: Natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit
ambiguity and vagueness. For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug
tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches
to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on
end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and
low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to
their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks
specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language
instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable
intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception
module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by
integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities
in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of
current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and
environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging
manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and
multi-object interactions.

how to effectively update policies with this new data. We introduce Compliant
Residual DAgger (CR-DAgger), which contains two novel components: 1) a
Compliant Intervention Interface that leverages compliance control, allowing
humans to provide gentle, accurate delta action corrections without
interrupting the ongoing robot policy execution; and 2) a Compliant Residual
Policy formulation that learns from human corrections while incorporating force
feedback and force control. Our system significantly enhances performance on
precise contact-rich manipulation tasks using minimal correction data,
improving base policy success rates by over 50\% on two challenging tasks (book
flipping and belt assembly) while outperforming both retraining-from-scratch
and finetuning approaches. Through extensive real-world experiments, we provide
practical guidance for implementing effective DAgger in real-world robot
learning tasks. Result videos are available at:

Abstract: The increasingly complex and diverse planetary exploration environment
requires more adaptable and flexible rover navigation strategy. In this study,
we propose a VLM-empowered multi-mode system to achieve efficient while safe
autonomous navigation for planetary rovers. Vision-Language Model (VLM) is used
to parse scene information by image inputs to achieve a human-level
understanding of terrain complexity. Based on the complexity classification,
the system switches to the most suitable navigation mode, composing of
perception, mapping and planning modules designed for different terrain types,
to traverse the terrain ahead before reaching the next waypoint. By integrating
the local navigation system with a map server and a global waypoint generation
module, the rover is equipped to handle long-distance navigation tasks in
complex scenarios. The navigation system is evaluated in various simulation
environments. Compared to the single-mode conservative navigation method, our
multi-mode system is able to bootstrap the time and energy efficiency in a
long-distance traversal with varied type of obstacles, enhancing efficiency by
79.5%, while maintaining its avoidance capabilities against terrain hazards to
guarantee rover safety. More system information is shown at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脱管原因增强的强化学习方法（DRARL），通过识别脱管原因来优化自动驾驶策略，避免无效数据干扰，提升策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶车辆在开放道路上的增多，脱管案例日益普遍，但脱管数据稀缺且部分数据无效（如驾驶员随意干预），限制了策略改进效果。

Method: 提出DRARL方法，利用OOD状态估计模型识别脱管原因，排除无效案例，并在原因增强的想象环境中更新策略。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能准确识别策略相关脱管原因，提升策略对相似案例的处理能力，同时避免策略过度保守。

Conclusion: DRARL为利用脱管案例优化驾驶策略提供了高效方法。

Abstract: With the increasing presence of automated vehicles on open roads under driver
supervision, disengagement cases are becoming more prevalent. While some
data-driven planning systems attempt to directly utilize these disengagement
cases for policy improvement, the inherent scarcity of disengagement data
(often occurring as a single instances) restricts training effectiveness.
Furthermore, some disengagement data should be excluded since the disengagement
may not always come from the failure of driving policies, e.g. the driver may
casually intervene for a while. To this end, this work proposes
disengagement-reason-augmented reinforcement learning (DRARL), which enhances
driving policy improvement process according to the reason of disengagement
cases. Specifically, the reason of disengagement is identified by a
out-of-distribution (OOD) state estimation model. When the reason doesn't
exist, the case will be identified as a casual disengagement case, which
doesn't require additional policy adjustment. Otherwise, the policy can be
updated under a reason-augmented imagination environment, improving the policy
performance of disengagement cases with similar reasons. The method is
evaluated using real-world disengagement cases collected by autonomous driving
robotaxi. Experimental results demonstrate that the method accurately
identifies policy-related disengagement reasons, allowing the agent to handle
both original and semantically similar cases through reason-augmented training.
Furthermore, the approach prevents the agent from becoming overly conservative
after policy adjustments. Overall, this work provides an efficient way to
improve driving policy performance with disengagement cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在协作环境中（如家庭），机器人需要安全高效地接收和交接物体，这是实现人机协作的关键技能。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL）训练多指手进行物体交接，提出了一种基于双四元数的奖励函数，优于欧拉角和旋转矩阵等表示方法。

Result: 训练的策略在未包含于训练分布中的物体和交接过程中的扰动下表现出色，最佳情况下成功率达到94%，且在另一机器人移动时性能仅下降13.8%。

Conclusion: 该策略在新型物体和常见扰动下均表现出鲁棒性，验证了其在现实场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Object handover is an important skill that we use daily when interacting with
other humans. To deploy robots in collaborative setting, like houses, being
able to receive and handing over objects safely and efficiently becomes a
crucial skill. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) for dexterous object handover between two multi-finger hands. Key to this
task is the use of a novel reward function based on dual quaternions to
minimize the rotation distance, which outperforms other rotation
representations such as Euler and rotation matrices. The robustness of the
trained policy is experimentally evaluated by testing w.r.t. objects that are
not included in the training distribution, and perturbations during the
handover process. The results demonstrate that the trained policy successfully
perform this task, achieving a total success rate of 94% in the best-case
scenario after 100 experiments, thereby showing the robustness of our policy
with novel objects. In addition, the best-case performance of the policy
decreases by only 13.8% when the other robot moves during the handover, proving
that our policy is also robust to this type of perturbation, which is common in
real-world object handovers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作通常独立处理PCE和EVE，忽略了雷达空间和多普勒域特征的相互作用，可能引入偏差。研究发现两者存在潜在关联，可相互促进。

Method: 设计了SDDiff模型，改进传统潜在扩散过程：1）引入结合空间占用和多普勒特征的表示；2）设计基于雷达先验的方向性扩散；3）提出迭代多普勒细化增强适应性。

Result: SDDiff显著优于现有基线，EVE准确率提升59%，有效生成密度提高4倍，同时提升PCE的效果和可靠性。

Conclusion: SDDiff通过结合PCE和EVE任务，充分利用空间和多普勒特征的关联，为雷达感知提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Point cloud extraction (PCE) and ego velocity estimation (EVE) are key
capabilities gaining attention in 3D radar perception. However, existing work
typically treats these two tasks independently, which may neglect the interplay
between radar's spatial and Doppler domain features, potentially introducing
additional bias. In this paper, we observe an underlying correlation between 3D
points and ego velocity, which offers reciprocal benefits for PCE and EVE. To
fully unlock such inspiring potential, we take the first step to design a
Spatial-Doppler Diffusion (SDDiff) model for simultaneously dense PCE and
accurate EVE. To seamlessly tailor it to radar perception, SDDiff improves the
conventional latent diffusion process in three major aspects. First, we
introduce a representation that embodies both spatial occupancy and Doppler
features. Second, we design a directional diffusion with radar priors to
streamline the sampling. Third, we propose Iterative Doppler Refinement to
enhance the model's adaptability to density variations and ghosting effects.
Extensive evaluations show that SDDiff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by achieving 59% higher in EVE accuracy, 4X greater
in valid generation density while boosting PCE effectiveness and reliability.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了硬件上量化精度的抓握投掷，推动了动态全身操作的发展。

Abstract: Throwing is a fundamental skill that enables robots to manipulate objects in
ways that extend beyond the reach of their arms. We present a control framework
that combines learning and model-based control for prehensile whole-body
throwing with legged mobile manipulators. Our framework consists of three
components: a nominal tracking policy for the end-effector, a high-frequency
residual policy to enhance tracking accuracy, and an optimization-based module
to improve end-effector acceleration control. The proposed controller achieved
the average of 0.28 m landing error when throwing at targets located 6 m away.
Furthermore, in a comparative study with university students, the system
achieved a velocity tracking error of 0.398 m/s and a success rate of 56.8%,
hitting small targets randomly placed at distances of 3-5 m while throwing at a
specified speed of 6 m/s. In contrast, humans have a success rate of only
15.2%. This work provides an early demonstration of prehensile throwing with
quantified accuracy on hardware, contributing to progress in dynamic whole-body
manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前6D物体姿态估计依赖昂贵的深度传感器，且对透明物体效果不佳；单目深度估计模型（MDEMs）虽能提供深度信息，但缺乏度量精度和泛化能力。

Method: 提出MOMA框架，通过相机校准中的尺度-旋转-平移对齐，结合稀疏真实深度点，实现无需额外数据或模型重训练的单次适配。

Result: MOMA在透明物体上表现优异，并在实际抓取和分拣任务中取得高成功率。

Conclusion: MOMA通过一次性适配解决了单目深度估计的度量精度和泛化问题，适用于多种机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully
completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At
present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth
sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision,
which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras),
and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art
monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths
up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful
zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a
novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover
metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on
MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera
calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate
depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the
testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects,
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on
tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA
achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 研究为多模态学习在点云补全任务中的发展提供了新见解。

Abstract: The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to
reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a
single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of
this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains
largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for
SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that
only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical
self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers,
effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature
representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric
structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC
dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to
state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into
the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be

Result: 实验表明，VLMInferSlow生成的对抗图像可增加计算成本高达128.47%。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁关注VLM的效率鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in real-world
applications. While existing research primarily focuses on improving their
accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of
many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency
robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency
robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model
architecture and parameters -- an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service
settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we
propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness
in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained
efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order
optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that
VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations,
increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%. We hope this research
raises the community's awareness about the efficiency robustness of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练模型，难以应对动态视角，且未调优的LLMs/VLMs性能有限，调优则计算成本高。

Result: 实验表明，WPCL在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，验证了其有效性、鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: WPCL在提升VLN任务性能的同时，保持了计算效率，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of
Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments
based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing
methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely
on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when
using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN
domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results,
their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning
(WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM
knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our
method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental
cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown
that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which
validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法能显著提升碰撞检测性能，尤其在拥堵和动态环境中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过SDF实现了更高精度的3D障碍物形状映射，为自动驾驶领域提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In crowded urban environments where traffic is dense, current technologies
struggle to oversee tight navigation, but surface-level understanding allows
autonomous vehicles to safely assess proximity to surrounding obstacles. 3D or
2D scene mapping of the surrounding objects is an essential task in addressing
the above problem. Despite its importance in dense vehicle traffic conditions,
3D scene reconstruction of object shapes with higher boundary level accuracy is
not yet entirely considered in current literature. The sign distance function
represents any shape through parameters that calculate the distance from any
point in space to the closest obstacle surface, making it more efficient in
terms of storage. In recent studies, researchers have started to formulate
problems with Implicit 3D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving
domain, highlighting the possibility of using sign distance function to map
obstacles effectively. This research addresses this gap by developing a
learning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data
and a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF)
maps. Unlike traditional polygonal representations, this approach has the
potential to map 3D obstacle shapes with more boundary-level details. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that this method would significantly enhance
collision detection performance, particularly in congested and dynamic
environments.

Motivation: 理解高级视觉单元如何编码特征组合以支持图像识别，并揭示其不变性变换的多样性。

Method: 提出Stretch-and-Squeeze（SnS）框架，通过双目标优化问题探究单元的不变性和对抗敏感性。

Result: SnS发现CNN中不同层级的表征对图像变换（如亮度、纹理、姿态）的响应不同，且鲁棒网络的生成图像更易被人类识别。

Conclusion: SnS为视觉系统的建模提供了新工具，支持鲁棒CNN作为视觉系统模型的更高保真度。

Abstract: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is
critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that
support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically
infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the
manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is
key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS),
an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically
characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames
these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe
invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the
representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while
preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks
perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit
activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image
variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those
produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target
unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically
depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization:
pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching
mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively.
Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by
human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher
fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, pose a significant challenge to
autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and other safety-critical
applications by severely degrading visual information. We introduce
ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly
optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities.
A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as
light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes
the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each
tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model
coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and
preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark,
ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and
increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time
by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific
processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks. Code

Conclusion: EchoShot可作为通用多镜头视频建模的基础范式。

Abstract: Video diffusion models substantially boost the productivity of artistic
workflows with high-quality portrait video generative capacity. However,
prevailing pipelines are primarily constrained to single-shot creation, while
real-world applications urge for multiple shots with identity consistency and
flexible content controllability. In this work, we propose EchoShot, a native
and scalable multi-shot framework for portrait customization built upon a
foundation video diffusion model. To start with, we propose shot-aware position
embedding mechanisms within video diffusion transformer architecture to model
inter-shot variations and establish intricate correspondence between multi-shot
visual content and their textual descriptions. This simple yet effective design
enables direct training on multi-shot video data without introducing additional
computational overhead. To facilitate model training within multi-shot
scenario, we construct PortraitGala, a large-scale and high-fidelity
human-centric video dataset featuring cross-shot identity consistency and
fine-grained captions such as facial attributes, outfits, and dynamic motions.
To further enhance applicability, we extend EchoShot to perform reference
image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with
infinite shot counts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EchoShot achieves
superior identity consistency as well as attribute-level controllability in
multi-shot portrait video generation. Notably, the proposed framework
demonstrates potential as a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video
modeling.

Method: 比较传统二值化方法与DL模型，引入自定义数据增强技术，并在DIBCO 2019数据集上评估性能。

Result: 数据增强显著提升DL方法性能，二值化质量与作者识别效果强相关。

Conclusion: DL方法结合数据增强在希腊纸草文献的二值化及作者识别中表现优异，为历史文献分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper tackles the task of writer identification for Greek papyri. A
common preprocessing step in writer identification pipelines is image
binarization, which prevents the model from learning background features. This
is challenging in historical documents, in our case Greek papyri, as background
is often non-uniform, fragmented, and discolored with visible fiber structures.
We compare traditional binarization methods to state-of-the-art Deep Learning
(DL) models, evaluating the impact of binarization quality on subsequent writer
identification performance. DL models are trained with and without a custom
data augmentation technique, as well as different model selection criteria are
applied. The performance of these binarization methods, is then systematically
evaluated on the DIBCO 2019 dataset. The impact of binarization on writer
identification is subsequently evaluated using a state-of-the-art approach for
writer identification. The results of this analysis highlight the influence of
data augmentation for DL methods. Furthermore, findings indicate a strong
correlation between binarization effectiveness on papyri documents of DIBCO
2019 and downstream writer identification performance.

*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Ahmad Patooghy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于反馈强化学习和视觉语言模型的新框架，用于保护AI摄像头捕获的敏感视觉信息，将图像转换为语义等效的文本描述，显著提升了隐私保护和文本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAV设备（如AI摄像头）处理隐私敏感数据时存在隐私泄露风险，传统方法（如模糊处理）无法完全保护隐私。

Method: 采用反馈强化学习和视觉语言模型，将图像转换为语义等效文本，并通过分层RL策略迭代优化文本生成。

Result: 相比现有方法，隐私保护和文本质量显著提升，独特词数增加约77%，细节密度提升约50%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了AI摄像头隐私保护问题，同时保留了场景相关信息。

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that
often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a
critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for
applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated
with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for
identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While
traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied
to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals
can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper
introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based
reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect
sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to
convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that
scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A
hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,
enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with
the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by
around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）通过内容无关的空间索引机制解决特征绑定问题，并揭示了绑定错误的根源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型（VLMs）是否采用类似语言模型的符号化机制解决特征绑定问题，以解释其在此类任务中的持续失败。

Method: 识别VLMs中支持绑定的内容无关空间索引机制，并分析绑定错误的来源。

Result: 发现VLMs通过符号化机制实现特征绑定，绑定错误源于这些机制的失效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs中符号化处理机制，为解决其绑定失败问题提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: To accurately process a visual scene, observers must bind features together
to represent individual objects. This capacity is necessary, for instance, to
distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image
containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language
models solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like,
content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are
employed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially
relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding.
Here, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in
VLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that
binding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken
together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like
processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent
binding failures exhibited by these models.

Abstract: Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate and validate PanSegNet, a deep
learning (DL) algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI in children
with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls.
Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T
Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University
(2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients
diagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general
radiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior
pediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance
(HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W
scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)
and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved
DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98
mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86
(controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and
0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 =
0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability.
Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for
pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy
and diseased states. This tool, algorithm, along with our annotated dataset,
are freely available on GitHub and OSF, advancing accessible, radiation-free

Motivation: 传统方法无法完全去除摩尔纹或导致结果过于平滑，生成模型在非线性退化中表现不佳。

Method: 提出混合MAP框架，结合监督学习模型和TFMP先验，前者学习非线性映射，后者优化输出。

Result: 框架结合了线性注意力的计算效率和生成模型的优化能力，提升了恢复性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了去摩尔纹问题，恢复了高频细节并抑制了伪影。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoir\'eing by
integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning
techniques. Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes,
which pose significant challenges for existing methods.
  Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e
patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from
constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately
represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of
ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for
linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing
and often introduce artifacts.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that
integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning
model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT)
modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing.
The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the
outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively
restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two
components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the
refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频同步方法依赖音频或特定视觉事件，限制了通用性；现有基准缺乏可重复性，阻碍了领域发展。

Method: 提出VideoSync框架，不依赖特定特征提取方法，使用新数据集（单人类、多人类、非人类场景）和CNN模型进行同步偏移预测。

Result: VideoSync在公平实验条件下优于现有方法（如SeSyn-Net），并纠正了先前工作中的偏差。

Conclusion: VideoSync提升了视频同步的通用性和鲁棒性，适用于现实应用。

Abstract: Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same
event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show
production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work
has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting
applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or
absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack
generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this
work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates
independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose
estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We
evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human,
multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code
for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals
biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline,
leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a
more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms
existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions.
Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods,
identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most
effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific
constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world
applications.

Motivation: 结合ViTs的全局依赖建模能力和Mamba2的空间邻接先验建模能力，提升视觉任务的性能。

Method: 改进Mamba2的结构化掩码为2D折线路径掩码，并嵌入ViTs的自注意力机制中。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和分割任务中超越现有方法，如ADE20K上PPMA-T/S/B模型mIoU提升0.7%/1.3%/0.3%。

Conclusion: PPMA有效结合了两种架构的优势，显著提升了视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues
of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks.
Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in
computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability
of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its
significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly
modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this
paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the
self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2,
harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we
first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D
polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask,
polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among
image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the
structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an
efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we
embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs,
enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and
segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art
approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our
proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K
semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%,
respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/zhongchenzhao/PPMA.

Motivation: 解决源域和目标域属于完全不同模态时无监督域适应方法的局限性。

Method: 提出LSB框架，采用双分支架构，结合特征一致性损失和域对齐损失。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LSB框架有效解决了跨模态无监督域适应问题。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps
but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely
distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting
called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which
enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by
leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities.
To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a
specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task.
Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature
consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain
alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains.
Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: LBMamba是一种局部双向状态空间模型，通过在正向扫描中嵌入轻量级反向扫描，避免了传统双向扫描的计算开销，提升了效率。基于LBMamba的LBVim在多个视觉任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型因其单向性限制了全局信息获取，传统双向扫描方法虽能解决但计算成本高。LBMamba旨在消除额外扫描，保持高效性。

Method: 提出LBMamba块，在正向选择性扫描中嵌入局部反向扫描，无需额外计算。LBVim通过交替扫描方向恢复全局感受野。

Result: LBVim在ImageNet、ADE20K和COCO等数据集上性能优于基线，病理图像分类任务中AUC、F1和准确率也有显著提升。

Conclusion: LBMamba和LBVim在保持高效的同时显著提升了性能，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting
recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a
linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its
unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous
states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision
methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward
scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a
full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,
eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To
eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM
block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward
selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on
LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan
directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra
backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural
images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers
a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput,
LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K
classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic
segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection
dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance
learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan.
Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method
achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1,
1.67% better accuracy.

Abstract: As the frontline data for cancer diagnosis, microscopic pathology images are
fundamental for providing patients with rapid and accurate treatment. However,
despite their practical value, the deep learning community has largely
overlooked their usage. This paper proposes a novel approach to classifying
microscopy images as time series data, addressing the unique challenges posed
by their manual acquisition and weakly labeled nature. The proposed method fits
image sequences of varying lengths to a fixed-length target by leveraging
Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW). Attention-based pooling is employed to
predict the class of the case simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach by comparing performance with various baselines and showcasing
the benefits of using various inference strategies in achieving stable and
reliable results. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each
component. Our approach contributes to medical image analysis by not only
embracing microscopic images but also lifting them to a trustworthy level of
performance.

Conclusion: SignViP通过多细粒度条件和离散标记化方法显著提升了手语视频生成的质量和表现力。

Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving
sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily
rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the
intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model,
which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos.
To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that
incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity.
Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions,
SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent
fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP
contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly
trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that
encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization
(FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings
into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3)
Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text
to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token
Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete
multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings
by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion
Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP
achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality,
temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at

Motivation: 由于VPR系统在面对对抗攻击时缺乏防御能力，可能导致机器人导航灾难性后果，因此需要研究如何提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 论文分析了四种常见对抗攻击和四种VPR特有攻击，提出了一种结合AAD和导航决策的实验框架，并评估了多种性能指标。

Result: 实验表明，加入AAD后，定位性能显著提升（如沿轨定位误差减少约50%），即使检测准确率仅为75%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了AAD在实际系统中的必要性，并为系统设计提供了量化要求。

Abstract: Stand-alone Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems have little defence
against a well-designed adversarial attack, which can lead to disastrous
consequences when deployed for robot navigation. This paper extensively
analyzes the effect of four adversarial attacks common in other perception
tasks and four novel VPR-specific attacks on VPR localization performance. We
then propose how to close the loop between VPR, an Adversarial Attack Detector
(AAD), and active navigation decisions by demonstrating the performance benefit
of simulated AADs in a novel experiment paradigm -- which we detail for the
robotics community to use as a system framework. In the proposed experiment
paradigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies
can improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement
-- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can
be achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75%
and up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including:
Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an
`Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on
these results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this
work highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy
navigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.

Abstract: Historical geologic maps contain rich geospatial information, such as rock
units, faults, folds, and bedding planes, that is critical for assessing
mineral resources essential to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and
national security. However, digitizing maps remains a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task. We present DIGMAPPER, a modular, scalable system developed
in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to automate
the digitization of geologic maps. DIGMAPPER features a fully dockerized,
workflow-orchestrated architecture that integrates state-of-the-art deep
learning models for map layout analysis, feature extraction, and
georeferencing. To overcome challenges such as limited training data and
complex visual content, our system employs innovative techniques, including
in-context learning with large language models, synthetic data generation, and
transformer-based models. Evaluations on over 100 annotated maps from the
DARPA-USGS dataset demonstrate high accuracy across polygon, line, and point

Motivation: 内窥镜场景中的光照变化和稀疏纹理对深度估计和自运动估计提出了挑战，现有方法需要更有效的训练策略。

Method: 采用三步训练策略：光流注册、多尺度图像分解和多变换对齐，每步仅训练相关网络以减少信息干扰。

Result: 在SCARED和Hamlyn数据集上实现了4%~10%的误差降低，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 多步微调框架显著提升了内窥镜场景下的自监督深度估计性能。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation and ego-motion estimation are significant tasks
for scene perception and navigation in stable, accurate and efficient
robot-assisted endoscopy. To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in
endoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow
and intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing
methods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are
still critical to deal with both illumination issues and information
interference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a
novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work.
In each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps,
including optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and
multiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are
trained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on
parameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on
SCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with
4\%$\sim$10\% lower error. The evaluation code of this work has been published

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉生成中注意力机制的高计算和内存成本问题，尤其是在高分辨率图像或多帧视频生成中。

Method: 设计了一种Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)技术，将分散的注意力模式统一为硬件友好的块状模式，简化并增强了稀疏化和量化。

Result: PAROAttention在低密度（20%-30%）和低比特宽度（INT8/INT4）下实现了与全精度基线几乎相同的性能，端到端延迟加速了1.9x至2.7x。

Conclusion: PARO技术通过重组注意力模式，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了视觉生成的高质量。

Abstract: In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms
results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token
sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To
address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and
quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low
density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that
the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of
visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized
sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose
an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the
challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature
extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**
technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a
hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies
and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the
performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a
methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,
achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical
results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower
density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to
**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试集无法充分衡量模型对开放词汇概念的理解，因其语义空间与训练集相似。

Method: 提出OVSNet，通过异构特征融合和训练空间扩展提升性能。

Result: OVSNet在现有数据集和OpenBench上均取得最佳结果。

Conclusion: OpenBench和OVSNet的有效性得到验证，为开放词汇分割提供新方向。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary
categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent
works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the
potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made
significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing
test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of
``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the
training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present
a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training
semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand
and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods
on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions
drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to
improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through
elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the
training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing
datasets and our proposed OpenBench. Corresponding analysis demonstrate the
soundness and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark and method.

TL;DR: STAR-Pose是一种针对低分辨率视频中人体姿态估计的空间-时间自适应超分辨率框架，通过新型Transformer和自适应融合模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低分辨率视频中的人体姿态估计存在挑战，传统方法要么依赖高质量输入，要么计算成本高，难以在资源受限环境中部署。

Method: 提出STAR-Pose框架，结合空间-时间Transformer和自适应融合模块，设计任务导向的复合损失函数。

Result: 在多个主流数据集上表现优异，低分辨率条件下mAP提升5.2%，推理速度比级联方法快2.8x至4.4x。

Conclusion: STAR-Pose在低分辨率视频中高效且准确地实现了人体姿态估计，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos presents a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods either assume high-quality
inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits
their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a
spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for
video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal
Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently
captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an
adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture
enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented
super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural
features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than
optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several
mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing
approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely
low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster
inference than cascaded approaches.

Method: 提出TD3Net，结合密集跳跃连接和多扩张时间卷积，覆盖更广且无盲区的感受野。

Result: 在两个大型公开数据集上表现优异，参数和计算量更少，准确率更高。

Conclusion: TD3Net有效利用多样化时间特征，保持时间连续性，在唇读系统中具有显著优势。

Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework
with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip
movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend
architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted
in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been
introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,
thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,
their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss
regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the
receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal
densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip
connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend
architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind
spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.
Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly
available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that
the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower
floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.
Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes
diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting
notable advantages in lipreading systems. The code is available at our GitHub

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法隐式学习事件位置和语义，依赖大量训练数据且性能受限。

Method: 引入位置锚定查询和事件关系编码器，显式注入位置和关系先验。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook2数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 显式先验显著提升密集视频描述任务的性能。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging task that aims to localize and
caption multiple events in an untrimmed video. Recent studies mainly follow the
transformer-based architecture to jointly perform the two sub-tasks, i.e.,
event localization and caption generation, in an end-to-end manner. Based on
the general philosophy of detection transformer, these methods implicitly learn
the event locations and event semantics, which requires a large amount of
training data and limits the model's performance in practice. In this paper, we
propose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects
the explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to
improve the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the
one hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the
scene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as
position prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate
the implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event
relation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event
boundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the
semantic coherence of the captions. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of the position and relation prior. Experimental
results also show the competitive performance of our method on ActivityNet
Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

TL;DR: AutoV是一种自动选择最优视觉提示的方法，通过训练模型从多个候选提示中选择最佳选项，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计视觉提示耗时且效果有限，无法充分利用不同提示的潜力，因此需要一种自动化的方法来优化提示选择。

Method: 提出AutoV，通过自动数据收集和标注流程，利用预训练的LVLM评估和排名视觉提示，训练模型自动选择最优提示。

Result: 实验表明，AutoV显著提升了多种LVLM的性能，例如LLaVA-OV和Qwen2.5-VL在多个任务中准确率分别提高了1.7%和1.9%。

Conclusion: AutoV作为一种自动视觉提示方法，具有潜力成为LVLM的最优提示选择工具。

Abstract: Inspired by text prompts in large language models (LLMs), visual prompts have
been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language
models (LVLMs). Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as
overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image.
However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and
time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual
prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose
\textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt
from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To
train AutoV, we developed an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline
that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set
of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction
losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we
train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various
visual prompts for LVLMs. Experimental results indicate that AutoV enhances the
performance of various LVLMs across multiple popular image understanding tasks.
For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{1.7}\%$ accuracy gain on
LLaVA$^{\text{Wild}}$, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{1.9}\%$ on MMMU,
highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method for LVLMs.

TL;DR: FastInit提出了一种快速噪声初始化方法，通过单次前向传播生成高质量视频噪声，显著提升视频生成的效率和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如FreeInit通过迭代优化噪声提高了时序一致性，但计算成本高，FastInit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FastInit训练了一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），输入随机噪声和文本提示，单次生成优化后的噪声。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit显著提升了生成视频的质量和时序一致性，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，可直接应用于推理阶段。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Result: 在多种泛化场景（如未见对象组合、任务和数量）中表现优于神经和神经符号基线。

Conclusion: DeepObjectLog通过神经符号方法有效学习对象中心表示，提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Relational learning enables models to generalize across structured domains by
reasoning over objects and their interactions. While recent advances in
neurosymbolic reasoning and object-centric learning bring us closer to this
goal, existing systems rely either on object-level supervision or on a
predefined decomposition of the input into objects. In this work, we propose a
neurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly
from raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We
instantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that
integrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations,
with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By
enabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component
introduces a novel learning signal that further guides the discovery of
meaningful objects in the input. We evaluate our model across a diverse range
of generalization settings, including unseen object compositions, unseen tasks,
and unseen number of objects. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines across the tested settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO）在MLLMs中的适应性和评估不足，尤其是推理步骤与答案的逻辑一致性。

Method: 提出GRPO-CARE框架，结合基础答案正确性奖励和自适应一致性奖励，替代KL惩罚，优化推理路径。

Result: GRPO-CARE在SEED-Bench-R1上性能提升6.7%，一致性提高24.5%，并展示出强迁移能力。

Conclusion: GRPO-CARE为MLLMs的后训练提供了可推广的框架，推动了更可解释和鲁棒的模型发展。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO,
have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack
of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce
SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced
perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates
generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,
cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,
we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces
logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%
consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final
answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To
address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing
both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.
GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer
correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the
model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)
against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths
that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with
this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,
achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%
improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving
model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work
contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable
post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and
robust MLLMs.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation
in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and
broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive
performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains
largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored
adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly
when directly applied to RES, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its
multimodal structure. Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users
typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the
same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize
across varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we
propose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \textbf{Multimodal
Bidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models. Our method introduces learnable
proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly performs visual-aligned
optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the
textual modality during attack generation. This dual optimization framework
encourages adversarial images to actively adapt to more challenging text
embedding during optimization, thereby enhancing their cross-text
transferability, which refers to the ability of adversarial examples to remain
effective under a variety of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple RES models and benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: Multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) for multi-task remote
physiological measurement seeks to enhance the generalizability of these
metrics and attracts increasing attention. However, challenges like partial
labeling and environmental noise may disrupt task-specific accuracy. Meanwhile,
given that real-time adaptation is necessary for personalized products, the
test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) after MSSDG is also worth exploring,
while the gap between previous generalization and personalization methods is
significant and hard to fuse. Thus, we proposed a unified framework for
MSSD\textbf{G} and TTP\textbf{A} employing \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GAP}) in
biometrics and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). We first disentangled
information from face videos into invariant semantics, individual bias, and
noise. Then, multiple modules incorporating priors and our observations were
applied in different stages and for different facial information. Then, based
on the different principles of achieving generalization and personalization,
our framework could simultaneously address MSSDG and TTPA under multi-task
remote physiological estimation with minimal adjustments. We expanded the MSSDG
benchmark to the TTPA protocol on six publicly available datasets and
introduced a new real-world driving dataset with complete labeling. Extensive
experiments that validated our approach, and the codes along with the new
dataset will be released.

Abstract: Accident detection using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage is one of
the most imperative features for enhancing transport safety and efficient
traffic control. To this end, this research addresses the issues of supervised
monitoring and data deficiency in accident detection systems by adapting
excellent deep learning technologies. The motivation arises from rising
statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation
and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying
accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the
scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model
training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from
YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image
normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned
Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best
for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%,
while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework
suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection
capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for
intelligent surveillance systems in the future for real-time traffic
monitoring, smart city framework, and integration of intelligent surveillance
systems into emergency management systems.

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of
increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven,
rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle
these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex,
multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye
view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories
that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end,
we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as
training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of
traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object
detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN
architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to
diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training,
with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the
proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic
parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset.

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful
approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while
preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a
trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world
scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different
clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap,
we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework,
which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts,
local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of
prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which
adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization.
Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients,
i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by
semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized
heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

*Weeyoung Kwon,Jeahun Sung,Minkyu Jeon,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文综述了3D低层视觉（3D LLV）领域，探讨了如何在退化条件下实现高保真3D重建，并提出了相关挑战和方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）假设输入为干净高分辨率图像，无法应对现实中的噪声、模糊等退化问题，因此需要研究3D LLV以提升鲁棒性。

Method: 通过形式化退化感知渲染问题，分类整合低层视觉任务的神经渲染方法，并讨论时空一致性和病态优化等关键挑战。

Result: 综述了代表性方法、数据集和评估协议，展示了3D LLV在自动驾驶、AR/VR等领域的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 3D LLV是实现现实环境中鲁棒3D内容生成和场景重建的重要方向。

Abstract: Neural rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved significant progress in photorealistic
3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing models
assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their
robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution
(LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging
field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision
tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal,
restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred
to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust
rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the
degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to
spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that
integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate
how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions.
Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also
discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By
reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work
positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation
and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

*Zhaoyi Wang,Jemil Avers Butt,Shengyu Huang,Tomislav Medic,Andreas Wieser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云和RGB图像融合的分层分区方法，用于估计密集3D位移矢量场，显著提高了空间覆盖率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅依赖几何或辐射信息，导致稀疏或非3D位移估计，无法满足滑坡监测需求。

Method: 采用分层分区粗到细的方法，结合3D几何和2D图像特征构建匹配，并通过几何一致性检查和刚性变换估计进行优化。

Result: 在两个真实滑坡数据集上，空间覆盖率达79%和97%，位移幅度偏差分别为0.15m和0.25m，优于现有方法F2S3。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于TLS的滑坡监测提供了实用且适应性强的解决方案，并可扩展至其他点云和监测任务。

Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating
associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on
either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D
displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and
co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We
construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.
These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid
transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world
landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement
estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.
Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements
(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,
respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived
references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and
0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial
coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical
and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to
other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. Our example data and source
code are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyiww/fusion4landslide.

*Xin Jiang,Meiqi Cao,Hao Tang,Fei Shen,Zechao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双视觉适应（DVA）方法，通过样本和特征协作适应，解决了细粒度图像检索（FGIR）中预训练模型过拟合和泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FGIR方法容易过拟合训练数据，忽视预训练知识，导致泛化能力下降。

Method: 设计了对象感知适应和上下文适应，分别调整输入样本和特征，同时提出判别感知迁移以平衡检索效率和性能。

Result: 在三个分布内和三个分布外细粒度数据集上表现优异，且参数较少。

Conclusion: DVA方法有效提升了FGIR任务的性能，同时保持了预训练模型的优势。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning
discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar
fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two
regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding
space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model.
However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting
the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their
generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation
(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform
FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we
design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the
pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that
are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context
Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation
without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using
these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.
Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose
Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in
the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge
distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable
parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three
out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.

TL;DR: SyncMapV2是一种无监督分割算法，具有卓越的鲁棒性，无需训练或监督，且能在线适应输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视觉在无显式训练下仍能稳健分割视觉线索，而现有AI算法在噪声增加时表现不佳。SyncMapV2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于自组织动力学方程和随机网络概念，无需鲁棒训练或损失函数，支持在线适应。

Result: 在数字噪声、天气和模糊等干扰下，SyncMapV2性能下降极小（0.01%），远超现有方法（下降23.8%）。

Conclusion: SyncMapV2展示了无监督、自适应分割的潜力，为未来鲁棒智能算法的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit
training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In
contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar
conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised
segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal
drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop
observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types
of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%
vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training,
supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses
self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random
networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization
for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous
adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust
results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online,
adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2
demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a
new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定单输入单输出的Unet架构，忽略了像素级多尺度表示，且对高、低频噪声特性处理不足。

Method: 使用图像金字塔输入，设计ASFU单元通过可学习掩模分离高、低频信息，并在跳跃连接中引入全局特征融合块。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声图像数据集上的实验验证了MADNet优于当前最先进的去噪方法。

Conclusion: MADNet通过多尺度自适应和双域学习显著提升了图像去噪性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated
exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing
architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet
architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In
addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the
different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for
image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from
low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency
and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning
unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into
high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design
a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify
the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising
approaches.

multi-modal synthetic dataset for autonomous driving that not only supports
popular 2D computer vision applications but also their LiDAR counterparts,
providing fine-grained annotations for up to 64 classes. We extensively

Result: 实验证明DETA++在噪声环境下表现出色，具有较高的灵活性和有效性。

Conclusion: DETA++通过去噪和鲁棒性增强策略，显著提升了小样本学习在开放世界中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in model pre-training give rise to task adaptation-based
few-shot learning (FSL), where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic
model for capturing task-specific knowledge with a few-labeled support samples
of the target task.Nevertheless, existing approaches may still fail in the open
world due to the inevitable in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
noise from both support and query samples of the target task. With limited
support samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be
severely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can
produce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual
noises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable
FSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate
image and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype
loss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust
task adaptation. Additionally,DETA++ employs a memory bank to store and refine
clean regions for each inner-task class, based on which a Local Nearest
Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) is devised to yield noise-robust predictions on
query samples. Moreover, DETA++ utilizes an Intra-class Region Swapping
(IntraSwap) strategy to rectify ID class prototypes during task adaptation,
enhancing the model's robustness to the dual noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++.

Result: 像素级显著性图优于点特异性显著性图，适合支持法医专家。

Conclusion: 像素级显著性图在笔迹识别和验证中表现更优，有助于法医专家的分析。

Abstract: Neural Networks are the state of the art for many tasks in the computer
vision domain, including Writer Identification (WI) and Writer Verification
(WV). The transparency of these "black box" systems is important for
improvements of performance and reliability. For this work, two transparency
techniques are applied to neural networks trained on WI and WV for the first
time in this domain. The first technique provides pixel-level saliency maps,
while the point-specific saliency maps of the second technique provide
information on similarities between two images. The transparency techniques are
evaluated using deletion and insertion score metrics. The goal is to support
forensic experts with information on similarities in handwritten text and to
explore the characteristics selected by a neural network for the identification
process. For the qualitative evaluation, the highlights of the maps are
compared to the areas forensic experts consider during the identification
process. The evaluation results show that the pixel-wise saliency maps
outperform the point-specific saliency maps and are suitable for the support of
forensic experts.

Conclusion: MambaHash在大规模图像检索任务中表现出高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Deep image hashing aims to enable effective large-scale image retrieval by
mapping the input images into simple binary hash codes through deep neural
networks. More recently, Vision Mamba with linear time complexity has attracted
extensive attention from researchers by achieving outstanding performance on
various computer tasks. Nevertheless, the suitability of Mamba for large-scale
image retrieval tasks still needs to be explored. Towards this end, we propose
a visual state space hashing model, called MambaHash. Concretely, we propose a
backbone network with stage-wise architecture, in which grouped Mamba operation
is introduced to model local and global information by utilizing Mamba to
perform multi-directional scanning along different groups of the channel.
Subsequently, the proposed channel interaction attention module is used to
enhance information communication across channels. Finally, we meticulously
design an adaptive feature enhancement module to increase feature diversity and
enhance the visual representation capability of the model. We have conducted
comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and
IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the
state-of-the-art deep hashing methods, our proposed MambaHash has well
efficiency and superior performance to effectively accomplish large-scale image
retrieval tasks. Source code is available

Motivation: Vision Transformers在医学图像处理中因高计算需求受限，需一种方法减少无关标记的处理。

Method: 使用提示引导的空间先验对标记进行排序，剪枝低相关性标记，仅保留相关标记进行后续处理。

Result: 实验显示减少了35-55%的标记，降低了计算成本，同时保持了分割准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境中实现了高效、实时的医学图像处理。

Abstract: The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs), in processing a
huge number of tokens, often constrain their practical application in analyzing
medical images. This research proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method
to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation
pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to
their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring
that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent
stages. This data-driven pruning strategy facilitates end-to-end training,
maintains gradient flow, and improves segmentation accuracy by focusing
computational resources on essential regions. The proposed framework is
integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination
of irrelevant tokens; thereby, enhancing computational efficiency while
preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of
$\sim$ 35-55\% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to the
baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework,
facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: AGC-Drive为空中-地面协同感知提供了基准和工具，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps
autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception
accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial
perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to
alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major
reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground
collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first
large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The
data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five
cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and
a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception.
Consisting of approximately 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images, the dataset
covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts,
highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic
interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane
changes. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and
fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide
benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative
perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we
release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification
tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation
utilities. The dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: 结果表明该方法具有潜力，但也揭示了将视觉语言模型（如CLIP）完全适配于微手势识别的难度。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to
the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement
amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based
architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP
model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG
integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition
pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal
fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These
results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining
difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture
recognition.

Conclusion: 双曲空间能有效建模WSI的语义层次，结合跨模态对齐和层次一致性损失，显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning
(MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural
hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic
associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for
improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which
struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we
propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual
descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in
hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts
both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language
foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality
Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic
Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through
entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence.
The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the
similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This
eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware
approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting
the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU
models. Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios,
incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across
both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation
budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.
  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and
six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound
perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance
degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations
outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies
further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and
adversarial transferability.

Motivation: 评估信号处理变换在CNN中的计算效率、能耗和分类准确性之间的权衡。

Method: 在ResNet50中集成FFT、WHT和DCT，使用CIFAR-100数据集进行实验。

Result: WHT显著降低能耗（从25,606 kJ降至39 kJ），同时提高准确率（从66%提升至79%）。

Conclusion: WHT是一种高效且有效的方法，适用于能耗受限的CNN应用。

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations
-- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network
(CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the
trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and
classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100
dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that
incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving
accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy
of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified
ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74%
accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late
layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ
per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient
and effective approach for energy-constrained CNN applications.

Method: 通过基准测试CNN模型在两个数据集（包括一个新收集的数据集）上的表现，分析其对不同采集源和换脸算法的泛化能力。

Result: CNN模型在同一数据源下表现优异，但在跨数据集时难以鲁棒地捕捉遮挡相关的视觉线索。

Conclusion: 需要开发专门的检测策略以应对换脸操作中的视觉伪影。

Abstract: Face swapping manipulations in video streams represents an increasing threat
in remote video communications, due to advances
  in automated and real-time tools. Recent literature proposes to characterize
and exploit visual artifacts introduced in video frames
  by swapping algorithms when dealing with challenging physical scenes, such as
face occlusions. This paper investigates the
  effectiveness of this approach by benchmarking CNN-based data-driven models
on two data corpora (including a newly collected
  one) and analyzing generalization capabilities with respect to different
acquisition sources and swapping algorithms. The results
  confirm excellent performance of general-purpose CNN architectures when
operating within the same data source, but a significant
  difficulty in robustly characterizing occlusion-based visual cues across
datasets. This highlights the need for specialized detection
  strategies to deal with such artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究降雪对3D物体检测性能的影响，但现有数据集缺乏足够的雪天和晴天配对数据，或依赖不真实的合成数据。

Method: 通过扩展加拿大恶劣驾驶条件数据集（CADC），创建CADC+，将雪天序列与同路段、同时间的晴天序列配对，减少非雪因素引起的域偏移。

Result: 初步结果显示，降雪同时引入了随机性和认知不确定性，既表现为噪声，又作为独立的数据域。

Conclusion: CADC+为研究雪天对3D物体检测的影响提供了更真实的数据基础，揭示了降雪对检测性能的双重影响。

Abstract: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection performance remains
underexplored. Conducting such an evaluation requires a dataset with sufficient
labelled data from both weather conditions, ideally captured in the same
driving environment. Current driving datasets with LiDAR point clouds either do
not provide enough labelled data in both snowy and clear weather conditions, or
rely on de-snowing methods to generate synthetic clear weather. Synthetic data
often lacks realism and introduces an additional domain shift that confounds
accurate evaluations. To address these challenges, we present CADC+, the first
paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter
conditions. CADC+ extends the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset
(CADC) using clear weather data that was recorded on the same roads and in the
same period as CADC. To create CADC+, we pair each CADC sequence with a clear
weather sequence that matches the snowy sequence as closely as possible. CADC+
thus minimizes the domain shift resulting from factors unrelated to the
presence of snow. We also present some preliminary results using CADC+ to
evaluate the effect of snow on 3D object detection performance. We observe that
snow introduces a combination of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting
as both noise and a distinct data domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业图像中密集、自遮挡对象的实例分割问题，减少标注需求。

Method: 设计GLMask图像-掩码表示，关注形状、纹理和模式；通过语义分割生成实例分割。

Result: 在小麦头部实例分割上达到98.5% mAP@50，在COCO数据集上提升12.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于农业，还可推广到其他类似数据特征的领域。

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated
monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is
required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each
object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the
use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in
images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in
agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised
learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a
high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask
representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while
minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate
semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.
The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance
segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance
segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed
methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a
significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that
the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and
applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

TL;DR: SafeTriage是一种新方法，通过去识别化患者面部视频保留关键运动特征，解决AI模型在卒中分诊中的隐私和伦理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型依赖真实患者数据带来的隐私和伦理挑战，同时确保卒中诊断的准确性。

Method: 使用预训练视频运动转移模型将患者面部运动特征映射到合成身份上，并引入条件生成模型调整输入空间。

Result: 合成视频有效保留卒中相关面部模式，提供可靠的AI分诊，同时确保隐私保护。

Conclusion: SafeTriage为神经疾病数据共享和AI临床分析提供了安全、伦理合规的基础。

Abstract: Effective stroke triage in emergency settings often relies on clinicians'
ability to identify subtle abnormalities in facial muscle coordination. While
recent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient
facial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical
and privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable
models across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a
novel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving
essential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a
pretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics
of real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains
diagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'
identities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population
pre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a
conditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input
space of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to
fine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including
quantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that
SafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant
facial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show
that SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and
AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性评估指标忽略空间上下文和解剖结构，导致对定性不同模式（如分散与边界对齐的不确定性）评分相同。

Method: 提出三种结合结构和边界信息的空间感知指标，并在前列腺分区分割挑战数据上验证。

Result: 新指标与临床重要因素更一致，能更好区分有意义和虚假的不确定性模式。

Conclusion: 空间感知指标在医学图像分割中更有效，能提供更可靠的不确定性评估。

Abstract: Uncertainty maps highlight unreliable regions in segmentation predictions.
However, most uncertainty evaluation metrics treat voxels independently,
ignoring spatial context and anatomical structure. As a result, they may assign
identical scores to qualitatively distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs.
boundary-aligned uncertainty). We propose three spatially aware metrics that
incorporate structural and boundary information and conduct a thorough
validation on medical imaging data from the prostate zonal segmentation
challenge within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Our results demonstrate
improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination
between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

Motivation: 当前框架在非结构化环境中表现不佳，且无法适应不同机器人类型，需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 结合自然语言提示和人类操作员辅助，采用零样本学习，无需大量数据收集或重新训练。

Result: 在多个数据集和机器人平台上验证，性能优于GA-NAV和Off-seg。

Conclusion: AnyTraverse提供了一种车辆无关的越野可通行性方法，平衡自动化与针对性人类监督。

Abstract: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with
applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration,
and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in
unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to
be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework
combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to
determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments
scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering
previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its
region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to
varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for
extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes
testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate
real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that
AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a
vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation
with targeted human supervision.

Motivation: 解决图像质量评估中主观性和复杂失真的挑战。

Method: 结合质量感知预训练CNN、质量感知损失函数和元学习器集成多个基模型。

Result: 在LiveCD、KonIQ-10K和BIQ2021数据集上表现优异，PLCC和SROCC分数显著高于现有方法。

Conclusion: MetaQAP为无参考IQA提供了鲁棒且可推广的框架，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of
applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human
perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study
proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these
challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The
model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss
function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an
ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models.
Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD,
KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional
performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman
Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD,
0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing
IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the
generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721
to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The
ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing
substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the
meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only
addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a
robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing
the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable
insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.

Method: 提出无偏的圆形图案投影模型，引入不确定性以优化校准的各个组件（如模式检测、优化和评估指标），并基于马尔可夫随机场建模二维形状的边界点。

Result: 新框架显著提高了校准的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过无偏投影模型和不确定性定义，论文实现了更精确和鲁棒的相机校准，并提供了相关指南和开源代码。

Abstract: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two
types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the
corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is
derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise
measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of
circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance.
To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the
circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the
checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular
patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid
uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including
pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide
guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation
metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a
two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity.
The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an
appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the
resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and
robustness. The complete source code and demonstration video are available at

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation

on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy

generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable
tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions,
RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman
filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition,
RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale
using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern

different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed
as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models
with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable
knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of
utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,
which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework
designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.
Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the
multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.
Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant
models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene
approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and
comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG
requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8
times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training
and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient
deployment across diverse downstream tasks.

TL;DR: Part$^{2}$GS是一个用于建模多部分物体高保真几何和物理一致运动的框架，通过部分感知的3D高斯表示和物理约束实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的关节物体建模仍具挑战性，现有方法难以兼顾高保真几何和物理一致性。

Method: 采用部分感知3D高斯表示，结合物理约束（接触、速度、向量场对齐）和排斥点场防止碰撞。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，Part$^{2}$GS在可移动部分的Chamfer距离上优于现有方法10倍。

Conclusion: Part$^{2}$GS为关节物体的高保真建模和物理一致运动提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their
structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods.
In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling
articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and
physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D
Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable
attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve
high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a
motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,
including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part
collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving
motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable
parts.

Result: 高质量标注提升文本对齐但可能降低美学和多样性；随机长度标注能平衡美学与对齐；标注分布影响模型输出偏差。

Conclusion: 标注设计对模型性能至关重要，研究为文本到图像生成提供了更有效的训练数据策略。

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The
quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance.
Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works
shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally
believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide
any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by
systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies
impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments
demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may
introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions
of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and
alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that
varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias
of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in
achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more
effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point
trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and
benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a
scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the
scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified
next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion
simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between
closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable
long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in
short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other
methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体深度估计在自动驾驶和机器人技术中至关重要，但其易受对抗攻击。现有方法在物理世界中效果不佳，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过引入条纹结构（在重复纹理中加入间隔），并联合优化条纹结构和纹理元素，生成对抗补丁。

Result: 生成的补丁能有效攻击主流立体深度估计方法（如RAFT-Stereo和STTR）及商用RGB-D相机（Intel RealSense）。

Conclusion: 条纹结构显著提升了对抗补丁的物理世界攻击效果，为立体系统的安全评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Stereo Depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and
robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant)
can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth
estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous work has
shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth
estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these
naively repeated texture structures perform poorly in physical-world
implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical
utility for testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the
first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals between repeated
textures, creating a striped structure, significantly enhances the patch attack
effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of
this novel structure influence the performance. Based on these insights, we
develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the striped
structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be
inserted into any scenes and successfully attack state-of-the-art stereo depth
estimation methods, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can
also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world
conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of
stereo systems.

TL;DR: LaVi提出了一种新型大型视觉语言模型，通过内部特征调制实现高效视觉语言融合，显著提升性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在视觉语言集成上效率低下，限制了可扩展性和效率。

Method: LaVi通过轻量级自适应变换，将视觉条件化的增量注入层归一化的仿射参数中，避免长上下文扩展。

Result: 在15个图像和视频基准测试中，LaVi实现了最先进的多模态性能，FLOPs减少94.0%，推理速度提升3.1倍，内存使用减半。

Conclusion: LaVi是一种可扩展且实用的实时多模态推理解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient
visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's
inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden,
severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink
multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and
efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token
concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a
lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by
injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of
layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states
based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while
preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational
costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate
that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also
dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs
by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half
- establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time
multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用语言模型中丰富的常识先验（如场景上下文），而这些先验对人类理解对象、交互和活动至关重要。

Method: 1. 视频上下文总结组件生成候选对象、活动及交互；2. 描述生成模块通过辅助提示和常识推理描述场景并推断后续活动；3. 多模态活动识别头结合视觉和文本线索识别动作。

Conclusion: 结合语言驱动的常识先验能显著提升复杂视频动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by
adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain.
However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts
that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object
interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this
paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense
priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that
are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component
that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between
objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the
current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through
auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity
recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video
actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
Action Genome and Charades datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法通过决策边界增强和亲和力检索，显著提升了FSGCD任务的性能。

Abstract: While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved
significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small
number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming
to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known
information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary
enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed
to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these
boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary
pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on
known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries
using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided
decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further
enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved
pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown
clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on
six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting. The codes are available at:

Motivation: 当前文本引导的红外与可见光图像融合方法对文本语义信息的利用不足，限制了融合效果和下游任务性能。

Result: 实验表明，TeSG在下游任务（如检测和分割）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TeSG通过多级文本语义引导，显著提升了红外与可见光图像融合的效果和实用性。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to combine complementary
information from both image modalities, producing more informative and
comprehensive outputs. Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due
to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and
utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask
semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual
descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on
this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image
fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is
optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.
Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information
Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven
Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics
based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based
fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask
semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated
attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on
downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 提出3DeepRep模型，通过三个方向的深度非线性变换和核范数最小化，结合可学习的聚合模块，以自监督方式优化。

Result: 在真实HSI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 3DeepRep模型通过全面利用张量模式的低秩特性，显著提升了高光谱图像修复的效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have
demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by
leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments
incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however,
existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode,
neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep)
model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the
HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of
mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction
(i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the
three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation
module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization
algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner.
Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上，CoDAF达到了78.6%的mAP，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CoDAF通过统一设计解决了弱对齐问题，显著提升了无人机多模态目标检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in
applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve
robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible
(RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and
asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between
modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges:
semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict
during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in
isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal
Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that
jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection.
CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA),
which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution
guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the
Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances
modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via
spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a
unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on
standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF
achieving a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset.

Abstract: In medical imaging, AI decision-support systems must balance accuracy and
interpretability to build user trust and support effective clinical
decision-making. Recently, Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) and its
variants have emerged as interpretable-by-design modeling techniques, aiming to
explain AI decisions in terms of human-understandable, clinically relevant
concepts. However, existing V-IP methods overlook instance-level uncertainties
in query-answer generation, which can arise from model limitations (epistemic
uncertainty) or variability in expert responses (aleatoric uncertainty).
  This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a novel framework that
integrates uncertainty quantification into the V-IP process. We evaluate UAV-IP
across four medical imaging datasets, PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, and SkinCon,
demonstrating an average AUC improvement of approximately 3.2% while generating
20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP, without sacrificing
informativeness. These findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware
reasoning in interpretable by design models for robust and reliable medical
decision-making.

Abstract: With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the
advancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has
significantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information
security. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models,
diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective
countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising
to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this
problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different
diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images.
Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention
(NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To
implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer,
forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a
cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a
channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When
encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the
state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at

Conclusion: 分层分解方法有效解决了对象嵌入和遮挡问题，适用于已知和未知对象类别。

Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image
retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of
effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly
supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor
performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the
feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region
discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical
fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature
subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the
various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The
hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and
occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features
derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation
for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains
effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on
three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods considerably.

Abstract: Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both
modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual
or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based
on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method
parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly
represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the
traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized
spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs,
and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both
modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple
loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused
image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation
information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the
visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of
INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and
achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate
queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing
methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics,
producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich
information without the necessity for a training dataset.

Conclusion: PQCAD-DM通过混合压缩框架显著提升了扩散模型的效率，同时保持了生成质量，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and
resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes,
leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive
compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid
compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and
Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs
a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a
momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in
low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during
distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even
with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between
computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while
maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's
superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets,
outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced
methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation
from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have
revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance
segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive
dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual
annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal
approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.
  To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first
publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI
volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020
benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline
framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric
medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various
text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach
demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy,
offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

Method: 提出VLCoT框架模拟人类处理退化图像的过程，结合GRPO优化方法，设计四种奖励函数。

Result: 实验证明RealSR-R1能生成真实细节并准确理解图像内容，尤其在语义丰富或严重退化场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: VLCoT-GRPO框架有效提升了真实世界图像超分辨率的性能，生成结果更自然且高保真。

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in
image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate
understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that
are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which
empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models
(LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose
the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The
framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating
more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge
of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world
scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO
as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to
standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate
degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the
generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual
expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model
to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand
image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe
degradation.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can
produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually
indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors
have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which
limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to
overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really
matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on
identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative
architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize
a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative
architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are
unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a
novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet
decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model
to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves
the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for
complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic
generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a
single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of
other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant
accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent
results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and
data will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 研究人类共视性识别能力在稀疏图像条件下的表现，并评估当前视觉模型是否达到人类水平。

Method: 引入Co-VisiON基准测试，覆盖1000多个室内场景，比较现有视觉模型与人类表现，并提出多视图基线模型Covis。

Result: 专有视觉语言模型表现最佳，但所有模型均远低于人类水平；Covis在纯视觉模型中表现最优。

Conclusion: 共视性推理需要高层次多视图空间理解，Covis缩小了与专有模型的差距，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the
overlapping regions visible in multiple images-even when these images are
sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This capability is foundational in
3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision
learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached
human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce
the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly
evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor
scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated
as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for
existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary
vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all
models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the
need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a
comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across
multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel
multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision
models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and
findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of
robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments. Our dataset

TL;DR: FOCUS是一个统一的LVLM模型，集成了分割感知和可控对象生成，通过端到端框架提升视觉理解和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法将视觉理解和编辑分离，依赖多个独立模型，无法统一处理。

Method: 采用双分支视觉编码器捕获全局和局部信息，结合MoVQGAN视觉分词器和多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在多项任务中表现优异，实现了视觉感知与生成能力的联合优化。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过统一框架有效解决了视觉理解和生成的分割问题。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising
capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling
both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current
approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either
perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as
conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple
disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM
that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric
generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual
encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained
spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to
produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable
accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage
training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as
spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns
visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging
segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive
experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding,
referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate
that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception
and generative capabilities.

Conclusion: Loupe的补丁级融合和条件查询设计有效提升了分类和定位性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about
visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target
either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some
achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across
manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and
localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation
module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity
classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against
distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided
test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to
supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset
demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the
first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge
with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both
classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery
patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/Loupe.

Motivation: 在动态和挑战性环境中（如RoboCup户外场地），传统监督方法需要大量手动标注，成本高且耗时。

Method: 利用预训练模型生成伪标签，通过自监督任务（如着色、边缘检测和三元组损失）学习鲁棒视觉特征，并结合MAML策略快速适应新场景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性、F1分数和IoU上优于基线模型，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 自监督学习框架有效提升了球检测性能，减少了标注需求，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous
humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments
such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches
require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To
overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for
domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The
proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate
pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks
-- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust
visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid
adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset
comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is
introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms
baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting
faster convergence.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注局部面部替换，忽略了整体头部形态，且无法在替换后修改表情。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用统一潜在扩散范式，包括身份保留上下文融合和表情感知地标重定向与编辑模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在背景无缝融合和身份保留方面表现出色，同时具备优越的表情转移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在视频头部替换中实现了更高的精确度和可控性，适用于真实和虚拟角色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based multi-condition
controllable framework for video head swapping, which seamlessly transplant a
human head from a static image into a dynamic video, while preserving the
original body and background of target video, and further allowing to tweak
head expressions and movements during swapping as needed. Existing
face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting
holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with
hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow
users to modify the transplanted head expressions after swapping. To tackle
these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through
a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We
propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground
head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair
enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation
across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark
retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting
module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the
impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression
editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to
minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in seamless background
integration while preserving the identity of the source portrait, as well as
showcasing superior expression transfer capabilities applicable to both real
and virtual characters.

Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems,
particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is
required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with
environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes,
human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit
modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based
end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert
demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images,
goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It
outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and
gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with
target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling
dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both
vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a
high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of
0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further
demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and
goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at:

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限领域具有广泛适用性，为有限样本多模态学习提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks
requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of
paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to
obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building
multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained
unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible
with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than
$1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce
STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the
neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally,
we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the
benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity
across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into
existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot
image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative
improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our
results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework
for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for
resource-constrained domains.

Conclusion: LunarLoc为月球任务提供了高精度定位解决方案，并公开数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar
surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS,
is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the
Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks
such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as
excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but
proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry
drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important
for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on
autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To
help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an
approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for
zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment
detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain,
which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a
previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables
accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings.
LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization
experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global
localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global
localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback
module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了LAION-C作为ImageNet-C的替代基准，旨在解决现有基准在评估OOD鲁棒性时因数据规模扩大而失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD基准（如ImageNet-C）在Web规模数据集时代已不再适用，因为其失真类型已包含在训练数据中，无法有效评估模型的OOD泛化能力。

Method: 设计了六种新型失真类型构建LAION-C，确保其对Web规模数据集（如LAION）仍为OOD，并评估了包括MLLMs在内的先进模型。

Result: LAION-C对当代模型（如Gemini和GPT-4o）构成显著挑战，且最佳模型的OOD泛化能力已接近或超越人类观察者。

Conclusion: LAION-C为OOD鲁棒性评估提供了更有效的基准，揭示了模型在OOD泛化上的范式转变。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision
models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from
robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets
such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C
corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped
datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG
compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited
for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent
models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that
it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better
at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test
distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a
benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion
types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as
LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that
the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,
including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a
psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for
human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human
robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans
outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best
human observers.

Conclusion: Defusion通过视觉指令引导的退化扩散，实现了更高的稳定性和泛化能力，为全能图像恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration tasks like deblurring, denoising, and dehazing usually need
distinct models for each degradation type, restricting their generalization in
real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that
utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing
methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors,
Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the
visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying
degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation
features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual
instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the
degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the
degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world
degradations.

low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing
generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based
models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation,
which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow,
a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a
deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the
degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the
uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation
process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented
degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves
the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer
than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow
achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks,
offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MICS的新方法，用于生成高质量的医疗链式思维（CoT）数据，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在医疗领域的应用尚处于早期阶段，缺乏有效的推理路径搜索和评估框架。

Method: 提出MICS方法，通过导师-实习生协作搜索生成严格的医疗CoT数据，并构建多任务医疗推理数据集MMRP和新型医疗MLLM Chiron-o1。

Result: 实验表明，基于MICS构建的CoT数据集训练的Chiron-o1在医疗视觉问答和推理任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MICS方法为医疗MLLMs提供了有效的推理路径生成框架，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust
reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical
domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical
MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a
comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths
towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern
Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to
generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor
models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each
intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally
selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning
performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined
by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.
Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with
ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum
learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable
reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,
trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning
benchmarks. Codes are available at GitHub - manglu097/Chiron-o1: Enhancing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有提示驱动的无监督域适应方法依赖大型视觉语言模型和完整源域数据访问的问题，提升在资源受限环境（如无人机）中的适用性。

Method: 使用蒸馏和微调的CLIP模型作为Faster R-CNN教师的冻结主干，通过提示驱动的实例归一化（PIN）对齐低层源特征与目标域语义，生成高质量伪标签指导紧凑学生模型适应。

Result: 在MDS-A数据集上，Prmpt2Adpt实现了与最先进方法相当的检测性能，同时适应速度快7倍，推理速度快5倍。

Conclusion: Prmpt2Adpt是一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，适用于低资源领域的实时域适应。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world
vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones,
where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods
typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to
source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain
adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by
prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and
fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A
small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain
semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven
Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to
briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher
then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly
adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset
demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x
faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and
scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单车辆的感知能力受限于遮挡、传感器范围和视角，协作感知可以交换互补信息以提高准确性和完整性。

Result: 基线模型在扩展预测范围时表现优于单车辆模型，增益随范围增加而提升。

Conclusion: 协作感知能显著提升3D语义占用预测的性能，尤其在长距离预测中效果更明显。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in
autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric
details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single
vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and
narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception
enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the
completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for
collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing
collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a
high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive
occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying
prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial
extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that
performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention
aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model
consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as
the prediction range expands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界超分辨率重建依赖反映真实退化模式的数据集，但现有方法难以同时捕捉模糊、噪声和隐式退化。

Method: TripleGAN框架包含三个GAN：FirstGAN缩小模糊域差距，SecondGAN学习目标域模糊特性和额外退化模式，ThirdGAN重建真实低分辨率图像。

Result: 在RealSR和DRealSR数据集上，方法在定量指标上表现优越，重建图像清晰无过度平滑。

Conclusion: TripleGAN能有效学习真实退化模式并合成对齐数据集，显著提升超分辨率重建质量。

Abstract: The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily
relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and
modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only
real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When
synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on
degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise
characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit
degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone
cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the
significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two
strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing
the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs
domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and
learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real
data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR
images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate
that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while
maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The
proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR
observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation
characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior
performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.

Result: SaLT模型在历史和未来车牌数据上均表现优异，保持了高准确率。

Conclusion: SaLT通过语法无关建模提升了车牌识别的鲁棒性，适用于动态变化的实际场景。

Abstract: Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to
constant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While
Transformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we
observe significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for
tense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art
results on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they
perform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters
are wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the
flows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders,
we identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following,
we devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT,
an attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license
plate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show
that our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly
nearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate
the robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.

Conclusion: Assembler为交互式和组合式设计提供了潜力，展示了从图像生成高分辨率可编辑对象的能力。

Abstract: We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part
assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a
reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part
pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle
diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and
structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part
assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data.
First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs
diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing
ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid
assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on
sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space
rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of
over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering
pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate
high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we
further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates
high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for
interactive and compositional design. Project page:

Motivation: 提升自动驾驶车辆对复杂驾驶环境的理解能力，解决多标签分类中数据集获取和任务平衡的挑战。

Method: 通过KAA从单标签数据集中获取知识，再通过CAL解决属性分布差异导致的知识缺口。

Result: 在DSI数据集上性能提升56.1%，KAA和CAL分别贡献31.3%和24.8%。在BDD100K和HSD数据集上表现优于SOTA模型，且数据使用量减少85%。

Conclusion: KAA-CAL方法在多标签驾驶场景识别中表现出色，显著提升了性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class
labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing
autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the
complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is
better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a
multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through
multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced,
comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across
different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes
knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active
learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates
knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via
monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap
caused by the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of individual
attributes and their joint distribution. An ablation study on our Driving Scene
Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the
baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the
gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best
performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two
public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The
DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available at

Conclusion: MEXA展示了专家驱动选择和聚合在多模态推理任务中的有效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable
multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due
to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For
instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical
tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to
make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a
training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of
multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse
and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input
modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert
model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual
reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a
Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design
allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains
without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on
diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D
Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance
improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness
and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in
diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Result: 提出的动态水印技术能实现来源识别和篡改检测，并具有可控的灵敏度-鲁棒性权衡。

Conclusion: pgSPAD成像器在数字水印领域具有潜力，能够提供高安全性和灵活性。

Abstract: Digital image watermarks as a security feature can be derived from the
imager's physically unclonable functions (PUFs) by utilizing the manufacturing
variations, i.e., the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU). While a few
demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors
(APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been
investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel
watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized
the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m
standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test
images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source
identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed
source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable
sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下具有解决医学图像分割任务的潜力。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning addresses the issue of limited annotations in
medical images effectively, but its performance is often inadequate for complex
backgrounds and challenging tasks. Multi-modal fusion methods can significantly
improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary
information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant
improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of
effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an
effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled
data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which
leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with
limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and
enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information,
while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and
alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to
constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the
robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental
results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and
robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for
solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: 条件特征对齐能有效提升跨域计数的泛化能力，理论和实验均验证其优势。

Abstract: Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing
density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate
standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a
theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the
notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets
(e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then
derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as
condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on
the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These
insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving
task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve
superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining
conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a
practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in
unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with
varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms
existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the
theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.

Method: 使用SoccerNet Echoes数据集中的时间戳评论，通过三个LLM分别评估结果、兴奋度和战术，识别关键动作（如进球、黄牌等）。

Result: 实验表明，这种基于语言的方法能有效检测关键比赛事件，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为动作识别提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的替代方案，优于传统视频方法。

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on
visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to
process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this
video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable
by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained
descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,
contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To
demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides
timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges
specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding
windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,
generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this
language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match
events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional
video-based methods for action spotting.

Result: 在多种CT和组织病理学数据集上，Co-Seg++在语义、实例和全景分割中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Co-Seg++通过任务协同显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性和理解能力。

Abstract: Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly
segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures
and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated
different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental
interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation
performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this
issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation.
Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic
and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise
a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial
and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as
prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative
decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the
contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance
segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology
datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts
in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical
structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances. The source code is

objects over time and preserving object identity can help to improve object
detection performance, and is necessary for many downstream tasks, including
classifying and predicting behaviors, and estimating total abundances. Here we
present yasmot, a lightweight and flexible object tracker that can process the
output from popular object detectors and track objects over time from either
monoscopic or stereoscopic camera configurations. In addition, it includes
functionality to generate consensus detections from ensembles of object
detectors.

Conclusion: 面部标志箱线图技术有助于数据集分析，神经网络是更优的情感识别模型。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer
interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial
expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to
train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a
through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when
extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose
facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify
outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial
landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their
displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression.
Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a
random forest classifier.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have
enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the
groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current
methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and
efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To
address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for
high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve
fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a
shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between
various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid
history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences
autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to
enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to
reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long
temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex
interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset
comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games,
ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated
synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data
significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly
outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of
interactive game video generation.

Result: UniFork性能优于传统共享架构，与任务特定模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: UniFork通过平衡共享学习和任务专业化，解决了统一模型中的冲突问题。

Abstract: Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising
paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the
optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge.
In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of
task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as
current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:
understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment
across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better
comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality
alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to
recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a
fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform
representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks.
Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture
that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while
employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference.
This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization.
Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork
consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures,
and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

TL;DR: Mirage框架通过引入潜在视觉标记增强视觉语言模型的解码能力，避免显式图像生成，从而提升多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在需要视觉想象的任务中表现受限，因为它们必须将视觉推理转化为文本。显式图像生成又可能损害推理能力。

Method: 提出Mirage框架，通过潜在视觉标记和文本交替解码，监督学习阶段从图像嵌入蒸馏开始，随后转向文本监督，最后通过强化学习增强推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，Mirage在不生成显式图像的情况下，显著提升了多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: Mirage为视觉语言模型提供了一种更高效的多模态推理方法，避免了显式图像生成的负担。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their
text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting
performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs
to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often
hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental
imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we
investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories
without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental
Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent
visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses
to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby
continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin
by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image
embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent
trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement
learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger
multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

Motivation: 研究视频扩散模型内部如何建立和表示帧间时间对应关系，填补了这一领域的空白。

Method: 通过构建带有伪真实跟踪注释的数据集，并提出新的评估指标，系统分析了DiTs的3D注意力机制中各组件的作用。

Result: 发现特定层的查询-键相似性在时间匹配中起关键作用，且在去噪过程中逐渐显著；DiffTrack在零样本点跟踪中表现优异，并能改进视频生成的时间一致性。

Conclusion: DiffTrack为理解视频DiTs的内部机制提供了重要见解，并为未来研究和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers
(DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent
videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally
establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce
DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this
question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo
ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to
systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention
mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to
establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key
similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal
matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the
denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in
zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models.
Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a
novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos
without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into
the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further
research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

Conclusion: VLN-R1展示了LVLM在具身导航中的潜力，并通过数据高效、奖励驱动的后训练增强任务特定推理。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI,
requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language
instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on
discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node
connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams
into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by
DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego
dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling
to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can
supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level
control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with
expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced
with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights
multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong
performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied
navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient,
reward-driven post-training.

Abstract: Structural coloration is commonly modeled using wave optics for reliable and
photorealistic rendering of natural, quasi-periodic and complex nanostructures.
Such models often rely on dense, preliminary or preprocessed data to accurately
capture the nuanced variations in diffractive surface reflectances. This heavy
data dependency warrants implicit neural representation which has not been
addressed comprehensively in the current literature. In this paper, we present
a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based method for data-driven rendering of
diffractive surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency. We primarily approach
this problem from a data compression perspective to devise a nuanced training
and modeling method which is attuned to the domain and range characteristics of
diffractive reflectance datasets. Importantly, our approach avoids over-fitting
and has robust resampling behavior. Using Peak-Signal-to-Noise (PSNR),
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and a flipping difference evaluator
(FLIP) as evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the high-quality reconstruction of
the ground-truth. In comparison to a recent state-of-the-art offline,
wave-optical, forward modeling approach, our method reproduces subjectively
similar results with significant performance gains. We reduce the memory
footprint of the raw datasets by two orders of magnitude in general. Lastly, we
depict the working of our method with actual surface renderings.

Conclusion: VEIGAR在效率和效果上实现了优越的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have
significantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining
cross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods
typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing
consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either
explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D
reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in
particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish
geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with
the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.
In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that
outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction
phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors
explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision
strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for
traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.
Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art
benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving
a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,
highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该方法是一种即插即用且框架无关的解决方案，为可扩展的、曲率感知的SDF学习提供了实用路径，适用于工程级形状重建。

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) have become a versatile backbone for
geometric learning, yet enforcing developable, CAD-style behavior still hinges
on Gaussian curvature penalties that require full Hessian evaluation and
second-order automatic differentiation, both of which are costly in memory and
runtime. We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed
second-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to
adapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary
instantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces
each Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order
gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative
via one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and
remaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second
derivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full
second-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the
reconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory
use and wall-clock time by a factor of two. Because the method is drop-in and
framework-agnostic, it opens a practical path toward scalable, curvature-aware
SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction.

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image
synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing
PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a
physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic
diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet,
Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom
Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence,
we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and
capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns
to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel
generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of
our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based
corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and
quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette
unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and
deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed
image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

Abstract: 3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands
high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated
omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from
pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic
data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits
their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane
synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities
can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design,
we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D
panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to
achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D

Abstract: Fairness is desirable yet challenging to achieve within multi-agent systems,
especially when agents differ in latent traits that affect their abilities.
This hidden heterogeneity often leads to unequal distributions of wealth, even
when agents operate under the same rules. Motivated by real-world examples, we
propose a framework based on repeated principal-agent games, where a principal,
who also can be seen as a player of the game, learns to offer adaptive
contracts to agents. By leveraging a simple yet powerful contract structure, we
show that a fairness-aware principal can learn homogeneous linear contracts
that equalize outcomes across agents in a sequential social dilemma.
Importantly, this fairness does not come at the cost of efficiency: our results
demonstrate that it is possible to promote equity and stability in the system
while preserving overall performance.

TL;DR: 论文首次证明了在两人零和凸马尔可夫博弈中，独立策略梯度方法能全局收敛到纳什均衡。通过非凸正则化将问题转化为NC-pPL目标，并提供了全局收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 凸马尔可夫博弈扩展了多智能体交互的建模框架，但其非凸性和无限时域复杂性带来了挑战。

Method: 采用两步法：1）通过非凸正则化将问题转化为NC-pPL目标；2）在NC-pPL条件下分析梯度下降-上升方法的收敛性。

Result: 证明了独立策略梯度方法在凸马尔可夫博弈中的全局收敛性。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂博弈问题提供了理论保证，并可能对其他优化问题有独立意义。

Abstract: We contribute the first provable guarantees of global convergence to Nash
equilibria (NE) in two-player zero-sum convex Markov games (cMGs) by using
independent policy gradient methods. Convex Markov games, recently defined by
Gemp et al. (2024), extend Markov decision processes to multi-agent settings
with preferences that are convex over occupancy measures, offering a broad
framework for modeling generic strategic interactions. However, even the
fundamental min-max case of cMGs presents significant challenges, including
inherent nonconvexity, the absence of Bellman consistency, and the complexity
of the infinite horizon.
  We follow a two-step approach. First, leveraging properties of
hidden-convex--hidden-concave functions, we show that a simple nonconvex
regularization transforms the min-max optimization problem into a
nonconvex-proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz (NC-pPL) objective. Crucially, this
regularization can stabilize the iterates of independent policy gradient
methods and ultimately lead them to converge to equilibria. Second, building on
this reduction, we address the general constrained min-max problems under
NC-pPL and two-sided pPL conditions, providing the first global convergence
guarantees for stochastic nested and alternating gradient descent-ascent
methods, which we believe may be of independent interest.

TL;DR: 本文研究了组合拍卖中“最低中标价”概念的推广，特别针对视频广告中的视频插播拍卖，提出了保持分配最优性的投标更新方法，并通过实证分析验证了其动态和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于视频广告中的组合拍卖问题，尤其是如何将“最低中标价”反馈机制推广到更复杂的拍卖场景中。

Method: 方法包括将问题建模为保持分配最优性的投标更新（折扣和加价），并通过双合作博弈的核心理论进行表征。对于分配问题的特殊情况，提供了线性规划的表征。

Result: 主要结果是通过双合作博弈核心理论表征了保持最优性的投标更新集合，并提出了几种广义最低中标价的候选方案。

Conclusion: 结论是通过实证分析验证了这些候选方案在视频插播拍卖中的动态和收敛性，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In first-price auctions for display advertising, exchanges typically
communicate the "minimum-bid-to-win" to bidders after the auction as feedback
for their bidding algorithms. For a winner, this is the second-highest bid,
while for losing bidders it is the highest bid. In this paper we investigate
the generalization of this concept to general combinatorial auctions, motivated
by the domain of video advertising. In a video pod auction, ad slots during an
advertising break in a video stream are auctioned all at once, under several
kinds of allocation constraints such as a constraint on total ad duration. We
cast the problem in terms of computing bid updates (discounts and raises) that
maintain the optimality of the current allocation. Our main result
characterizes the set of joint bid updates with this property as the core of an
associated bicooperative game. In the case of the assignment problem--a special
case of video pod auctions--we provide a linear programming characterization of
this bicooperative core. Our characterization leads to several candidates for a
generalized minimum-bid-to-win. Drawing on video pod auction data from a real
ad exchange, we perform an empirical analysis to understand the bidding
dynamics they induce and their convergence properties.

*Ezzat Elokda,Andrea Censi,Emilio Frazzoli,Florian Dörfler,Saverio Bolognani*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于“因果经济”的非货币机制，用于解决未来智能城市中稀缺公共资源的公平、高效分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统货币机制在社会技术资源分配中效果不佳，需要一种更可信、公平且高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过动态重复博弈视角，引入因果经济机制，以长期纳什福利作为公平与效率的衡量标准。

Result: 研究表明，因果纳什均衡在动态资源分配中能最大化长期纳什福利。

Conclusion: 因果经济为未来智能城市的多资源分配提供了灵活的设计空间，可根据需求选择资源整合或分离。

Abstract: Control systems will play a pivotal role in addressing societal-scale
challenges as they drive the development of sustainable future smart cities. At
the heart of these challenges is the trustworthy, fair, and efficient
allocation of scarce public resources, including renewable energy,
transportation, data, computation, etc.. Historical evidence suggests that
monetary control -- the prototypical mechanism for managing resource scarcity
-- is not always well-accepted in socio-technical resource contexts. In this
vision article, we advocate for karma economies as an emerging non-monetary
mechanism for socio-technical control. Karma leverages the repetitive nature of
many socio-technical resources to jointly attain trustworthy, fair, and
efficient allocations; by budgeting resource consumption over time and letting
resource users ``play against their future selves.'' To motivate karma, we
review related concepts in economics through a control systems lens, and make a
case for a) shifting the viewpoint of resource allocations from single-shot and
static to repeated and dynamic games; and b) adopting long-run Nash welfare as
the formalization of ``fairness and efficiency'' in socio-technical contexts.
We show that in many dynamic resource settings, karma Nash equilibria maximize
long-run Nash welfare. Moreover, we discuss implications for a future smart
city built on multi-karma economies: by choosing whether to combine different
socio-technical resources, e.g., electricity and transportation, in a single
karma economy, or separate into resource-specific economies, karma provides new
flexibility to design the scope of fairness and efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多目标函数，结合响应可能性和情绪预测不确定性，优化EMA发送时机，以提高响应率并捕捉更广泛的情绪范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mHealth研究中，EMA依从性对情绪识别模型至关重要，但现有方法可能导致情绪样本偏差。

Method: 提出多目标函数，结合响应可能性和模型不确定性，优化EMA发送时间。

Result: 在两个数据集上验证，多目标函数在响应EMA和捕捉少见情绪时表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法可提高EMA响应率并丰富情绪数据多样性。

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) systems help researchers monitor and care for
patients in real-world settings. Studies utilizing mHealth applications use
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMAs), passive sensing, and contextual
features to develop emotion recognition models, which rely on EMA responses as
ground truth. Due to this, it is crucial to consider EMA compliance when
conducting a successful mHealth study. Utilizing machine learning is one
approach that can solve this problem by sending EMAs based on the predicted
likelihood of a response. However, literature suggests that this approach may
lead to prompting participants more frequently during emotions associated with
responsiveness, thereby narrowing the range of emotions collected. We propose a
multi-objective function that utilizes machine learning to identify optimal
times for sending EMAs. The function identifies optimal moments by combining
predicted response likelihood with model uncertainty in emotion predictions.
Uncertainty would lead the function to prioritize time points when the model is
less confident, which often corresponds to underrepresented emotions. We
demonstrate that this objective function would result in EMAs being sent when
participants are responsive and experiencing less commonly observed emotions.
The evaluation is conducted offline using two datasets: (1) 91 spousal
caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related dementias
(ADRD), (2) 45 healthy participants. Results show that the multi-objective
function tends to be higher when participants respond to EMAs and report less
commonly observed emotions. This suggests that using the proposed objective
function to guide EMA delivery could improve receptivity rates and capture a
broader range of emotions.

TL;DR: DeckFlow是一个多模态生成AI工具，通过任务分解、规范分解和生成空间探索解决现有工具的三大设计问题，并在文本到图像和音频生成任务中进行了评估。


<details>

Motivation: 现有生成AI工具存在设计问题，无法高效支持个性化媒体创作，DeckFlow旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DeckFlow通过无限画布上的卡片连接、规范分解工作流和生成空间探索（网格展示多提示和输出变体）实现功能。

Result: DeckFlow在文本到图像生成任务中优于现有对话式AI基线，并在多模态（文本、图像、音频）开放创意场景中验证了用户行为。

Conclusion: DeckFlow通过创新设计解决了生成AI工具的局限性，支持更高效的个性化创作。

Abstract: Generative AI promises to allow people to create high-quality personalized
media. Although powerful, we identify three fundamental design problems with
existing tooling through a literature review. We introduce a multimodal
generative AI tool, DeckFlow, to address these problems. First, DeckFlow
supports task decomposition by allowing users to maintain multiple
interconnected subtasks on an infinite canvas populated by cards connected
through visual dataflow affordances. Second, DeckFlow supports a specification
decomposition workflow where an initial goal is iteratively decomposed into
smaller parts and combined using feature labels and clusters. Finally, DeckFlow
supports generative space exploration by generating multiple prompt and output
variations, presented in a grid, that can feed back recursively into the next
design iteration. We evaluate DeckFlow for text-to-image generation against a
state-of-practice conversational AI baseline for image generation tasks. We
then add audio generation and investigate user behaviors in a more open-ended
creative setting with text, image, and audio outputs.

<details>

Motivation: 解决读者在遇到新数据集时难以理解数据分组与现实意义之间联系的困难。

Method: 开发了语义支架技术，包括语义分箱（semantic bins）和数据高亮（data highlights），并在可视化工具Olli中实现和评估。

Result: 15名盲人和低视力用户的实验表明，语义支架能快速帮助理解数据，但用户也意识到其对解释的影响。

Conclusion: 语义支架有效辅助数据理解，但需平衡明确分组与读者自主探索的需求。

Abstract: Drawing connections between interesting groupings of data and their
real-world meaning is an important, yet difficult, part of encountering a new
dataset. A lay reader might see an interesting visual pattern in a chart but
lack the domain expertise to explain its meaning. Or, a reader might be
familiar with a real-world concept but struggle to express it in terms of a
dataset's fields. In response, we developed semantic scaffolding, a technique
for using domain-specific information from large language models (LLMs) to
identify, explain, and formalize semantically meaningful data groupings. We
present groupings in two ways: as semantic bins, which segment a field into
domain-specific intervals and categories; and data highlights, which annotate
subsets of data records with their real-world meaning. We demonstrate and
evaluate this technique in Olli, an accessible visualization tool that
exemplifies tensions around explicitly defining groupings while respecting the
agency of readers to conduct independent data exploration. We conducted a study
with 15 blind and low-vision (BLV) users and found that readers used semantic
scaffolds to quickly understand the meaning of the data, but were often also
critically aware of its influence on their interpretation.

Motivation: 解决对话中因知识差异导致的沟通障碍。

Result: 实验表明，优化后的信息展示方法减少了被察觉的风险，并提升了对话的平衡性和兴奋感。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效改善对话质量，尤其在知识差异较大的场景中。

Abstract: Engaging in smooth conversations with others is a crucial social skill.
However, differences in knowledge between conversation participants can
sometimes hinder effective communication. To tackle this issue, this study
proposes a real-time support system that integrates head-mounted display
(HMD)-based augmented reality (AR) technology with large language models
(LLMs). This system facilitates conversation by recognizing keywords during
dialogue, generating relevant information using the LLM, reformatting it, and
presenting it to the user via the HMD. A significant issue with this system is
that the user's eye movements may reveal to the conversation partner that they
are reading the displayed text. This study also proposes a method for
presenting information that takes into account appropriate eye movements during
conversation. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed system. The first experiment revealed that the proposed
information presentation method reduces the likelihood of the conversation
partner noticing that the user is reading the displayed text. The second
experiment demonstrated that the proposed method led to a more balanced speech
ratio between the user and the conversation partner, as well as a increase in
the perceived excitement of the conversation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的小组讨论因地理、财务和时间限制难以普及，SimuPanel旨在通过技术手段解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多智能体交互框架，模拟专家讨论，结合3D可视化环境增强互动性，并基于多媒体资源建模专家推理策略和角色。

Result: 技术评估和用户研究表明，SimuPanel能模拟深入讨论并提升参与者互动与反思。

Conclusion: SimuPanel为多媒体学习中的小组讨论提供了改进方向，展示了未来潜力。

Abstract: Panel discussion allows the audience to learn different perspectives through
interactive discussions among experts moderated by a host and a Q&A session
with the audience. Despite its benefits, panel discussion in the real world is
inaccessible to many who do not have the privilege to participate due to
geographical, financial, and time constraints. We present SimuPanel, which
simulates panel discussions among academic experts through LLM-based
multi-agent interaction. It enables users to define topics of interest for the
panel, observe the expert discussion, engage in Q&A, and take notes. SimuPanel
employs a host-expert architecture where each panel member is simulated by an
agent with specialized expertise, and the panel is visualized in an immersive
3D environment to enhance engagement. Traditional dialogue generation struggles
to capture the depth and interactivity of real-world panel discussions. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent interaction framework
that simulates authentic panel dynamics by modeling reasoning strategies and
personas of experts grounded in multimedia sources. This framework enables
agents to dynamically recall and contribute to the discussion based on past
experiences from diverse perspectives. Our technical evaluation and the user
study with university students show that SimuPanel was able to simulate more
in-depth discussions and engage participants to interact with and reflect on
the discussions. As a first step in this direction, we offer design
implications for future avenues to improve and harness the power of panel
discussion for multimedia learning.

Abstract: With recent advancements in AI and computational tools, intelligent paradigms
have emerged to enhance fields like shared autonomy and human-machine teaming
in healthcare. Advanced AI algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) can
autonomously make decisions to achieve planning and motion goals. However, in
healthcare, where human intent is crucial, fully independent machine decisions
may not be ideal. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of
human-centered shared autonomy AI frameworks, focusing on upper limb
biosignal-based machine interfaces and associated motor control systems,
including computer cursors, robotic arms, and planar platforms. We examine
motor planning, learning (rehabilitation), and control, covering conceptual
foundations of human-machine teaming in reach-and-grasp tasks and analyzing
both theoretical and practical implementations. Each section explores how human
and machine inputs can be blended for shared autonomy in healthcare
applications. Topics include human factors, biosignal processing for intent
detection, shared autonomy in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), rehabilitation,
assistive robotics, and Large Language Models (LLMs) as the next frontier. We
propose adaptive shared autonomy AI as a high-performance paradigm for
collaborative human-AI systems, identify key implementation challenges, and
outline future directions, particularly regarding AI reasoning agents. This
analysis aims to bridge neuroscientific insights with robotics to create more
intuitive, effective, and ethical human-machine teaming frameworks.

Abstract: Imagine unlocking the power of the mind to communicate, create, and even
interact with the world around us. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), especially in how machines "see" and "understand" language,
are now fueling exciting progress in decoding brain signals from scalp
electroencephalography (EEG). Prima facie, this opens the door to revolutionary
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) designed for real life, moving beyond
traditional uses to envision Brain-to-Speech, Brain-to-Image, and even a
Brain-to-Internet of Things (BCIoT).
  However, the journey is not as straightforward as it was for Computer Vision
(CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Applying AI to real-world EEG-based
BCIs, particularly in building powerful foundational models, presents unique
and intricate hurdles that could affect their reliability.
  Here, we unfold a guided exploration of this dynamic and rapidly evolving
research area. Rather than barely outlining a map of current endeavors and
results, the goal is to provide a principled navigation of this hot and
cutting-edge research landscape. We consider the basic paradigms that emerge
from a causal perspective and the attendant challenges presented to AI-based
models. Looking ahead, we then discuss promising research avenues that could
overcome today's technological, methodological, and ethical limitations. Our
aim is to lay out a clear roadmap for creating truly practical and effective

Result: 初步结果揭示了13种可视化技术的相似性，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 研究为理解可视化技术相似性提供了初步探索，未来需进一步验证和扩展。

Abstract: The literature describes many visualization techniques for different types of
data, tasks, and application contexts, and new techniques are proposed on a
regular basis. Visualization surveys try to capture the immense space of
techniques and structure it with meaningful categorizations. Yet, it remains
difficult to understand the similarity of visualization techniques in general.
We approach this open research question from two angles. First, we follow a
model-driven approach that is based on defining the signature of visualization
techniques and interpreting the similarity of signatures as the similarity of
their associated techniques. Second, following an expert-driven approach, we
asked visualization experts in a small online study for their ad-hoc intuitive
assessment of the similarity of pairs visualization techniques. From both
approaches, we gain insight into the similarity of a set of 13 basic and
advanced visualizations for different types of data. While our results are so
far preliminary and academic, they are first steps toward better understanding
the similarity of visualization techniques.

Conclusion: 可解释反馈对深化学习和培养可迁移技能至关重要，尤其在学术写作中。

Abstract: This study investigated the impact of a theory-driven, explainable Learning
Analytics Dashboard (LAD) on university students' human-AI collaborative
academic abstract writing task. Grounded in Self-Regulated Learning (SRL)
theory and incorporating Explainable AI (XAI) principles, our LAD featured a
three-layered design (Visual, Explainable, Interactive). In an experimental
study, participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group
(using the full explainable LAD) or a control group (using a visual-only LAD)
to collaboratively write an academic abstract with a Generative AI. While
quantitative analysis revealed no significant difference in the quality of
co-authored abstracts between the two groups, a significant and noteworthy
difference emerged in conceptual understanding: students in the explainable LAD
group demonstrated a superior grasp of abstract writing principles, as
evidenced by their higher scores on a knowledge test (p= .026). These findings
highlight that while basic AI-generated feedback may suffice for immediate task
completion, the provision of explainable feedback is crucial for fostering
deeper learning, enhancing conceptual understanding, and developing
transferable skills fundamental to self-regulated learning in academic writing

Motivation: 研究GPT-4o在启发式评估中的表现，并与人类专家对比，以探索其在HCI中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用Nielsen的启发式方法，通过GPT-4o和人类专家评估同一组网页截图。

Result: GPT-4o识别的问题与人类专家重叠率低，且存在误报。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在启发式评估中可作为辅助工具，但需谨慎使用以避免误报。

Abstract: Heuristic evaluation is a widely used method in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) to inspect interfaces and identify issues based on heuristics. Recently,
Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, have been applied in HCI to
assist in persona creation, the ideation process, and the analysis of
semi-structured interviews. However, considering the need to understand
heuristics and the high degree of abstraction required to evaluate them, LLMs
may have difficulty conducting heuristic evaluation. However, prior research
has not investigated GPT-4o's performance in heuristic evaluation compared to
HCI experts in web-based systems. In this context, this study aims to compare
the results of a heuristic evaluation performed by GPT-4o and human experts. To
this end, we selected a set of screenshots from a web system and asked GPT-4o
to perform a heuristic evaluation based on Nielsen's Heuristics from a
literature-grounded prompt. Our results indicate that only 21.2% of the issues
identified by human experts were also identified by GPT-4o, despite it found 27
new issues. We also found that GPT-4o performed better for heuristics related
to aesthetic and minimalist design and match between system and real world,
whereas it has difficulty identifying issues in heuristics related to
flexibility, control, and user efficiency. Additionally, we noticed that GPT-4o
generated several false positives due to hallucinations and attempts to predict
issues. Finally, we highlight five takeaways for the conscious use of GPT-4o in
heuristic evaluations.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过高密度表面EMG系统结合FES系统，实现对瘫痪足部运动的闭环控制，发现SCI患者保留的EMG活动可用于准确控制足部运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助脊髓损伤（SCI）患者恢复足部运动，提高生活质量。

Method: 使用可穿戴高密度表面EMG系统解码保留的MU活动，结合FES系统实现闭环控制。

Result: 所有参与者均保留至少三种踝关节运动的EMG活动，部分参与者能准确控制足部屈伸，且FES系统能显著恢复运动范围。

Conclusion: 该系统为SCI患者提供了一种直观的闭环控制方法，有望帮助恢复运动功能。

Abstract: Restoring movement of a paralyzed foot is a key challenge in helping
individuals with neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury (SCI) to
improve their quality of life. Neuroprostheses based on functional electrical
stimulation (FES) can restore the physiological range of motion by stimulating
the affected muscles using surface electrodes. We have previously shown that,
despite chronic motor-complete SCI, it is possible to capture paralyzed hand
movements in individuals with tetraplegia using spared and modulated motor unit
(MU) activity decoded with non-invasive electromyography (EMG) sensors. This
study investigated whether a wearable high-density surface EMG system could
capture and control paralyzed foot kinematics in closed-loop control with an
FES system. We found that all our participants with SCI (2 with chronic SCI and
3 with acute SCI) retained distinct spared EMG activity for at least three
ankle movements, which allowed them to reliably control a digital cursor using
their spared tibialis anterior and triceps surae MU activity. Movement
separability was further reconfirmed by extracting task-modulated MU activity
during foot flexion/extension (3-7 modulated MUs/participant). Three
participants were further able to modulate and maintain their foot
flexion/extension EMG levels with an accuracy of >70%. Lastly, we show that
real-time control of a FES system using EMG from the affected limb can restore
foot movements in a highly intuitive way, significantly improving the lost or
pathological foot range of motion. Our system provides an intuitive approach
for closed-loop control of FES that has the potential to assist individuals
with SCI in regaining lost motor functions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究比较了机器人对话与传统心理治疗对话的相似性，发现90.88%的机器人对话主题可映射到人类治疗对话的聚类中，且语义高度重叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对话机器人在情感支持中的应用增多，需评估其与人类治疗对话的相似性。

Method: 分析两个数据集（人类治疗对话与机器人对话），使用句子嵌入和K-means聚类评估主题对齐，并通过距离方法验证。

Result: 机器人对话主题与人类治疗对话高度匹配，语义分析显示响应也相似。

Conclusion: 机器人支持对话与传统治疗有显著相似性，可能辅助心理健康干预。

Abstract: As conversational agents increasingly engage in emotionally supportive
dialogue, it is important to understand how closely their interactions resemble
those in traditional therapy settings. This study investigates whether the
concerns shared with a robot align with those shared in human-to-human (H2H)
therapy sessions, and whether robot responses semantically mirror those of
human therapists. We analyzed two datasets: one of interactions between users
and professional therapists (Hugging Face's NLP Mental Health Conversations),
and another involving supportive conversations with a social robot (QTrobot
from LuxAI) powered by a large language model (LLM, GPT-3.5). Using sentence
embeddings and K-means clustering, we assessed cross-agent thematic alignment
by applying a distance-based cluster-fitting method that evaluates whether
responses from one agent type map to clusters derived from the other, and
validated it using Euclidean distances. Results showed that 90.88% of robot
conversation disclosures could be mapped to clusters from the human therapy
dataset, suggesting shared topical structure. For matched clusters, we compared
the subjects as well as therapist and robot responses using Transformer,
Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings, revealing strong semantic overlap in subjects'
disclosures in both datasets, as well as in the responses given to similar
human disclosure themes across agent types (robot vs. human therapist). These
findings highlight both the parallels and boundaries of robot-led support
conversations and their potential for augmenting mental health interventions.

Result: 多数参与者认为AI模拟面试逼真且有用，提升了信心和问题解决表达能力，但对话流畅性和时间管理仍需改进。

Conclusion: AI驱动的技术面试具有潜力作为可扩展的准备工具，未来可研究不同面试行为对候选人的影响。

Abstract: Technical interviews are a critical yet stressful step in the hiring process
for computer science graduates, often hindered by limited access to practice
opportunities. This formative qualitative study (n=20) explores whether a
multimodal AI system can realistically simulate technical interviews and
support confidence-building among candidates. Participants engaged with an
AI-driven mock interview tool featuring whiteboarding tasks and real-time
feedback. Many described the experience as realistic and helpful, noting
increased confidence and improved articulation of problem-solving decisions.
However, challenges with conversational flow and timing were noted. These
findings demonstrate the potential of AI-driven technical interviews as
scalable and realistic preparation tools, suggesting that future research could
explore variations in interviewer behavior and their potential effects on
candidate preparation.

Method: 利用学生创建的可视化笔记本作为数据源，结合LLMs生成问题-答案-原理三元组，并通过验证和筛选构建数据集。

Result: 构建了一个捕捉学生可视化设计选择及其原理的数据集，为研究设计决策提供了新资源。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解可视化设计原理提供了新视角，数据集可用于进一步研究设计决策的自然语言表达。

Abstract: Prior natural language datasets for data visualization have focused on tasks
such as visualization literacy assessment, insight generation, and
visualization generation from natural language instructions. These studies
often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and
artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the
interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather
than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and
methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural
language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural
language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as
part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts
with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind
their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate
and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and
articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and
curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices
and corresponding rationales of the students.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在建筑场景中，信任预测对安全和效率至关重要，但现有方法难以准确评估信任水平。

Method: 设计多难度人机协作场景，融合ECG、GSR和EMG等生理信号与协作表现评估，进行信任预测。

Result: 模型在三级别信任分类中准确率达81%，七级别分类中达74.3%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 协作表现引导的生理信号处理显著提升了信任预测性能，为研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Trust prediction is a key issue in human-robot collaboration, especially in
construction scenarios where maintaining appropriate trust calibration is
critical for safety and efficiency. This paper introduces the
Performance-guided Physiological signal-based Trust Prediction (PPTP), a novel
framework designed to improve trust assessment. We designed a human-robot
construction scenario with three difficulty levels to induce different trust
states. Our approach integrates synchronized multimodal physiological signals
(ECG, GSR, and EMG) with collaboration performance evaluation to predict human
trust levels. Individual physiological signals are processed using
collaboration performance information as guiding cues, leveraging the
standardized nature of collaboration performance to compensate for individual
variations in physiological responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of our cross-modality fusion method in significantly improving trust
classification performance. Our model achieves over 81% accuracy in three-level
trust classification, outperforming the best baseline method by 6.7%, and
notably reaches 74.3% accuracy in high-resolution seven-level classification,
which is a first in trust prediction research. Ablation experiments further
validate the superiority of physiological signal processing guided by
collaboration performance assessment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉上下文感知的语音合成方法（V-CASS），通过分析视频中的副语言线索生成情感和态度一致的语音，提升用户对视频内容的理解和参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频解说系统常忽略情感和态度等副语言线索，导致用户理解受限或内容意图被扭曲。

Method: 提出V-CASS方法，结合视觉语言模型分析视频中的副语言线索，并利用知识增强的语言模型指导语音合成。

Result: 用户研究表明，V-CASS显著提升了情感共鸣和用户理解，74.68%的参与者更偏好该系统。

Conclusion: V-CASS不仅提升了视频解说的效果，还为视障用户提供了更好的视频访问体验。

Abstract: Automatic video commentary systems are widely used on multimedia social media
platforms to extract factual information about video content. However, current
systems may overlook essential para-linguistic cues, including emotion and
attitude, which are critical for fully conveying the meaning of visual content.
The absence of these cues can limit user understanding or, in some cases,
distort the video's original intent. Expressive speech effectively conveys
these cues and enhances the user's comprehension of videos. Building on these
insights, this paper explores the usage of vision-context-aware expressive
speech in enhancing users' understanding of videos in video commentary systems.
Firstly, our formatting study indicates that semantic-only speech can lead to
ambiguity, and misaligned emotions between speech and visuals may distort
content interpretation. To address this, we propose a method called
vision-context-aware speech synthesis (V-CASS). It analyzes para-linguistic
cues from visuals using a vision-language model and leverages a
knowledge-infused language model to guide the expressive speech model in
generating context-aligned speech. User studies show that V-CASS enhances
emotional and attitudinal resonance, as well as user audio-visual understanding
and engagement, with 74.68% of participants preferring the system. Finally, we
explore the potential of our method in helping blind and low-vision users
navigate web videos, improving universal accessibility.

Motivation: 研究动机源于用户对社交媒体算法不可预测性的神秘化解读，及其对创作者内容和社区形成的影响。

Method: 通过访谈14位在TikTok上创作算法灵性内容的创作者，分析其创作过程和算法解读。

Result: 研究发现创作者的信仰与算法互动，强化了灵性或关系主题，并对观众产生情感影响。

Conclusion: 研究建议设计应支持创作者应对算法引发的灵性体验及管理相关挑战。

Abstract: Recent studies show that users often interpret social media algorithms as
mystical or spiritual because of their unpredictability. This invites new
questions about how such perceptions affect the content that creators create
and the communities they form online. In this study, 14 creators of algorithmic
conspirituality content on TikTok were interviewed to explore their
interpretations and creation processes influenced by the platform's For You
Page algorithm. We illustrate how creators' beliefs interact with TikTok's
algorithmic mediation to reinforce and shape their spiritual or relational
themes. Furthermore, we show how algorithmic conspirituality content impacts
viewers, highlighting its role in generating significant emotional and
affective labor for creators, stemming from complex relational dynamics
inherent in this content creation. We discuss implications for design to
support creators aimed at recognizing the unexpected spiritual and religious
experiences algorithms prompt, as well as supporting creators in effectively
managing these challenges.

Abstract: The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in K-6
project-based art courses presents both opportunities and challenges for
enhancing creativity, engagement, and group collaboration. This study
introduces a four-phase field study, involving in total two experienced K-6 art
teachers and 132 students in eight offline course sessions, to investigate the
usage and impact of GenAI. Specifically, based on findings in Phases 1 and 2,
we developed AskArt, an interactive interface that combines DALL-E and GPT and
is tailored to support elementary school students in their art projects, and
deployed it in Phases 3 and 4. Our findings revealed the benefits of GenAI in
providing background information, inspirations, and personalized guidance.
However, challenges in query formulation for generating expected content were
also observed. Moreover, students employed varied collaboration strategies, and
teachers noted increased engagement alongside concerns regarding misuse and
interface suitability. This study offers insights into the effective
integration of GenAI in elementary education, presents AskArt as a practical
tool, and provides recommendations for educators and researchers to enhance
project-based learning with GenAI technologies.

Motivation: 探讨多汁设计元素在交互式信息图表中对用户行为和记忆的影响。

Method: 比较多汁设计和干燥设计的用户参与度和信息保留效果，分析具体案例。

Result: 多汁设计在用户参与度上表现略好，但对信息保留的效果不一；某些情况下干燥设计更优。

Conclusion: 多汁设计能提升用户参与度，但需平衡清晰度和实用性，避免过度设计。

Abstract: This study compares the impact of "juiciness" on user engagement and
short-term information retention in interactive infographics. Juicy designs
generally showed a slight advantage in overall user engagement scores compared
to dry designs. Specifically, the juicy version of the Burcalories infographic
had the highest engagement score. However, the differences in engagement were
often small. Regarding information retention, the results were mixed. The juicy
versions of The Daily Routines of Famous Creative People and The Main Chakras
infographics showed marginally better average recall and more participants with
higher recall. Conversely, the dry version of Burcalories led to more correct
answers in multiple-choice questions. The study suggests that while juicy
design elements can enhance user engagement and, in some cases, short-term
information retention, their effectiveness depends on careful implementation.
Excessive juiciness could be overwhelming or distracting, while
well-implemented juicy elements contributed to a more entertaining experience.
The findings emphasize the importance of balancing engaging feedback with
clarity and usability.

Abstract: In this workshop paper, we discuss the potential for measures of user-centric
benefits (such as emotional well-being) that could be explored when evaluating
explainable AI (XAI) systems within the arts. As a background to this, we draw
from our recent review of creativity support tool (CST) evaluations, that found
a paucity of studies evaluating CSTs for user-centric measures that benefit the
user themselves. Specifically, we discuss measures of: (1) developing intrinsic
abilities, (2) emotional well-being, (3) self-reflection, and (4)
self-perception. By discussing these user-centric measures within the context
of XAI and the arts, we wish to provoke discussion regarding the potential of
such measures.

Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，其在线学习中的滥用问题引发担忧，但现有检测工具的可靠性参差不齐，且缺乏对滥用影响的评估。

Method: 定义LLM生成文本的标准，微调GPT-4o进行检测，并与GPTZero对比，同时评估滥用对学习的影响。

Result: 微调后的GPT-4o检测准确率达80%，F1分数0.78，优于GPTZero；滥用LLM的学习者在后续测试中表现异常。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLM检测提供了结构化方法，并建议结合辅助统计指标，同时公开数据和代码以支持后续研究。

Abstract: The increasing availability of large language models (LLMs) has raised
concerns about their potential misuse in online learning. While tools for
detecting LLM-generated text exist and are widely used by researchers and
educators, their reliability varies. Few studies have compared the accuracy of
detection methods, defined criteria to identify content generated by LLM, or
evaluated the effect on learner performance from LLM misuse within learning. In
this study, we define LLM-generated text within open responses as those
produced by any LLM without paraphrasing or refinement, as evaluated by human
coders. We then fine-tune GPT-4o to detect LLM-generated responses and assess
the impact on learning from LLM misuse. We find that our fine-tuned LLM
outperforms the existing AI detection tool GPTZero, achieving an accuracy of
80% and an F1 score of 0.78, compared to GPTZero's accuracy of 70% and macro F1
score of 0.50, demonstrating superior performance in detecting LLM-generated
responses. We also find that learners suspected of LLM misuse in the open
response question were more than twice as likely to correctly answer the
corresponding posttest MCQ, suggesting potential misuse across both question
types and indicating a bypass of the learning process. We pave the way for
future work by demonstrating a structured, code-based approach to improve
LLM-generated response detection and propose using auxiliary statistical
indicators such as unusually high assessment scores on related tasks,
readability scores, and response duration. In support of open science, we
contribute data and code to support the fine-tuning of similar models for
similar use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法过于关注攻击生成，忽略了基础特征表示的重要性。

Method: 提出AET框架，在对抗训练前加入ERM阶段，优化特征流形。

Result: AET在多个数据集和架构上表现优异，鲁棒性提升，训练成本降低8-25%。

Conclusion: 特征预条件化对高效鲁棒防御至关重要，AET为对抗训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants
overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger
attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple
yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM
phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and
effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or
superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training
costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets,
architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings
underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for
developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the
supplementary material.

Motivation: 公民集会的合法性依赖于其对广泛人群的代表性，但成员退出会导致不平衡，现有方法未考虑替补选择。

Method: 利用学习理论工具，基于历史数据估计退出概率，并选择替补以最小化预期的不代表性。

Result: 理论分析提供了样本复杂性和计算效率的保证，实证表明该方法显著提高了代表性且减少了替补需求。

Conclusion: 提出的算法框架有效解决了公民集会中的代表性问题，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: An increasingly influential form of deliberative democracy centers on
citizens' assemblies, where randomly selected people discuss policy questions.
The legitimacy of these panels hinges on their representation of the broader
population, but panelists often drop out, leading to an unbalanced composition.
Although participant attrition is mitigated in practice by alternates, their
selection is not taken into account by existing methods. To address this gap,
we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic
approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout
probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected
misrepresentation. We establish theoretical guarantees for our approach,
including worst-case bounds on sample complexity (with implications for
computational efficiency) and on loss when panelists' probabilities of dropping
out are mis-estimated. Empirical evaluation using real-world data demonstrates
that, compared to the status quo, our method significantly improves
representation while requiring fewer alternates.

Motivation: 在实际应用中，获取实例比例的精确监督信息具有挑战性，因此需要一种更贴合实际场景的学习框架。

Method: 提出MDPU框架，数学建模实例分布，基于ERM方法推导无偏风险估计器，并引入风险校正方法避免过拟合。

Result: 理论证明了无偏风险估计器的泛化误差界限，实验验证了MDPU在多数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: MDPU框架在LLP问题中表现出色，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where
multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information
about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications,
obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances
in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application
scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances
within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework
\emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of
instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number
of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we
derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable
overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced,
leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization
error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the
consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate
the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

Conclusion: 庄家可实现公平性与财务安全的平衡，算法高效且理论结果揭示了与Hermite多项式的关系。

Abstract: We study the Online Bookmaking problem, where a bookmaker dynamically updates
betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round, the
bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of
gamblers, aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show
that for any event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting
over all possible gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker's optimal
loss is the largest root of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that
bookmakers can be as fair as desired while avoiding financial risk, and the
explicit characterization reveals an intriguing relation between the
bookmaker's regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient algorithm
that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal gambler,
the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler is
suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the optimal opportunistic loss, a
notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical
contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the
Bellman-Pareto frontier, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for
Bellman's value function with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the
Pareto frontier in the context of vector repeated games.

Motivation: 针对特定领域的PDEs，设计一种计算资源需求低但效率高的模型，以解决传统PINNs参数过多的问题。

Method: 1. 通过预训练PINNs进行知识蒸馏，使用任务特定的激活函数；2. 在计算物理损失时进行智能降采样，大幅减少数据点数量。

Result: S$^2$GPT-PINN用远少于PINNs的参数实现了极高的计算效率。

Conclusion: S$^2$GPT-PINN为特定领域PDEs提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose S$^2$GPT-PINN, a sparse and small model for solving parametric
partial differential equations (PDEs). Similar to Small Language Models (SLMs),
S$^2$GPT-PINN is tailored to domain-specific (families of) PDEs and
characterized by its compact architecture and minimal computational power.
Leveraging a small amount of extremely high quality data via a mathematically
rigorous greedy algorithm that is enabled by the large full-order models,
S$^2$GPT-PINN relies on orders of magnitude less parameters than PINNs to
achieve extremely high efficiency via two levels of customizations. The first
is knowledge distillation via task-specific activation functions that are
transferred from Pre-Trained PINNs. The second is a judicious down-sampling
when calculating the physics-informed loss of the network compressing the
number of data sites by orders of magnitude to the size of the small model.

*John Lazarsfeld,Georgios Piliouras,Ryann Sim,Stratis Skoulakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了乐观虚构博弈在两人零和游戏中的学习性能，首次证明无正则化的乐观虚构博弈也能实现常数遗憾，并通过几何视角和能量函数分析其机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无正则化算法在零和游戏中的性能，验证乐观虚构博弈是否也能实现类似正则化算法的低遗憾。

Method: 采用乐观虚构博弈，通过双空间几何视角和能量函数分析其迭代过程。

Result: 证明乐观虚构博弈在双策略游戏中仅产生常数遗憾，同时证明交替虚构博弈的遗憾下界为Ω(√T)。

Conclusion: 乐观虚构博弈在无正则化条件下也能实现最优性能，而交替虚构博弈则无法达到次线性遗憾。

Abstract: This paper studies the optimistic variant of Fictitious Play for learning in
two-player zero-sum games. While it is known that Optimistic FTRL -- a
regularized algorithm with a bounded stepsize parameter -- obtains constant
regret in this setting, we show for the first time that similar, optimal rates
are also achievable without regularization: we prove for two-strategy games
that Optimistic Fictitious Play (using any tiebreaking rule) obtains only
constant regret, providing surprising new evidence on the ability of
non-no-regret algorithms for fast learning in games. Our proof technique
leverages a geometric view of Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of
payoff vectors, where we show a certain energy function of the iterates remains
bounded over time. Additionally, we also prove a regret lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for Alternating Fictitious Play. In the unregularized
regime, this separates the ability of optimism and alternation in achieving
$o(\sqrt{T})$ regret.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜂窝流量预测对运营商管理网络资源和决策至关重要，但流量的高度动态性和外部因素影响导致预测准确性下降。

Method: 提出两种变体的端到端框架，利用卷积神经网络和注意力机制捕捉空间动态，卡尔曼滤波建模时间动态，并利用辅助信息（如社交活动）提升性能。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，所提模型在预测准确性上优于现有机器学习技术。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效捕捉时空模式，结合辅助信息显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance for operators to manage
network resources and make decisions. Traffic is highly dynamic and influenced
by many exogenous factors, which would lead to the degradation of traffic
prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework with two
variants to explicitly characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of cellular
traffic among neighboring cells. It uses convolutional neural networks with an
attention mechanism to capture the spatial dynamics and Kalman filter for
temporal modelling. Besides, we can fully exploit the auxiliary information
such as social activities to improve prediction performance. We conduct
extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our
proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in
terms of prediction accuracy.

*Liulu He,Shenli Zhen,Karwei Sun,Yijiang Liu,Yufei Zhao,Chongkang Tan,Huanrui Yang,Yuan Du,Li Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了BASE-Q方法，通过结合偏置校正和非对称缩放，有效减少旋转量化中的舍入和裁剪误差，并支持分块优化，避免内存密集型全模型反向传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前旋转量化方法存在两个问题：(i) 旋转未能对齐通道均值，导致量化边界更宽和舍入误差增加；(ii) 旋转使激活分布更接近高斯分布，增加了裁剪误差的能量损失。

Method: 引入BASE-Q方法，结合偏置校正和非对称缩放，减少舍入和裁剪误差，并支持分块优化。

Result: 实验表明，BASE-Q将精度差距缩小了50.5%、42.9%和29.2%（相比QuaRot、SpinQuant和OSTQuant）。

Conclusion: BASE-Q是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了旋转量化的性能，并降低了内存需求。

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines
for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights
and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers
only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead:
due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to
enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited
practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of
current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel
means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors;
and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like,
increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we
introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias
correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping
errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the
need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing
the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\%
compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be
released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共互联网合成数据的使用增加，但模型崩溃的潜在威胁未被充分探索。

Method: 引入LWD框架，利用RAG数据库模拟互联网，分析模型输出的收敛模式，并通过高斯混合模型理论验证。

Result: 揭示了模型崩溃的网络级特征，并提供了理论收敛保证。

Conclusion: LWD框架为研究模型崩溃提供了有效工具，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced
data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the
potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing
studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely
solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics
(LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network
level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to
interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: 揭示了观测数据、动作和噪声结构对LAM学习的影响，并通过数值模拟验证。

Conclusion: 线性模型为LAM学习提供了理论支持，数据增强等策略有助于优化学习可控变化。

Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from
unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However,
differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well
as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the
changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue
analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM
learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including
connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of
the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage
learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and
auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on
numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations,
actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

Result: MLE-STAR在44%的Kaggle竞赛中表现优异，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MLE-STAR通过结合外部知识和精细化探索，为MLE代理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering
(MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However,
existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM
knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code
structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific
models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as
experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these,
we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first
leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective
models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it
by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This
exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual
code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an
effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that
MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench,
significantly outperforming the best alternative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型安全过滤器虽优于传统方法（如手工设计的CBFs），但缺乏形式化安全保证，因此需要一种可验证的无模型方法。

Method: 1）扩展Q值函数的可验证自一致性属性；2）提出乘法Q网络结构以减少零子集收缩问题；3）开发验证流程以验证自一致性。

Result: 方法在四个标准安全控制基准测试中成功生成了形式化验证的无模型安全证书。

Conclusion: 该研究为学习型安全过滤器提供了形式化安全保证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent learning-based safety filters have outperformed conventional methods,
such as hand-crafted Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), by effectively adapting
to complex constraints. However, these learning-based approaches lack formal
safety guarantees. In this work, we introduce a verifiable model-free safety
filter based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Our primary
contributions include: 1) extending verifiable self-consistency properties for
Q value functions, 2) proposing a multiplicative Q-network structure to
mitigate zero-sublevel-set shrinkage issues, and 3) developing a verification
pipeline capable of soundly verifying these self-consistency properties. Our
proposed approach successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety
certificates across four standard safe-control benchmarks.

Result: 在乳腺癌、帕金森病和慢性肾病数据集上的准确率分别为99.12%、94.87%和100%，优化时间减少约60%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了分类性能，优化效率高，适用于多种医学数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a framework that integrates nonlinear feature
extraction, classification, and efficient optimization. First, kernel principal
component analysis with a radial basis function kernel reduces dimensionality
while preserving 95% of the variance. Second, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
learns to predict disease status. Finally, a modified multiprocessing genetic
algorithm (MIGA) optimizes MLP hyperparameters in parallel over ten
generations. We evaluated this approach on three datasets: the Wisconsin
Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, the Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, and
the chronic kidney disease dataset. The MLP tuned by the MIGA achieved the best
accuracy of 99.12% for breast cancer, 94.87% for Parkinson's disease, and 100%
for chronic kidney disease. These results outperform those of other methods,
such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Compared with a
standard genetic algorithm, kernel PCA revealed nonlinear relationships that
improved classification, and the MIGA's parallel fitness evaluations reduced
the tuning time by approximately 60%. The genetic algorithm incurs high
computational cost from sequential fitness evaluations, but our multiprocessing
interface GA (MIGA) parallelizes this step, slashing the tuning time and
steering the MLP toward the best accuracy score of 99.12%, 94.87%, and 100% for
breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, and CKD, respectively.

Motivation: 语音信号高度可压缩，利用Transformer的自注意力机制可解释性，加速神经语音转录。

Method: 在Whisper模型上进行架构搜索，探索稀疏化阶段和压缩比的联合空间。

Result: 最佳方案在准确率下降1%内，隐藏状态稀疏化40-60%，实现1.6倍运行时加速。

Conclusion: 早期编码阶段的稀疏化可显著加速语音转录，无需微调。

Abstract: Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art
performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible,
here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal
sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the
interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders.
With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search
over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and
compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under
1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity
at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration
in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SimuGen通过多模态代理和领域知识，显著提升了Simulink仿真代码的生成能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still
struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models,
which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our
preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable
and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the
lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge,
we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically
generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual
Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized
agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator,
executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific
knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable,
robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is
publicly available at https://github.com/renxinxing123/SimuGen_beta.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖病理和基因组数据，忽略了表观遗传变化（如甲基化数据）和语言描述的潜力。论文首次探索了四种模态（包括语言）的联合使用。

Method: 提出CoC框架，包括内学习（临床数据编码为原始特征）和互学习（语言提示原始特征，引入自回归互牵引模块）。

Result: 在五个公共癌症数据集上验证了方法的有效性，取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: CoC框架通过多模态联合学习显著提升了生存预测性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Survival prediction aims to evaluate the risk level of cancer patients.
Existing methods primarily rely on pathology and genomics data, either
individually or in combination. From the perspective of cancer pathogenesis,
epigenetic changes, such as methylation data, could also be crucial for this
task. Furthermore, no previous endeavors have utilized textual descriptions to
guide the prediction. To this end, we are the first to explore the use of four
modalities, including three clinical modalities and language, for conducting
survival prediction. In detail, we are motivated by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
to propose the Chain-of-Cancer (CoC) framework, focusing on intra-learning and
inter-learning. We encode the clinical data as the raw features, which remain
domain-specific knowledge for intra-learning. In terms of inter-learning, we
use language to prompt the raw features and introduce an Autoregressive Mutual
Traction module for synergistic representation. This tailored framework
facilitates joint learning among multiple modalities. Our approach is evaluated
across five public cancer datasets, and extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our methods and proposed designs, leading to producing \sota
results. Codes will be released.

Motivation: 当前TTS系统在多语言环境下（尤其是印度语言）难以正确合成口音和上下文相关的情感，主要由于文化差异问题。

Method: 扩展Parler-TTS模型，集成语言特定音素对齐的混合编码器-解码器架构、文化敏感的情感嵌入层，以及动态口音代码切换技术。

Conclusion: 该系统通过可扩展的口音-情感解耦技术，为跨语言合成提供了更可行的解决方案，适用于南亚教育科技和辅助软件。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) systems realize high naturalness in
monolingual environments, synthesizing speech with correct multilingual accents
(especially for Indic languages) and context-relevant emotions still poses
difficulty owing to cultural nuance discrepancies in current frameworks. This
paper introduces a new TTS architecture integrating accent along with
preserving transliteration with multi-scale emotion modelling, in particularly
tuned for Hindi and Indian English accent. Our approach extends the Parler-TTS
model by integrating A language-specific phoneme alignment hybrid
encoder-decoder architecture, and culture-sensitive emotion embedding layers
trained on native speaker corpora, as well as incorporating a dynamic accent
code switching with residual vector quantization. Quantitative tests
demonstrate 23.7% improvement in accent accuracy (Word Error Rate reduction
from 15.4% to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition accuracy from native
listeners, surpassing METTS and VECL-TTS baselines. The novelty of the system
is that it can mix code in real time - generating statements such as "Namaste,
let's talk about <Hindi phrase>" with uninterrupted accent shifts while
preserving emotional consistency. Subjective evaluation with 200 users reported
a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness, much better than
existing multilingual systems (p<0.01). This research makes cross-lingual
synthesis more feasible by showcasing scalable accent-emotion disentanglement,
with direct application in South Asian EdTech and accessibility software.

Conclusion: Spotscape通过全局关系捕捉和距离调节，显著提升了空间转录组学分析的准确性。

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that
captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of
complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene
expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains.
However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot
representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they
heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an
anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that
introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships
between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy
to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating
effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice
and multi-slice scenarios. Our code is available at the following link: https:

Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘基准测试中遗忘与保留数据集差异过大，导致评估结果失真，可能掩盖模型在实际部署中的潜在风险。

Method: 提出BLUR基准测试，通过扩展评估任务、结合遗忘/保留查询以及提供不同难度的重新学习数据集，更真实地模拟遗忘与保留的重叠场景。

Result: 现有遗忘方法在BLUR上的表现显著下降，简单方法平均优于新方法，表明现有评估不够稳健。

Conclusion: BLUR为LLM遗忘研究提供了更真实的评估工具，并指出了未来研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language
models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key
challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively
unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good
performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM
unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets --
painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This
can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign
perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly
unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present
$\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic
scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on
existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined
forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of
difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that
the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on
$\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more
recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and
suggest several important directions of future study. Our benchmark is publicly

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合控制收缩度量（CCM）和强化学习（RL）的方法，称为收缩演员-评论家（CAC），以解决CCM在动态模型已知和长期最优性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCM虽然能保证闭环系统的增量指数稳定性，但缺乏对轨迹最优性的考虑，且依赖于已知动态模型和复杂的无限维凸可行性问题。

Method: 通过将CCM与RL结合，CAC算法学习收缩度量生成器（CMG）和最优跟踪策略，利用CCM提供动态信息反馈。

Result: 实验表明，CAC在模拟和真实机器人任务中优于基线方法，并提供了将收缩理论融入RL的理论依据。

Conclusion: CAC成功扩展了CCM的能力，实现了在未知动态下的长期最优控制。

Abstract: Control contraction metrics (CCMs) provide a framework to co-synthesize a
controller and a corresponding contraction metric -- a positive-definite
Riemannian metric under which a closed-loop system is guaranteed to be
incrementally exponentially stable. However, the synthesized controller only
ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single
trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an
entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics
model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex
feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring
high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to
integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide
dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize
cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,
called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs
to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in
a fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC
simultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a
contraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal
tracking policy guided by that metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm relative to established baselines through extensive empirical
studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, and provide a
theoretical rationale for incorporating contraction theory into RL.

advances leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
automating compiler tuning, two significant challenges still remain: the
absence of high-quality reasoning datasets for agents training, and limited
effective interactions with the compilation environment. In this work, we
introduce Compiler-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework
specifically augmenting LLM capabilities for compiler auto-tuning. Compiler-R1
features a curated, high-quality reasoning dataset and a novel two-stage
end-to-end RL training pipeline, enabling efficient environment exploration and
learning through an outcome-based reward. Extensive experiments across seven
datasets demonstrate Compiler-R1 achieving an average 8.46% IR instruction
count reduction compared to opt -Oz, showcasing the strong potential of
RL-trained LLMs for compiler optimization. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/Compiler-R1.

### [226] [Minifinetuning: Low-Data Generation Domain Adaptation through Corrective Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15702)
*Peter Belcak,Greg Heinrich,Jan Kautz,Pavlo Molchanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为minifinetuning（MFT）的方法，用于在低数据环境下减少语言模型微调时的性能退化问题，且无需预训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调语言模型在新领域时会导致其通用性能下降，尤其是在数据资源有限的情况下。

Method: MFT通过样本级别的自我蒸馏技术，减少过拟合引起的性能退化，并在低至500样本的情况下仍表现稳健。

Result: MFT在多种模型和领域中表现出比标准微调更好的性能，且能与参数高效微调方法结合使用。

Conclusion: MFT是一种高效且稳健的领域适应方法，特别适用于数据稀缺的场景。

Abstract: Finetuning language models for a new domain inevitably leads to the
deterioration of their general performance. This becomes more pronounced the
more limited the finetuning data resource.
  We introduce minifinetuning (MFT), a method for language model domain
adaptation that considerably reduces the effects of overfitting-induced
degeneralization in low-data settings and which does so in the absence of any
pre-training data for replay. MFT demonstrates 2-10x more favourable
specialization-to-degeneralization ratios than standard finetuning across a
wide range of models and domains and exhibits an intrinsic robustness to
overfitting when data in the new domain is scarce and down to as little as 500
samples.
  Employing corrective self-distillation that is individualized on the sample
level, MFT outperforms parameter-efficient finetuning methods, demonstrates
replay-like degeneralization mitigation properties, and is composable with
either for a combined effect.

*Guoqing Chao,Zhenghao Zhang,Lei Meng,Jie Wen,Dianhui Chu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦不完全多视图聚类方法FIMCFG，通过全局融合图指导解决现有方法在特征提取和缺失数据问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦多视图聚类方法仅使用全局伪标签指导聚类，未能充分利用全局信息，且对缺失数据问题研究较少。

Method: 设计双头图卷积编码器提取全局和视图特定特征，通过融合图指导特征融合，并在伪标签监督下进行聚类。

Result: 实验证明FIMCFG的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FIMCFG成功解决了现有方法的不足，并在联邦多视图聚类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Federated multi-view clustering has been proposed to mine the valuable
information within multi-view data distributed across different devices and has
achieved impressive results while preserving the privacy. Despite great
progress, most federated multi-view clustering methods only used global
pseudo-labels to guide the downstream clustering process and failed to exploit
the global information when extracting features. In addition, missing data
problem in federated multi-view clustering task is less explored. To address
these problems, we propose a novel Federated Incomplete Multi-view Clustering
method with globally Fused Graph guidance (FIMCFG). Specifically, we designed a
dual-head graph convolutional encoder at each client to extract two kinds of
underlying features containing global and view-specific information.
Subsequently, under the guidance of the fused graph, the two underlying
features are fused into high-level features, based on which clustering is
conducted under the supervision of pseudo-labeling. Finally, the high-level
features are uploaded to the server to refine the graph fusion and
pseudo-labeling computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of FIMCFG. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/PaddiHunter/FIMCFG.

*Feiyu Yao,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LFPS是一种基于历史注意力模式的稀疏索引加速方法，显著提升了长上下文LLM的解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决KV缓存内存需求大和稀疏注意力机制索引检索开销高的问题。

Method: 动态构建稀疏索引候选，利用历史注意力模式（垂直和斜线模式）和位置扩展策略预测Top-k索引。

Result: 在RTX 4090 GPU和Xeon Gold 6430 CPU上分别实现22.8倍和9.6倍加速，同时保持生成准确性。

Conclusion: LFPS为长上下文LLM推理提供了一种高效且实用的解码优化方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer
contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows
rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe
bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing
attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing
computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in
significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of
index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an
independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in
historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the
Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs
sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS
captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns
(attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative
positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively
predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging
long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as
the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$
speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval
on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively,
while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS
offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in
long-context LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TSFMs在无需训练定制模型的情况下预测宏观经济指标的潜力，为实践者提供零样本部署的指导。

Method: 在数据稀缺和结构断裂条件下，对三种先进TSFMs（Chronos、TimeGPT和Moirai）进行严格回测。

Result: TSFMs能够内化经济动态、适应制度变化，并在稳定条件下匹配或超越传统模型，但在快速冲击时期表现不佳。

Conclusion: TSFMs在零样本部署中具有潜力，但需注意其在经济快速变化时期的局限性。

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series
Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to
forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need
for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our
experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional
customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos,
TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our
results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich
economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved
uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art
multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any
fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic
conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during
periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when
zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic
planning.

TL;DR: Pieceformer是一个可扩展的自监督图相似性评估框架，用于VLSI设计中的知识转移，显著降低误差并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLSI设计中知识转移的准确性问题，以减少工程努力和缩短周转时间。

Method: 结合混合消息传递和图变换器编码器，采用线性变换器主干和分区训练管道以提高可扩展性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，MAE降低24.9%，并能正确聚类所有真实设计组；分区任务中实现89%的运行时减少。

Conclusion: Pieceformer在VLSI系统中实现了可扩展且无偏的设计重用，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurate graph similarity is critical for knowledge transfer in VLSI design,
enabling the reuse of prior solutions to reduce engineering effort and
turnaround time. We propose Pieceformer, a scalable, self-supervised similarity
assessment framework, equipped with a hybrid message-passing and graph
transformer encoder. To address transformer scalability, we incorporate a
linear transformer backbone and introduce a partitioned training pipeline for
efficient memory and parallelism management. Evaluations on synthetic and
real-world CircuitNet datasets show that Pieceformer reduces mean absolute
error (MAE) by 24.9% over the baseline and is the only method to correctly
cluster all real-world design groups. We further demonstrate the practical
usage of our model through a case study on a partitioning task, achieving up to
89% runtime reduction. These results validate the framework's effectiveness for
scalable, unbiased design reuse in modern VLSI systems.

*Yunze Lin*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多粒度直接偏好优化（MDPO）方法，通过三个粒度优化LLMs的数学推理能力，并在实验中优于DPO及其变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在数学推理中容易产生幻觉，现有方法如DPO在长链推理中效果有限。

Method: 提出MDPO方法，在Solution2Solution、Inference2Inference和Step2Step三个粒度上优化，并统一训练目标。

Result: 在Qwen2和Llama3模型上，GSM8K和MATH数据集上性能提升显著。

Conclusion: MDPO方法有效提升了LLMs的数学推理能力，并提供了低成本的数据构建流程。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs) as it requires ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step.
Researchers have been strengthening the mathematical reasoning abilities of
LLMs through supervised fine-tuning, but due to the inability to suppress
incorrect outputs, illusions can easily arise. Recently, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using
preference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs. However, it
has shown limited benefits in long-chain mathematical reasoning, mainly because
DPO struggles to effectively capture the differences between accepted and
rejected answers from preferences in long-chain data. The inconsistency between
DPO training and LLMs' generation metrics also affects the effectiveness of
suppressing incorrect outputs. We propose the Multi-Granularity Direct
Preference Optimization (MDPO) method, optimizing the mathematical reasoning of
LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and
Step2Step. Solution2Solution focuses on the correctness of entire long-chain
reasoning; Inference2Inference concentrates on logical reasoning between steps;
Step2Step corrects computational errors in steps, enhancing the computational
capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we unify the training objectives of the
three granularities to align with the generation metrics. We conducted
experiments on the open-source models Qwen2 and Llama3, achieving improvements
of 1.7% and 0.9% on the GSM8K dataset, and 2.3% and 1.2% on the MATH dataset,
outperforming DPO and other DPO variant methods. Furthermore, we also provide a
pipeline for constructing MDPO training data that is simple and does not
require manual annotation costs.

Motivation: 黑盒系统辨识模型缺乏对系统动态的可解释性，需要一种平衡准确性和可解释性的方法。

Method: 提出SS-KAN模型，利用稀疏正则化和单变量函数可视化，增强可解释性。

Result: 在Silverbox和Wiener-Hammerstein基准测试中，SS-KAN展示了更好的可解释性，但准确性略低于先进黑盒模型。

Conclusion: SS-KAN是一种有前景的模型，平衡了非线性系统辨识的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: While accurate, black-box system identification models lack interpretability
of the underlying system dynamics. This paper proposes State-Space
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SS-KAN) to address this challenge by integrating
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within a state-space framework. The proposed model
is validated on two benchmark systems: the Silverbox and the Wiener-Hammerstein
benchmarks. Results show that SS-KAN provides enhanced interpretability due to
sparsity-promoting regularization and the direct visualization of its learned
univariate functions, which reveal system nonlinearities at the cost of
accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art black-box models, highlighting
SS-KAN as a promising approach for interpretable nonlinear system
identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability of nonlinear system
dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DORA的资源分配方法，用于优化大型语言模型（LLMs）在测试时的搜索效率，通过方向级别的资源分配提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时搜索方法在资源分配上效率低下，倾向于支持候选数量多的推理方向，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 将测试时搜索建模为资源分配问题，提出DORA方法，通过方向级别的资源分配优化搜索效率。

Result: 在MATH500、AIME2024和AIME2025等数学推理基准测试中，DORA表现优于基线方法，达到最优准确率。

Conclusion: DORA通过优化资源分配策略，显著提升了LLMs在测试时的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple
reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most
effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient
use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search
as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy
that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed
rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of
existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning
directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and
inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented
Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias
by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources
at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct
extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks
including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA
consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a
broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

Motivation: 现有GNN框架未充分考虑脑区间的因果关系，而因果关系比传统相关性更能揭示信号间的因果交互。

Method: 结合因果发现方法（转移熵）和几何曲率策略，构建因果图并进行图重连。

Result: CGB在脑疾病分类任务中表现优于现有方法，F1分数更高。

Conclusion: CGB通过建模因果关系和优化图结构，显著提升了脑疾病分类的准确性和表达能力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to model the relationship
between regions of interest (ROIs) in brains and have shown significant
improvement in detecting brain diseases. However, most of these frameworks do
not consider the intrinsic relationship of causality factor between brain ROIs,
which is arguably more essential to observe cause and effect interaction
between signals rather than typical correlation values. We propose a novel
framework called CGB (Causal Graphs for Brains) for brain disease
classification/detection, which models refined brain networks based on the
causal discovery method, transfer entropy, and geometric curvature strategy.
CGB unveils causal relationships between ROIs that bring vital information to
enhance brain disease classification performance. Furthermore, CGB also
performs a graph rewiring through a geometric curvature strategy to refine the
generated causal graph to become more expressive and reduce potential
information bottlenecks when GNNs model it. Our extensive experiments show that
CGB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain
disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a central challenge in machine learning (ML),
especially in collaborative eScience projects where teams iterate over data,
features, and models. Current ML workflows are often dynamic yet fragmented,
relying on informal data sharing, ad hoc scripts, and loosely connected tools.
This fragmentation impedes transparency, reproducibility, and the adaptability
of experiments over time. This paper introduces a data-centric framework for
lifecycle-aware reproducibility, centered around six structured artifacts:
Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, and Controlled Vocabulary. These
artifacts formalize the relationships between data, code, and decisions,
enabling ML experiments to be versioned, interpretable, and traceable over
time. The approach is demonstrated through a clinical ML use case of glaucoma
detection, illustrating how the system supports iterative exploration, improves
reproducibility, and preserves the provenance of collaborative decisions across
the ML lifecycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNNs）在网络模体SP预测方面缺乏研究，且没有基准测试。论文旨在填补这一空白，将SP估计独立于子图频率估计。

Method: 将SP估计重新定义为多目标回归问题，直接从图中学习SP，而非依赖子图频率计数。方法优化了可解释性、稳定性和大规模图的可扩展性。

Result: 实验表明，1-WL受限模型在精确估计SP方面表现不佳，但能通过比较预测SP与合成生成器的SP，近似网络生成过程。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于GNN的模体估计研究，表明直接SP估计可以突破子图计数带来的理论限制。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph
representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their
application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains
under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to
address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph
frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP
estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The
reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on
large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and
further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited
models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can
generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by
comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic
generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how
using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that
motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

Result: 实验表明，RAST显著提升了基础模型的推理能力，且计算资源需求远低于直接RL训练，有时性能甚至优于RL训练模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RL驱动推理的本质，并提供了一种无需高计算成本的实用策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful approach for improving the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent
successes such as OpenAI's o1 and Deepseek-R1. However, applying RL at scale
remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and
extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent
studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge;
rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate
reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we
hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely
model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a
small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger
base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of
decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output
distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by
this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning
behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small
RL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the
reasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU
memory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than
the RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of
RL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without
incurring its full computational cost. The project page of RAST is available at

Motivation: 联邦学习中梯度反转攻击可能导致隐私泄露，现有防御方法缺乏针对性，影响模型准确性或保护不足。

Method: 利用可解释的影子模型识别敏感区域，进行样本特定的噪声注入。

Result: 在ChestXRay和EyePACS数据集上，PSNR和SSIM指标显著优于无防御情况，模型性能损失小于1%。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种医疗图像上验证了通用性，能有效防御不同类型的梯度反转攻击，尤其保护图像敏感区域。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for
privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively
train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially
crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is
paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the
communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries.
Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to
approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images,
thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients,
yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image
information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate
calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection
degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive
information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these
challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying
sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise
injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in
PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the
ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover,
it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1
reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across
diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed
framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over
1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against
various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

Conclusion: 验证了BERT风格预训练在时间序列故障检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate fault detection in lithium-ion batteries is essential for the safe
and reliable operation of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex temporal
dependencies and cannot fully leverage abundant unlabeled data. Although large
language models (LLMs) exhibit strong representation capabilities, their
architectures are not directly suited to the numerical time-series data common
in industrial settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that adapts BERT-style pretraining for battery fault detection by
extending the standard BERT architecture with a customized time-series-to-token
representation module and a point-level Masked Signal Modeling (point-MSM)
pretraining task tailored to battery applications. This approach enables
self-supervised learning on sequential current, voltage, and other
charge-discharge cycle data, yielding distributionally robust, context-aware
temporal embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings with battery metadata
and feed them into a downstream classifier for accurate fault classification.
Experimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset show that models
initialized with our pretrained parameters significantly improve both
representation quality and classification accuracy, achieving an AUROC of 0.945
and substantially outperforming existing approaches. These findings validate
the effectiveness of BERT-style pretraining for time-series fault detection.

in 400 m water depth. We developed a machine learning workflow combining a
gradient-boosted ensemble method with a custom passive weathervaning solver,
trained on approximately $10^6$ samples spanning 100 features. The model
achieved mean prediction errors of less than 5% for critical mooring parameters
and vessel heading accuracy to within 2.5 degrees across diverse metocean
conditions, significantly outperforming traditional frequency-domain methods.
The framework has been successfully deployed on an operational facility,
demonstrating its efficacy for real-time vessel monitoring and operational
decision-making in offshore environments.

*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的双短时拉普拉斯变换（STLT）机制，替代传统Transformer中的自注意力，实现动态调整token相关性和频率响应，支持超长序列建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自注意力机制在长序列建模中存在计算瓶颈，STLT通过可学习参数和自适应节点分配，提供了一种可解释且高效的方法。

Method: 引入可训练的拉普拉斯节点参数，结合快速递归卷积和FFT计算，动态调整节点数量和带宽，实现高效复杂度。

Result: 在语言建模、机器翻译和长文档问答任务中，STLT性能与现有高效Transformer相当或更优，支持超过100k tokens的上下文长度。

Conclusion: STLT结合了可解释性、可扩展性和鲁棒性，为超长序列语言建模提供了一种无需自注意力计算瓶颈的新途径。

Abstract: We propose an innovative, learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform
(STLT) mechanism to supplant the traditional self attention in
transformer-based LLMs. Our STLT introduces trainable parameters for each
Laplace node, enabling end-to-end learning of decay rates , oscillatory
frequencies, and window bandwidth T. This flexibility allows the model to
dynamically adapt token relevance half lives and frequency responses during
training. By selecting S learnable nodes and leveraging fast recursive
convolution, we achieve an effective complexity of in time and memory. We
further incorporate an efficient FFT-based computation of the relevance matrix
and an adaptive node allocation mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of
active Laplace nodes. Empirical results on language modeling (WikiText\-103,
Project Gutenberg), machine translation (WMT'14 En\-De), and long document
question answering (NarrativeQA) demonstrate that our learnable STLT achieves
perplexities and scores on par with or better than existing efficient
transformers while naturally extending to context lengths exceeding 100k tokens
or more limited only by available hardware. Ablation studies confirm the
importance of learnable parameters and adaptive node allocation. The proposed
approach combines interpretability, through explicit decay and frequency
parameters, with scalability and robustness, offering a pathway towards
ultra-long-sequence language modeling without the computational bottleneck of
self-attention.

Result: NeuronSeek-TD框架在稳定性和性能上优于现有模型，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 张量分解为任务驱动神经元优化提供了更稳定高效的解决方案，理论支持其广泛适用性。

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from our human brain that designs different neurons for
different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a
network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping
task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression
(SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from
these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic
regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal
formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore,
we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions
with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of
parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small
error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek
framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD
framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive
relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks. The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为daDPO（Distribution-Aware DPO）的方法，通过结合偏好优化和基于分布的蒸馏，显著提升了小型语言模型的对话能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限环境中表现不佳，现有知识蒸馏方法忽视教师模型的输出分布信息。

Method: 引入daDPO方法，结合偏好优化和分布蒸馏，利用教师模型的输出分布提升小型模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，daDPO在修剪模型和小型LLM上表现优于现有方法，例如修剪后的Vicuna1.5-7B性能接近教师模型，Qwen2.5-1.5B甚至偶尔超越7B教师模型。

Conclusion: daDPO为资源受限环境中的LLM部署提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了小型模型的对话能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as
model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct
Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model.
However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the
teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the
teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware
DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based
distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical
validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring
performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in
in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve
near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's
-31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model
(14.0% win rate).

Motivation: 解决3D建筑自动生成研究中缺乏大规模、高质量标注数据集的问题。

Result: 训练了两个轻量级PointNet基线模型，分别用于多属性回归和缺陷检测，结果显示数据集具有学习潜力但仍有挑战。

Conclusion: BuildingBRep-11K是一个可学习但非简单的数据集，适用于几何和拓扑任务。

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence, the automatic generation of
building-scale 3-D objects has become an active research topic, yet training
such models still demands large, clean and richly annotated datasets. We
introduce BuildingBRep-11K, a collection of 11 978 multi-storey (2-10 floors)
buildings (about 10 GB) produced by a shape-grammar-driven pipeline that
encodes established building-design principles. Every sample consists of a
geometrically exact B-rep solid-covering floors, walls, slabs and rule-based
openings-together with a fast-loading .npy metadata file that records detailed
per-floor parameters. The generator incorporates constraints on spatial scale,
daylight optimisation and interior layout, and the resulting objects pass
multi-stage filters that remove Boolean failures, undersized rooms and extreme
aspect ratios, ensuring compliance with architectural standards. To verify the
dataset's learnability we trained two lightweight PointNet baselines. (i)
Multi-attribute regression. A single encoder predicts storey count, total
rooms, per-storey vector and mean room area from a 4 000-point cloud. On 100
unseen buildings it attains 0.37-storey MAE (87 \% within $\pm1$), 5.7-room
MAE, and 3.2 m$^2$ MAE on mean area. (ii) Defect detection. With the same
backbone we classify GOOD versus DEFECT; on a balanced 100-model set the
network reaches 54 \% accuracy, recalling 82 \% of true defects at 53 \%
precision (41 TP, 9 FN, 37 FP, 13 TN). These pilots show that BuildingBRep-11K
is learnable yet non-trivial for both geometric regression and topological
quality assessment

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统热泵控制方法效率有限，机器学习在热水需求预测中的应用尚未充分研究，因此需要一种更智能的解决方案。

Method: 结合机器学习（LightGBM、LSTM、BiLSTM）和隔离森林（iForest），通过多步特征选择和高级时间序列分析，预测热水需求并优化热泵操作。

Result: LightGBM表现最佳，RMSE提升9.37%，iForest异常检测F1-score为0.87，误报率仅5.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实家庭环境中表现出色，适用于实际热泵部署。

Abstract: Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a cost-effective and clean technology for
sustainable energy systems, but their efficiency in producing hot water remains
restricted by conventional threshold-based control methods. Although machine
learning (ML) has been successfully implemented for various HP applications,
optimization of household hot water demand forecasting remains understudied.
This paper addresses this problem by introducing a novel approach that combines
predictive ML with anomaly detection to create adaptive hot water production
strategies based on household-specific consumption patterns. Our key
contributions include: (1) a composite approach combining ML and isolation
forest (iForest) to forecast household demand for hot water and steer
responsive HP operations; (2) multi-step feature selection with advanced
time-series analysis to capture complex usage patterns; (3) application and
tuning of three ML models: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM with the self-attention
mechanism on data from different types of real HP installations; and (4)
experimental validation on six real household installations. Our experiments
show that the best-performing model LightGBM achieves superior performance,
with RMSE improvements of up to 9.37\% compared to LSTM variants with $R^2$
values between 0.748-0.983. For anomaly detection, our iForest implementation
achieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a false alarm rate of only 5.2\%,
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different household
types and consumption patterns, making it suitable for real-world HP
deployments.

Motivation: 固定特征提取器限制了模型对新类的适应性，导致灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题。

Method: 提出Tri-WE方法，在权重空间中插值基础模型、前一个模型和当前模型，并结合放大数据知识蒸馏正则化损失。

Result: 在miniImageNet、CUB200和CIFAR100数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了FSCIL中的灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of
new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes
substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and
overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to
disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of
the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many
examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental
learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's
adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively
address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to
seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a
tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base,
immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the
classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains
knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the
challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model
from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified
data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can
produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the
previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the
miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

Motivation: 现有异构LLM融合方法依赖有限领域数据和固定数据分配比例，导致目标LLM无法全面获取多样领域的知识，并出现能力不平衡问题。

Method: Bohdi通过层次化知识树和多模型协作生成合成数据，将领域扩展和数据采样比例分配形式化为层次化多臂老虎机问题，并利用DynaBranches机制动态调整采样比例。结合Introspection-Rebirth机制，通过滑动窗口二项似然比测试跟踪能力变化。

Conclusion: Bohdi通过合成数据和动态调整机制，有效解决了异构LLM融合中的领域限制和能力不平衡问题。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of
multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low
computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major
limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion,
preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse
domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to
dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across
domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework.
Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree
structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data
generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively
extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data
sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical
Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism
to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance
feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth
(IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target
LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT),
further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental
results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi
significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits
higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target
LLM's capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现实应用场景要求机器学习模型同时考虑机械超材料设计中的三种模态，但现有研究大多仅关注其中两种，因此需要一种统一模型来解决这一问题。

Conclusion: UNIMATE填补了现有研究的空白，并在多个任务中表现出色，已开源模型和结果。

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificial materials that are designed to meet unseen
properties in nature, such as ultra-stiffness and negative materials indices.
In mechanical metamaterial design, three key modalities are typically involved,
i.e., 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property. Real-world
complex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine
learning models to consider all three modalities together. However, a
comprehensive literature review indicates that most existing works only
consider two modalities, e.g., predicting mechanical properties given the 3D
topology or generating 3D topology given the required properties. Therefore,
there is still a significant gap for the state-of-the-art machine learning
models capturing the whole. Hence, we propose a unified model named UNIMATE,
which consists of a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion
generation module. Experiments indicate that UNIMATE outperforms the other
baseline models in topology generation task, property prediction task, and
condition confirmation task by up to 80.2%, 5.1%, and 50.2%, respectively. We

Method: MadaKV通过模态偏好适应和分层压缩补偿两个关键组件，动态感知注意力头中的模态信息并自适应保留关键令牌。

Result: MadaKV显著减少了KV缓存内存占用和模型推理解码延迟（提升1.3至1.5倍），同时在多模态长上下文任务中保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 实验证明MadaKV在MLLMs和MileBench基准测试中优于现有KV缓存淘汰方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache
eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios,
attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting
in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads.
Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal
settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding
suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key
components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression
compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention
heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial
reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency
(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various
multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs
and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to
existing KV cache eviction methods.

Motivation: 现有基于DDPMs的图生成模型无法在扩散过程中调整分子大小，限制了其在条件生成（如属性驱动分子设计）中的应用。

Method: 通过重新定义噪声和去噪过程，支持节点的单调插入和删除，实现了动态调整分子大小的GrIDDD模型。

Result: GrIDDD在分子属性目标生成中表现优于现有图扩散模型，并在分子优化中展现出竞争力。

Conclusion: GrIDDD为尺寸自适应的分子生成提供了新思路，推动了图扩散模型的发展。

Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular
generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom
and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited
by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms)
during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in
conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design,
where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this
paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic
insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD,
dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD
matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on
molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem.
Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits
competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work
paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.

Abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of molecular properties with machine learning is
pivotal to scientific advancements across myriad domains. Foundation models in
particular have proven especially effective, enabling accurate training on
small, real-world datasets. This study introduces CheMeleon, a novel molecular
foundation model pre-trained on deterministic molecular descriptors from the
Mordred package, leveraging a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network to
predict these descriptors in a noise-free setting. Unlike conventional
approaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical
simulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich
molecular representations. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and
MoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks,
outperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop
(36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%)
and other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity
cliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's
learned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series,
highlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results
underscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and
effective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further
exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets.

Conclusion: DeepJ为患者风险分层提供了更优的建模工具，同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph learning has gained significant interest for modeling
complex interactions among medical events in structured Electronic Health
Record (EHR) data. However, existing graph-based approaches often work in a
static manner, either restricting interactions within individual encounters or
collapsing all historical encounters into a single snapshot. As a result, when
it is necessary to identify meaningful groups of medical events spanning
longitudinal encounters, existing methods are inadequate in modeling
interactions cross encounters while accounting for temporal dependencies. To
address this limitation, we introduce Deep Patient Journey (DeepJ), a novel
graph convolutional transformer model with differentiable graph pooling to
effectively capture intra-encounter and inter-encounter medical event
interactions. DeepJ can identify groups of temporally and functionally related
medical events, offering valuable insights into key event clusters pertinent to
patient outcome prediction. DeepJ significantly outperformed five
state-of-the-art baseline models while enhancing interpretability,
demonstrating its potential for improved patient risk stratification.

Conclusion: FedWB和HFRL算法在分布式和异构环境下表现良好，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a novel algorithm for model fusion that
leverages Wasserstein barycenters in training a global Deep Neural Network
(DNN) in a distributed architecture. To this end, we divide the dataset into
equal parts that are fed to "agents" who have identical deep neural networks
and train only over the dataset fed to them (known as the local dataset). After
some training iterations, we perform an aggregation step where we combine the
weight parameters of all neural networks using Wasserstein barycenters. These
steps form the proposed algorithm referred to as FedWB. Moreover, we leverage
the processes created in the first part of the paper to develop an algorithm to
tackle Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL). Our test
experiment is the CartPole toy problem, where we vary the lengths of the poles
to create heterogeneous environments. We train a deep Q-Network (DQN) in each
environment to learn to control each cart, while occasionally performing a
global aggregation step to generalize the local models; the end outcome is a
global DQN that functions across all environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于XGBoost集成学习的现场传感器校准模型，用于提高低成本传感器的精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模空气质量监测需要分布式传感，但高精度传感器成本高，而低成本传感器易受环境因素影响，导致数据漂移。

Method: 使用XGBoost集成学习整合邻近传感器数据，减少对单个传感器精度的依赖。

Result: 模型提高了传感器数据的准确性和跨位置泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本传感器在大规模空气质量监测中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Effective large-scale air quality monitoring necessitates distributed sensing
due to the pervasive and harmful nature of particulate matter (PM),
particularly in urban environments. However, precision comes at a cost: highly
accurate sensors are expensive, limiting the spatial deployments and thus their
coverage. As a result, low-cost sensors have become popular, though they are
prone to drift caused by environmental sensitivity and manufacturing
variability. This paper presents a model for in-field sensor calibration using
XGBoost ensemble learning to consolidate data from neighboring sensors. This
approach reduces dependence on the presumed accuracy of individual sensors and
improves generalization across different locations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络常产生过度自信的预测，其不确定性估计与人类感知的差异在关键应用中带来挑战。

Method: 通过三个视觉基准数据集，比较模型预测的不确定性与人类标注的不确定性之间的相关性。

Result: 当前方法与人类直觉的关联较弱，但引入人类软标签可提升校准性且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: 模型与人类不确定性存在差距，利用人类洞察可开发更可信的AI系统。

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often achieve high predictive accuracy but
remain poorly calibrated, producing overconfident predictions even when wrong.
This miscalibration poses serious challenges in applications where reliable
uncertainty estimates are critical. In this work, we investigate how human
perceptual uncertainty compares to uncertainty estimated by NNs. Using three
vision benchmarks annotated with both human disagreement and crowdsourced
confidence, we assess the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and
human-perceived uncertainty. Our results show that current methods only weakly
align with human intuition, with correlations varying significantly across
tasks and uncertainty metrics. Notably, we find that incorporating
human-derived soft labels into the training process can improve calibration
without compromising accuracy. These findings reveal a persistent gap between
model and human uncertainty and highlight the potential of leveraging human
insights to guide the development of more trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary RF Model)通过强制边界条件改进Rectified Flow，显著提升生成模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接建模速度场时，未约束的神经网络可能无法满足边界条件，导致速度场估计不准确，尤其在边界附近误差放大。

Method: 提出Boundary RF Model，通过最小代码修改强制边界条件。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ODE采样FID分数提升8.01%，SDE采样提升8.98%。

Conclusion: Boundary RF Model有效解决了边界条件问题，显著提升了生成模型的质量。

Abstract: Rectified Flow offers a simple and effective approach to high-quality
generative modeling by learning a velocity field. However, we identify a
limitation in directly modeling the velocity with an unconstrained neural
network: the learned velocity often fails to satisfy certain boundary
conditions, leading to inaccurate velocity field estimations that deviate from
the desired ODE. This issue is particularly critical during stochastic sampling
at inference, as the score function's errors are amplified near the boundary.
To mitigate this, we propose a Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary
RF Model), in which we enforce boundary conditions with a minimal code
modification. Boundary RF Model improves performance over vanilla RF model,
demonstrating 8.01% improvement in FID score on ImageNet using ODE sampling and
8.98% improvement using SDE sampling.

Method: 引入POLCA方法，在低秩训练子空间中沿任意基分解损失变化，识别样本聚类。

Result: POLCA成功识别了模型能力中的可解释突破，验证了其在合成和自然语言任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 隐藏的相变可作为无监督可解释性工具，POLCA为理解学习动态提供了新途径。

Abstract: Loss curves are smooth during most of model training, so visible
discontinuities stand out as possible conceptual breakthroughs. Studying these
breakthroughs enables a deeper understanding of learning dynamics, but only
when they are properly identified. This paper argues that similar breakthroughs
occur frequently throughout training but they are obscured by a loss metric
that collapses all variation into a single scalar. To find these hidden
transitions, we introduce POLCA, a method for decomposing changes in loss along
arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace. We use our method to
identify clusters of samples that share similar changes in loss during
training, disaggregating the overall loss into that of smaller groups of
conceptually similar data. We validate our method on synthetic arithmetic and
natural language tasks, showing that POLCA recovers clusters that represent
interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. We demonstrate the
promise of these hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised
interpretability.

classification, clustering, and natural language processing (NLP) for
text-based feature extraction and representation, this study aims to uncover
the key features influencing job market dynamics and provide valuable insights
for job seekers, employers, and researchers. Exploratory data analysis was
conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, regression
models were developed to predict salaries, classification models to predict job
titles, and clustering techniques were applied to group similar jobs. The
analyses revealed significant factors influencing salary and job roles, and
identified distinct job clusters based on the provided data. While the results
are based on synthetic data and not intended for real-world deployment, the
methodology demonstrates a transferable framework for job market analysis.

Conclusion: T-SHRED结合Transformer和SINDy注意力机制，显著提升了预测性能和模型可解释性。

Abstract: SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) are effective for system identification
and forecasting from sparse sensor measurements. Such models are light-weight
and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops.
SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding
respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able
to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and
temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this
work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal
encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large
datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression
directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture.
Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and
regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the
performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from
low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED
accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model
across all tested datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法（如Best-of-N、多数投票等）对输入统一处理，忽略了问题所需的推理深度差异。

Method: 提取与深度推理相关的潜在导向向量，并通过可调缩放因子动态调整推理强度。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH500和GPQA等任务上，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Fractional Reasoning为测试时计算提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs
or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However,
existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically
apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that
different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this
work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic
framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference
time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method
operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper
reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports
two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in
breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing
the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g.,
self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that
Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning
tasks and models.

Result: 揭示了对比样本学习与自导向学习模型的联系，并通过几何概念类和布尔函数类验证结果。

Conclusion: 对比样本能显著影响学习效率，且与自导向学习存在理论关联。

Abstract: Machine learning can greatly benefit from providing learning algorithms with
pairs of contrastive training examples -- typically pairs of instances that
differ only slightly, yet have different class labels. Intuitively, the
difference in the instances helps explain the difference in the class labels.
This paper proposes a theoretical framework in which the effect of various
types of contrastive examples on active learners is studied formally. The focus
is on the sample complexity of learning concept classes and how it is
influenced by the choice of contrastive examples. We illustrate our results
with geometric concept classes and classes of Boolean functions. Interestingly,
we reveal a connection between learning from contrastive examples and the
classical model of self-directed learning.

Abstract: Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in
agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission
mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of
advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are
challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a
result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application
of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This
research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that
addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an
agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques.
Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and
generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a
wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and
integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process,
we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and
multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the
autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the
agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network
to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict
fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world
agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with
well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability
in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.

Motivation: 随着位置跟踪技术的普及，轨迹数据量激增，但现有学习方法在语义对齐、噪声鲁棒性和全局排序信息利用方面存在不足。

Method: TrajDiff框架包含语义对齐模块（跨注意力和自适应融合）、基于DDBM的噪声鲁棒预训练和全局排序感知正则化。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，TrajDiff显著优于现有方法，平均HR@1提升33.38%。

Conclusion: TrajDiff通过语义对齐、噪声鲁棒性和全局排序优化，有效提升了轨迹相似性计算的性能。

Abstract: With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of
trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in
trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role
in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based
methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS
and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful
trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well
as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion
patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on
point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking
information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity
to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a
novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff.
Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an
attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating
semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified
representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training
introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model
training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall
ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global
perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among
trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show
that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In
particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three
evaluation metrics and datasets.

28-day mortality in ICU patients with concurrent DM and AF using early-phase
clinical data.
  Methods: A retrospective cohort of 1,535 adult ICU patients with DM and AF
was extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. Data preprocessing involved
median/mode imputation, z-score normalization, and early temporal feature
engineering. A two-step feature selection pipeline-univariate filtering (ANOVA

CI: 0.779-0.867), surpassing more complex models. Key predictors included RAS,
age, bilirubin, and extubation. ALE plots showed intuitive, non-linear effects
such as age-related risk acceleration and bilirubin thresholds.
  Conclusion: This interpretable ML model offers accurate risk prediction and
clinical insights for early ICU triage in patients with DM and AF.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态融合的优势和机制，为神经机器人系统的传感器设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Hand gestures are a primary output of the human motor system, yet the
decoding of their neuromuscular signatures remains a bottleneck for basic
neuroscience and assistive technologies such as prosthetics. Traditional
human-machine interface pipelines rely on a single biosignal modality, but
multimodal fusion can exploit complementary information from sensors. We
systematically compare linear and attention-based fusion strategies across
three architectures: a Multimodal MLP, a Multimodal Transformer, and a
Hierarchical Transformer, evaluating performance on scenarios with unimodal and
multimodal inputs. Experiments use two publicly available datasets: NinaPro DB2
(sEMG and accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (high-density sEMG and force).
Across both datasets, the Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion
consistently achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing the multimodal and best
single-modality linear-fusion MLP baseline by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7%
on HD-sEMG. To investigate how modalities interact, we introduce an Isolation
Network that selectively silences unimodal or cross-modal attention pathways,
quantifying each group of token interactions' contribution to downstream
decisions. Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute
approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers,
highlighting the importance of attention-driven fusion in harnessing
complementary modality information. Together, these findings reveal when and
how multimodal fusion would enhance biosignal classification and also provides
mechanistic insights of human muscle activities. The study would be beneficial
in the design of sensor arrays for neurorobotic systems.

Abstract: Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods designed to handle
adversarial input observations have received significant attention, motivated
by RL's inherent vulnerabilities. While existing approaches have demonstrated
reasonable success, addressing worst-case scenarios over long time horizons
requires both minimizing the agent's cumulative rewards for adversaries and
training agents to counteract them through alternating learning. However, this
process introduces mutual dependencies between the agent and the adversary,
making interactions with the environment inefficient and hindering the
development of off-policy methods. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy
method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by
reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem.
Our approach is theoretically supported by the symmetric property of policy
evaluation between the agent and the adversary. The implementation is available
at https://github.com/nakanakakosuke/VALT_SAC.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging
diverse datasets from multiple sources while preserving data privacy by
avoiding centralized storage. However, many existing approaches fail to account
for the intricate gradient correlations between remote clients, a limitation
that becomes especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios. In this
work, we propose a novel FL framework utilizing Power-Norm Cosine Similarity
(PNCS) to improve client selection for model aggregation. By capturing
higher-order gradient moments, PNCS addresses non-IID data challenges,
enhancing convergence speed and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a simple
algorithm ensuring diverse client selection through a selection history queue.
Experiments with a VGG16 model across varied data partitions demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 扩展GS算法在双边不确定性匹配市场中表现优越，可接受间隙和超稳定匹配在稳定匹配复杂度中起关键作用。

Abstract: We study bandit learning in matching markets with two-sided reward
uncertainty, extending prior research primarily focused on single-sided
uncertainty. Leveraging the concept of `super-stability' from Irving (1994), we
demonstrate the advantage of the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm over the
standard GS algorithm in achieving true stable matchings under incomplete
information. By employing the Extended GS algorithm, our centralized algorithm
attains a logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an instance-dependent
admissible gap parameter. This algorithm is further adapted to a decentralized
setting with a constant regret increase. Finally, we establish a novel
centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret,
elucidating the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching in
characterizing the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.

Conclusion: CORAL通过对比潜在对齐有效解决了长尾数据分布下扩散模型的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in generating
high-quality and diverse synthetic data. However, their success typically
assumes a class-balanced training distribution. In real-world settings,
multi-class data often follow a long-tailed distribution, where standard
diffusion models struggle -- producing low-diversity and lower-quality samples
for tail classes. While this degradation is well-documented, its underlying
cause remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the behavior of
diffusion models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify a key issue: the
latent representations (from the bottleneck layer of the U-Net) for tail class
subspaces exhibit significant overlap with those of head classes, leading to
feature borrowing and poor generation quality. Importantly, we show that this
is not merely due to limited data per class, but that the relative class
imbalance significantly contributes to this phenomenon. To address this, we
propose COntrastive Regularization for Aligning Latents (CORAL), a contrastive
latent alignment framework that leverages supervised contrastive losses to
encourage well-separated latent class representations. Experiments demonstrate
that CORAL significantly improves both the diversity and visual quality of
samples generated for tail classes relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Stochastic linear bandits are a fundamental model for sequential decision
making, where an agent selects a vector-valued action and receives a noisy
reward with expected value given by an unknown linear function. Although well
studied in the single-agent setting, many real-world scenarios involve multiple
agents solving heterogeneous bandit problems, each with a different unknown
parameter. Applying single agent algorithms independently ignores cross-agent
similarity and learning opportunities. This paper investigates the optimal
regret achievable in collaborative personalized linear bandits. We provide an
information-theoretic lower bound that characterizes how the number of agents,
the interaction rounds, and the degree of heterogeneity jointly affect regret.
We then propose a new two-stage collaborative algorithm that achieves the
optimal regret. Our analysis models heterogeneity via a hierarchical Bayesian
framework and introduces a novel information-theoretic technique for bounding
regret. Our results offer a complete characterization of when and how
collaboration helps with a optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{mn})$,
$\tilde{O}(dm^{1-\gamma}\sqrt{n})$, $\tilde{O}(dm\sqrt{n})$ for the number of
rounds $n$ in the range of $(0, \frac{d}{m \sigma^2})$, $[\frac{d}{m^{2\gamma}
\sigma^2}, \frac{d}{\sigma^2}]$ and $(\frac{d}{\sigma^2}, \infty)$
respectively, where $\sigma$ measures the level of heterogeneity, $m$ is the
number of agents, and $\gamma\in[0, 1/2]$ is an absolute constant. In contrast,
agents without collaboration achieve a regret bound $O(dm\sqrt{n})$ at best.

Abstract: Critical Learning Periods comprehend an important phenomenon involving deep
learning, where early epochs play a decisive role in the success of many
training recipes, such as data augmentation. Existing works confirm the
existence of this phenomenon and provide useful insights. However, the
literature lacks efforts to precisely identify when critical periods occur. In
this work, we fill this gap by introducing a systematic approach for
identifying critical periods during the training of deep neural networks,
focusing on eliminating computationally intensive regularization techniques and
effectively applying mechanisms for reducing computational costs, such as data
pruning. Our method leverages generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint
critical phases where training recipes yield maximum benefits to the predictive
ability of models. By halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods,
we significantly accelerate the learning phase and achieve reductions in
training time, energy consumption, and CO$_2$ emissions. Experiments on
standard architectures and benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method.
Specifically, we achieve significant milestones by reducing the training time
of popular architectures by up to 59.67%, leading to a 59.47% decrease in
CO$_2$ emissions and a 60% reduction in financial costs, without compromising
performance. Our work enhances understanding of training dynamics and paves the
way for more sustainable and efficient deep learning practices, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. In the era of the race for foundation
models, we believe our method emerges as a valuable framework. The repository

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting
features learned by large language models (LLMs). It aims to recover complex
superposed polysemantic features into interpretable monosemantic ones through
feature reconstruction via sparsely activated neural networks. Despite the wide
applications of SAEs, it remains unclear under what conditions an SAE can fully
recover the ground truth monosemantic features from the superposed polysemantic
ones. In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we for the first time
propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs (SAEs
that learn unique and ground truth monosemantic features), including 1) extreme
sparsity of the ground truth feature, 2) sparse activation of SAEs, and 3)
enough hidden dimensions of SAEs. Moreover, when the identifiable conditions
are not fully met, we propose a reweighting strategy to improve the
identifiability. Specifically, following the theoretically suggested weight
selection principle, we prove that the gap between the loss functions of SAE
reconstruction and monosemantic feature reconstruction can be narrowed, so that
the reweighted SAEs have better reconstruction of the ground truth monosemantic
features than the uniformly weighted ones. In experiments, we validate our
theoretical findings and show that our weighted SAE significantly improves
feature monosemanticity and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法在长推理任务中表现不佳，未能捕捉Token Importance Recurrence现象。

Method: 提出LazyEviction框架，包含Recurrence Interval Tracking和Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric Eviction Policy。

Result: 实验显示LazyEviction将KV缓存减少50%，同时保持数学推理数据集的准确性。

Conclusion: 保留周期性关键token对多步推理任务的知识连续性至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by
employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences
introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache
size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as
mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate
memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance
Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention
after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and
may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To
address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed
to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an
Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring
tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two
key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal
variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric
Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by
50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance
of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge
continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: AutoHFormer是一种层次自回归Transformer，通过分层时间建模、动态窗口注意力和自适应时间编码解决了时间序列预测的三个关键挑战，实现了高效且精确的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测需要同时满足严格的时间因果性、次二次复杂度和多尺度模式识别，现有方法难以兼顾这些目标。

Method: 1) 分层时间建模：并行处理段级块，再顺序细化；2) 动态窗口注意力：使用可学习因果窗口；3) 自适应时间编码：结合固定振荡模式和可学习衰减率。

Result: AutoHFormer在PEMS08上训练速度提升10.76倍，内存减少6.06倍，同时在96-720步预测范围内保持高精度。

Conclusion: AutoHFormer为高效且精确的时间序列建模设定了新基准。

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve
three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable
predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3)
multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We
introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal
Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks
processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This
dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient
computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs
learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while
preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the
anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks
of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system
is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed
oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for
long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X
faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08,
while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of
cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise
time series modeling. Implementations of our method and all baselines in
hierarchical autoregressive mechanism are available at

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), powered by self-supervised learning (SSL), have
redefined the capabilities of artificial intelligence, demonstrating
exceptional performance in domains like natural language processing and
computer vision. These advances present a transformative opportunity for brain
signal analysis. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which is limited by
the scarcity of labeled neural data, SSL offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This
is particularly valuable in addressing the unique challenges of brain signals,
including high noise levels, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise
ratios. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of bridging brain
signals with foundation models through the innovative application of SSL. It
explores key SSL techniques, the development of brain-specific foundation
models, their adaptation to downstream tasks, and the integration of brain
signals with other modalities in multimodal SSL frameworks. The review also
covers commonly used evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets that support
comparative analysis. Finally, it highlights key challenges and outlines future
research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a structured
understanding of this rapidly evolving field and a roadmap for developing
generalizable brain foundation models powered by self-supervision.

Motivation: 解决基于价值的强化学习中可解释性不足的问题，同时提升训练稳定性和收敛性。

Method: VRAIL分为DL阶段（拟合价值函数）和RL阶段（通过奖励转换塑造学习），支持线性和二次模型以解释特征重要性。

Result: 在Taxi-v3环境中，VRAIL比标准DQN表现更优，无需环境修改即可揭示语义子目标（如乘客状态）。

Conclusion: VRAIL是一个通用的、模型无关的奖励塑造框架，显著提升学习和可解释性。

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable
Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL)
that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL
consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value
function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning
via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either
linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual
features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment
demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to
standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis
shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger
possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior.
Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework
for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

Abstract: Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using
approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce
the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order
tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the
order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis
across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum
physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is
to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as
gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and
tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly
nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing
significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach
to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging
the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained
to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient
descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.
Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian
regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges
to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably,
both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially
rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker
and tensor-train format tensors.

Result: 在Temple University EEG和CHB-MIT数据集上，CRIA在事件分类和异常检测任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CRIA通过多视角融合和注意力机制显著提升了EEG表示学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively
integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for
developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation
learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the
contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and
synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the
expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these
issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes
variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation
of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view
information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction
among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a
cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features
effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the
information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training
scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the
CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same
pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for
multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting
its strong generalization ability.

Abstract: The classical universal approximation (UA) theorem for neural networks
establishes mild conditions under which a feedforward neural network can
approximate a continuous function $f$ with arbitrary accuracy. A recent result
shows that neural networks also enjoy a more general interval universal
approximation (IUA) theorem, in the sense that the abstract interpretation
semantics of the network using the interval domain can approximate the direct
image map of $f$ (i.e., the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs) with
arbitrary accuracy. These theorems, however, rest on the unrealistic assumption
that the neural network computes over infinitely precise real numbers, whereas
their software implementations in practice compute over finite-precision
floating-point numbers. An open question is whether the IUA theorem still holds
in the floating-point setting.
  This paper introduces the first IUA theorem for floating-point neural
networks that proves their remarkable ability to perfectly capture the direct
image map of any rounded target function $f$, showing no limits exist on their
expressiveness. Our IUA theorem in the floating-point setting exhibits material
differences from the real-valued setting, which reflects the fundamental
distinctions between these two computational models. This theorem also implies
surprising corollaries, which include (i) the existence of provably robust
floating-point neural networks; and (ii) the computational completeness of the
class of straight-line programs that use only floating-point additions and
multiplications for the class of all floating-point programs that halt.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的深度展开网络（RLDDU-Net），用于解决WMMSE预编码在OFDM系统中的高计算复杂性和不完美CSI问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WMMSE预编码在OFDM系统中的实际应用受到完美CSI假设和高计算复杂性的限制。

Method: 开发了宽频随机WMMSE（SWMMSE）算法，并基于此设计了RL驱动的深度展开网络（RLDDU-Net），利用波束域稀疏性和频域子载波相关性加速收敛。

Result: 仿真结果表明，RLDDU-Net在不完美CSI下优于现有基线，具有更高的EWSR性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: RLDDU-Net为大规模MU-MIMO OFDM系统提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) precoding is widely recognized for
its near-optimal weighted sum rate performance. However, its practical
deployment in massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is hindered by the
assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) and high computational
complexity. To address these issues, we first develop a wideband stochastic
WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm that iteratively maximizes the ergodic weighted
sum-rate (EWSR) under imperfect CSI. Building on this, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning (RL)-driven deep unfolding (DU) network (RLDDU-Net),
where each SWMMSE iteration is mapped to a network layer. Specifically, its DU
module integrates approximation techniques and leverages beam-domain sparsity
as well as frequency-domain subcarrier correlation, significantly accelerating
convergence and reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, the RL module
adaptively adjusts the network depth and generates compensation matrices to
mitigate approximation errors. Simulation results under imperfect CSI
demonstrate that RLDDU-Net outperforms existing baselines in EWSR performance
while offering superior computational and convergence efficiency.

Result: 仿真结果表明，CAAC在能效和QoS满足方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAAC为6G网络提供了一种灵活高效的预编码解决方案。

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are expected to support diverse quality-of-service (QoS)
demands while maintaining high energy efficiency. Weighted Minimum Mean Square
Error (WMMSE) precoding with fixed user priorities and transmit power is widely
recognized for enhancing overall system performance but lacks flexibility to
adapt to user-specific QoS requirements and time-varying channel conditions. To
address this, we propose a novel constrained reinforcement learning (CRL)
algorithm, Constrained-Actor Attentive-Critic (CAAC), which uses a policy
network to dynamically allocate user priorities and power for WMMSE precoding.
Specifically, CAAC integrates a Constrained Stochastic Successive Convex
Approximation (CSSCA) method to optimize the policy, enabling more effective
handling of energy efficiency goals and satisfaction of stochastic non-convex
QoS constraints compared to traditional and existing CRL methods. Moreover,
CAAC employs lightweight attention-enhanced Q-networks to evaluate policy
updates without prior environment model knowledge. The network architecture not
only enhances representational capacity but also boosts learning efficiency.
Simulation results show that CAAC outperforms baselines in both energy
efficiency and QoS satisfaction.

Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial
General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we
observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned
models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment
methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently
altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden
activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To
explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we
introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the
original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local
sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying
vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak
trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More
importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving
alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch
Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations
into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight
that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general
capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment
paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move
beyond surface-level behavior supervision. Codes and results are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段图学习框架B2P-GL，结合脑区语义相似性和基于条件的群体图建模，提升脑疾病诊断性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于图的脑疾病诊断方法依赖预定义脑图谱，但忽略了图谱内丰富信息及站点和表型变异的混杂效应。

Method: 第一阶段（脑表征学习）利用GPT-4知识丰富图谱表示，并通过自适应节点重分配图注意力网络优化脑图；第二阶段（群体疾病诊断）整合表型数据构建群体图并融合特征以减少混杂效应。

Conclusion: B2P-GL为脑疾病诊断提供了可靠且个性化的方法，推动了临床应用。

Abstract: Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using
functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook
the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of
site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates
the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph
modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage
brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine
the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network.
In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is
incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate
confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE
I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing
interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and
personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical
applicability.

Result: 实验表明该方法在分类准确性和拉普拉斯谱保留上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了结构瓶颈减少和图特性保留，具有优越性能。

Abstract: The message-passing paradigm of Graph Neural Networks often struggles with
exchanging information across distant nodes typically due to structural
bottlenecks in certain graph regions, a limitation known as
\textit{over-squashing}. To reduce such bottlenecks, \textit{graph rewiring},
which modifies graph topology, has been widely used. However, existing graph
rewiring techniques often overlook the need to preserve critical properties of
the original graph, e.g., \textit{spectral properties}. Moreover, many
approaches rely on increasing edge count to improve connectivity, which
introduces significant computational overhead and exacerbates the risk of
over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph rewiring method that
leverages \textit{spectrum-preserving} graph \textit{sparsification}, for
mitigating over-squashing. Our method generates graphs with enhanced
connectivity while maintaining sparsity and largely preserving the original
graph spectrum, effectively balancing structural bottleneck reduction and graph
property preservation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach, demonstrating its superiority over strong baseline methods in
classification accuracy and retention of the Laplacian spectrum.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解知识蒸馏如何影响LLM对任务数据的记忆，以解决隐私和安全问题。

Method: 比较不同KD方法在将大型教师模型蒸馏为小型学生模型时对记忆任务数据的影响。

Result: 蒸馏不仅降低计算成本和模型大小，还显著减少记忆风险。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是减少LLM记忆风险的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize parts of their training
data, raising important concerns around privacy and security. While previous
research has focused on studying memorization in pre-trained models, much less
is known about how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization.In this
study, we explore how different KD methods influence the memorization of
fine-tuned task data when a large teacher model is distilled into smaller
student variants.This study demonstrates that distilling a larger teacher
model, fine-tuned on a dataset, into a smaller variant not only lowers
computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces the
memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

Result: 通过错误函数测量AI的幻觉和误听水平。

Conclusion: 实验为AI在复杂语言和艺术表达中的应用提供了有趣但非正式的评估。

Abstract: All languages are peculiar. Some of them are considered more challenging to
understand than others. The Finnish Language is known to be a complex language.
Also, when languages are used by artists, the pronunciation and meaning might
be more tricky to understand. Therefore, we are putting AI to a fun, yet
challenging trial: translating a Finnish rap song to text. We will compare the
Faster Whisperer algorithm and YouTube's internal speech-to-text functionality.
The reference truth will be Finnish rap lyrics, which the main author's little
brother, Mc Timo, has written. Transcribing the lyrics will be challenging
because the artist raps over synth music player by Syntikka Janne. The
hallucination level and mishearing of AI speech-to-text extractions will be
measured by comparing errors made against the original Finnish lyrics. The
error function is informal but still works for our case.

Method: POST通过知识蒸馏、本地调优和差分隐私，实现软提示的私有化转移。

Result: POST降低了计算成本，保护了隐私，并成功转移高效软提示。

Conclusion: POST为软提示的私有化和高效转移提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Prompting has become a dominant paradigm for adapting large language models
(LLMs). While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their
interpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in
APIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples
while minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context
window for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to
the LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This
constraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning
prompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs
continue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,
soft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.
For instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these
issues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that
enables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently
transfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to
derive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt
transferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential
privacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small
public dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs,
preserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to optimize the radio resource management of a
communication system between a remote controller and its device, whose state is
represented through image frames, without compromising the performance of the
control task. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) technique to jointly
model and predict the dynamics of the control system as well as the wireless
propagation environment in latent space. Our method leverages two coupled
joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs): a control JEPA models the
control dynamics and guides the predictions of a wireless JEPA, which captures
the dynamics of the device's channel state information (CSI) through
cross-modal conditioning. We then train a deep reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm to derive a control policy from latent control dynamics and a power
predictor to estimate scheduling intervals with favorable channel conditions
based on latent CSI representations. As such, the controller minimizes the
usage of radio resources by utilizing the coupled JEPA networks to imagine the
device's trajectory in latent space. We present simulation results on synthetic
multimodal data and show that our proposed approach reduces transmit power by
over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to baseline methods
that do not account for wireless optimization.

Result: BLANCE在结构准确性和贝叶斯参数估计方面优于现有方法，对LM噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BLANCE通过结合LM知识和局部观测数据，为因果发现提供了一种鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data typically assumes full access to
data and availability of domain experts. In practice, data often arrive in
batches, and expert knowledge is scarce. Language Models (LMs) offer a
surrogate but come with their own issues-hallucinations, inconsistencies, and
bias. We present BLANCE (Bayesian LM-Augmented Causal Estimation)-a hybrid
Bayesian framework that bridges these gaps by adaptively integrating sequential
batch data with LM-derived noisy, expert knowledge while accounting for both
data-induced and LM-induced biases. Our proposed representation shift from
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) accommodates
ambiguities within a coherent Bayesian framework, allowing grounding the global
LM knowledge in local observational data. To guide LM interaction, we use a
sequential optimization scheme that adaptively queries the most informative
edges. Across varied datasets, BLANCE outperforms prior work in structural
accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM
noise.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅优化了图像重建，还能适应多种图像分析任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: A key challenge in maximizing the benefits of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) in clinical settings is to accelerate acquisition times without
significantly degrading image quality. This objective requires a balance
between under-sampling the raw k-space measurements for faster acquisitions and
gathering sufficient raw information for high-fidelity image reconstruction and
analysis tasks. To achieve this balance, we propose to use sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED) to provide an adaptive and task-dependent selection
of the most informative measurements. Measurements are sequentially augmented
with new samples selected to maximize information gain on a posterior
distribution over target images. Selection is performed via a gradient-based
optimization of a design parameter that defines a subsampling pattern. In this
work, we introduce a new active BED procedure that leverages diffusion-based
generative models to handle the high dimensionality of the images and employs
stochastic optimization to select among a variety of patterns while meeting the
acquisition process constraints and budget. So doing, we show how our setting
can optimize, not only standard image reconstruction, but also any associated
image analysis task. The versatility and performance of our approach are
demonstrated on several MRI acquisitions.

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, and
high-quality EEG data from ALS patients are scarce. This data scarcity, coupled
with severe class imbalance between ALS and healthy control recordings, poses a
challenge for training reliable machine learning classifiers. In this work, we
address these issues by generating synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients using
a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN). We train
CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of
ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and
normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS
signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key
hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated
signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training
converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating
successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have
potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate
class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy. We discuss how this
approach can facilitate data sharing and enhance diagnostic models.

Conclusion: 蒙特卡洛预测方法在高模糊性预测中具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究以解决剩余挑战。

Abstract: The rapid adaptation ability of auto-regressive foundation models is often
attributed to the diversity of their pre-training data. This is because, from a
Bayesian standpoint, minimizing prediction error in such settings requires
integrating over all plausible latent hypotheses consistent with observations.
While this behavior is desirable in principle, it often proves too ambitious in
practice: under high ambiguity, the number of plausible latent alternatives
makes Bayes-optimal prediction computationally intractable. Cognitive science
has long recognized this limitation, suggesting that under such conditions,
heuristics or information-seeking strategies are preferable to exhaustive
inference. Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize
that low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands,
making ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias.
To test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning
benchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle. We
show that Transformers indeed struggle with high-ambiguity predictions across
model sizes. Motivated by cognitive theories, we propose a method to convert
pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors that decouple task inference
from token prediction. Preliminary results show substantial gains in ambiguous
contexts through improved capacity allocation and test-time scalable inference,
though challenges remain.

Conclusion: ENN-GFN-Enhanced通过不确定性驱动探索，显著提升了轨迹识别的效率与效果。

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open
problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize
exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not
been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in
other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute
can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for
combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate
epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets
to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty
quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal
trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the
baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured
sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and
efficiency.

Conclusion: Beta核为有界域的函数优化提供了更有效的工具，扩展了高斯过程的应用范围。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes (GP) is commonly used to
optimize black-box functions. The Mat\'ern and the Radial Basis Function (RBF)
covariance functions are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions
about the domain of the function, which may limit their applicability in
bounded domains. To address the limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a
non-stationary kernel induced by a product of Beta distribution density
functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to naturally model functions on
bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis that
the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on empirical analyses
of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with optima
located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments show
that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including the
well-known Mat\'ern and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic
function optimization and the compression of vision and language models.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising
approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in
autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior
work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work,
we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking
techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse
cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens
significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To
address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations,
neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom
tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a
complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate,
our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically
grounded p-values.

Abstract: Increasing global energy demand and renewable integration complexity have
placed buildings at the center of sustainable energy management. We present a
three-step reinforcement learning(RL)-based Building Energy Management System
(BEMS) that combines clustering, forecasting, and constrained policy learning
to address scalability, adaptability, and safety challenges. First, we cluster
non-shiftable load profiles to identify common consumption patterns, enabling
policy generalization and transfer without retraining for each new building.
Next, we integrate an LSTM based forecasting module to anticipate future
states, improving the RL agents' responsiveness to dynamic conditions. Lastly,
domain-informed action masking ensures safe exploration and operation,
preventing harmful decisions. Evaluated on real-world data, our approach
reduces operating costs by up to 15% for certain building types, maintains
stable environmental performance, and quickly classifies and optimizes new
buildings with limited data. It also adapts to stochastic tariff changes
without retraining. Overall, this framework delivers scalable, robust, and
cost-effective building energy management.

*Alexey Zakharov,Shimon Whiteson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GoalLadder利用视觉语言模型（VLM）从单一语言指令中训练强化学习（RL）代理，通过逐步发现任务进展状态并减少噪声反馈的影响，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言可以为强化学习任务提供简洁且人类可理解的规范，但从语言指令中提取奖励仍具挑战性，尤其是在视觉环境中。现有方法依赖非视觉环境表示或需要大量反馈，且生成的奖励函数可能噪声较大。

Method: GoalLadder通过查询VLM识别任务进展状态并利用ELO评级系统对潜在目标状态进行排序，减少噪声反馈的影响。代理通过最小化与排名最高目标的距离来学习，无需大量准确反馈。

Result: GoalLadder在经典控制和机器人操作环境中表现优异，平均最终成功率约为95%，而最佳竞争对手仅为45%。

Conclusion: GoalLadder通过结合VLM和ELO评级系统，有效解决了从语言指令中提取奖励的挑战，显著提升了RL代理的性能。

Abstract: Natural language can offer a concise and human-interpretable means of
specifying reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. The ability to extract rewards
from a language instruction can enable the development of robotic systems that
can learn from human guidance; however, it remains a challenging problem,
especially in visual environments. Existing approaches that employ large,
pretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment
representations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate
noisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
$\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL
agents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder
works by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to
completing a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to
identify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to
rank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not
trust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal
states using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects
of noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with
minimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,
which is trained on unlabelled visual data. This key feature allows us to
bypass the need for abundant and accurate feedback typically required to train
a well-shaped reward function. We demonstrate that GoalLadder outperforms
existing related methods on classic control and robotic manipulation
environments with the average final success rate of $\sim$95% compared to only
$\sim$45% of the best competitor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有向图在多个领域有广泛应用，但其生成方法研究不足，主要受限于依赖空间大和缺乏标准化基准。

Method: 结合了针对非对称关系的编码、双注意力机制和离散生成框架。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，甚至在某些类别（如有向无环图）上与专用模型竞争。

Conclusion: Directo为有向图生成研究奠定了坚实基础，展示了方法的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered
relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social
networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such
as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however,
directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors
limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality
introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying
distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks
hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive
models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the
first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow
matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings
tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism
capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete
generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite
covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs
strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for
particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the
effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation
for future research in directed graph generation.

Conclusion: 提示条件参数生成是梯度微调的有效替代方案，能够快速定制LLMs。

Abstract: Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs),
yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We
introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned
parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of
unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text
encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then
transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA
matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD
produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to
\textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains
up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen
common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii)
robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or
labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is
a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing
LLMs. Our project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构的可扩展性依赖于路由器模块，但不良路由会导致负载不平衡和准确性下降，因此需要优化路由器设计。

Method: 设计了六种路由器变体（Linear、Attention、MLP、Hybrid、Hash和MLP-Hadamard），并在BERT和Qwen1.5-MoE模型上进行了实验评估。

Result: 不同路由器在速度、表达能力和稀疏路由方面表现出不同的权衡，MLP-Hadamard路由器在结构化稀疏路由中表现独特。

Conclusion: 研究为MoE路由器设计提供了比较分析，并为大规模模型部署的优化提供了见解。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures increase large language model
scalability, yet their performance depends on the router module that moves
tokens to specialized experts. Bad routing can load imbalance and reduced
accuracy. This project designed and implemented different router architectures
within Transformer models to fix these limitations. We experimented with six
distinct router variants Linear, Attention, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Hybrid, Hash, and our new MLP-Hadamard. We characterized these routers using
BERT and the Qwen1.5-MoE model, looking at parameter efficiency, inference
latency, routing entropy, and expert utilization patterns. Our evaluations
showed distinct trade-offs: Linear routers offer speed, while MLP and Attention
routers provide greater expressiveness. The MLP-Hadamard router shows a unique
capability for structured, sparse routing. We successfully replaced and
fine-tuned custom routers within the complex, quantized Qwen1.5-MoE model. This
work provides a comparative analysis of MoE router designs and offers insights
into optimizing their performance for efficient and effective large-scale model
deployment.

TL;DR: EFormer是一种基于边的Transformer模型，用于解决车辆路径问题（VRP），通过并行编码和解码策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经启发式方法依赖节点坐标，而实际场景中基于边的距离更相关，因此需要更有效的输入方式。

Method: EFormer使用边作为唯一输入，通过预编码模块和并行编码策略生成全局关系表示，解码时采用并行上下文嵌入和多查询集成。

Result: 在TSP和CVRP上，EFormer优于基线方法，并在真实数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: EFormer的设计有效解决了VRP问题，验证了其核心方法的优越性。

Abstract: Recent neural heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) primarily rely
on node coordinates as input, which may be less effective in practical
scenarios where real cost metrics-such as edge-based distances-are more
relevant. To address this limitation, we introduce EFormer, an Edge-based
Transformer model that uses edge as the sole input for VRPs. Our approach
employs a precoder module with a mixed-score attention mechanism to convert
edge information into temporary node embeddings. We also present a parallel
encoding strategy characterized by a graph encoder and a node encoder, each
responsible for processing graph and node embeddings in distinct feature
spaces, respectively. This design yields a more comprehensive representation of
the global relationships among edges. In the decoding phase, parallel context
embedding and multi-query integration are used to compute separate attention
mechanisms over the two encoded embeddings, facilitating efficient path
construction. We train EFormer using reinforcement learning in an
autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) reveal that EFormer
outperforms established baselines on synthetic datasets, including large-scale
and diverse distributions. Moreover, EFormer demonstrates strong generalization
on real-world instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. These findings confirm the
effectiveness of EFormer's core design in solving VRPs.

Conclusion: XAI方法在PINN训练中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful approach to solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are ubiquitous in the quantitative
sciences. Applied to both forward and inverse problems across various
scientific domains, PINNs have recently emerged as a valuable tool in the field
of scientific machine learning. A key aspect of their training is that the data
-- spatio-temporal points sampled from the PDE's input domain -- are readily
available. Influence functions, a tool from the field of explainable AI (XAI),
approximate the effect of individual training points on the model, enhancing
interpretability. In the present work, we explore the application of influence
function-based sampling approaches for the training data. Our results indicate
that such targeted resampling based on data attribution methods has the
potential to enhance prediction accuracy in physics-informed neural networks,
demonstrating a practical application of an XAI method in PINN training.

Abstract: EEG is a non-invasive, safe, and low-risk method to record
electrophysiological signals inside the brain. Especially with recent
technology developments like dry electrodes, consumer-grade EEG devices, and
rapid advances in machine learning, EEG is commonly used as a resource for
automatic emotion recognition. With the aim to develop a deep learning model
that can perform EEG-based emotion recognition in a real-life context, we
propose a novel approach to utilize multi-scale convolutional neural networks
to accomplish such tasks. By implementing feature extraction kernels with many
ratio coefficients as well as a new type of kernel that learns key information
from four separate areas of the brain, our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art TSception model in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance
scores across many performance evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 标准LoRA独立优化低秩矩阵，限制了其表达能力和泛化性能，而传统的TT分解方法未能显著提升性能。

Method: TensorGuide通过统一的TT结构生成两个相关的低秩LoRA矩阵，利用高斯噪声驱动优化。

Result: 实验表明，TensorGuide在量子点分类和GPT-2微调任务中优于标准LoRA和TT-LoRA，参数效率更高。

Conclusion: TensorGuide显著提升了LoRA的表达能力和泛化性能，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely recognized for its parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large-scale neural models. However, standard LoRA independently
optimizes low-rank matrices, which inherently limits its expressivity and
generalization capabilities. While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition
can be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates
that the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter
efficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes
TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these
limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices
through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The
resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank
adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and
parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters.
Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel
analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced
generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2
fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently
outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and
scalability with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: 共享表示在多任务学习中存在信息泄露风险，需设计更安全的机制以保护隐私。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages
similarities among multiple learning tasks, each with insufficient samples to
train a standalone model, to solve them simultaneously while minimizing data
sharing across users and organizations. MTL typically accomplishes this goal by
learning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks
by embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being
designed to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively
learn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can
inadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were
trained on.
  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared
representations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose
a novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the
embedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples
from a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when
training the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box
attacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between
embeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled
reference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for
multiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh
task samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully
infer a task's inclusion in training. To complement our experiments, we provide
theoretical analysis of a simplified learning setting and show a strict
separation between adversaries with training samples and fresh samples from the
target task's distribution.

Conclusion: PITA为扩散采样提供了一种高效的新方法，适用于复杂分子系统的采样。

Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a
core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific
applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of
amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from
state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing
diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at
the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn
diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation
techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion
smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low
temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher
temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the
temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables
simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower
temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using
a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA
enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems,
Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically
lower energy function evaluations. Code available at:

Motivation: ECG信号分析存在个体差异、标签标准不一致等问题，传统方法难以处理。NLDR无需训练或先验信息，能识别临床相关特征。

Method: 使用非线性降维技术（如t-SNE和UMAP）分析MIT-BIH数据集中的MLII和V1导联信号，区分不同心律失常。

Conclusion: NLDR在心脏监测和个性化医疗中具有潜力，适用于单导联和12导联ECG。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart
activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring
cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and
prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for
automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations
in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals
can vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow
different labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder
supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component
analysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and
typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are
missing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail.
Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate
these issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no
need for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the
MIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate
individual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish
different arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96%
and a median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise
for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the
current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond
cardiology.

Conclusion: SparseLoRA在减少计算成本的同时，不影响模型性能，为LLM微调提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the
number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease
computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this
paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, a method that accelerates LLM fine-tuning
through contextual sparsity. We propose a lightweight, training-free SVD
sparsity estimator that dynamically selects a sparse subset of weights for loss
and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address
sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results
show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 times and a
measured speedup of up to 1.6 times while maintaining accuracy across various
downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code
generation, and instruction following.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了秩崩溃问题，还为模型合并提供了新的可解释视角。

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models
into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits
of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to
diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we
offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing
that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods)
continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space
experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace
Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and
maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up
to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new
interpretable perspective on model merging.

TL;DR: Crome框架通过因果增强和中性增强解决奖励模型中的奖励黑客问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型（RMs）常因奖励黑客问题而失效，即模型错误地将表面特征（如回答长度）与质量关联。

Method: Crome通过因果增强（针对因果属性）和中性增强（针对虚假属性）训练奖励模型，无需虚假因素知识。

Result: Crome在RewardBench上平均准确率提升5.4%，特定类别提升达13.2%和7.2%。

Conclusion: Crome显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和性能，适用于多种任务和基准。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to
latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or
formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for
the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs
because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors,
leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally
Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model
designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic
targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are
pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity
along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which
are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce
invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced
without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along
causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically,
Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving
average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in
specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the

*Bornali Phukon,Xiuwen Zheng,Mark Hasegawa-Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新指标，结合NLI分数、语义相似性和语音相似性，用于评估ASR系统在发音障碍语音中的可懂度，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR指标（如WER和CER）无法准确反映发音障碍语音的可懂度，而ASR系统在处理此类语音时表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种新指标，整合NLI分数、语义相似性和语音相似性。

Result: 新指标在Speech Accessibility Project数据上与人类判断的相关性达到0.890，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 强调应优先考虑可懂度而非基于错误的指标，新指标在发音障碍语音评估中表现优异。

Abstract: Traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER fail to capture intelligibility,
especially for dysarthric and dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment
matters more than exact word matches. ASR systems struggle with these speech
types, often producing errors like phoneme repetitions and imprecise
consonants, yet the meaning remains clear to human listeners. We identify two
key challenges: (1) Existing metrics do not adequately reflect intelligibility,
and (2) while LLMs can refine ASR output, their effectiveness in correcting ASR
transcripts of dysarthric speech remains underexplored. To address this, we
propose a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores,
semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity. Our ASR evaluation metric
achieves a 0.890 correlation with human judgments on Speech Accessibility
Project data, surpassing traditional methods and emphasizing the need to
prioritize intelligibility over error-based measures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为自适应表示误导遗忘（RMU）的技术，用于从大语言模型（LLMs）中删除敏感信息，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但其对训练数据的记忆可能引发隐私、版权和安全问题，尤其是涉及个人身份信息（PII）时。

Method: 采用自适应表示误导遗忘（RMU）技术，通过分析不同解码层的影响，确定最有效的敏感信息删除区域。

Result: 该技术在1B和7B参数模型的官方排行榜上均排名第四。

Conclusion: RMU技术为LLMs中的敏感信息遗忘提供了一种有效解决方案，但仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation. However, their tendency to
memorize training data raises concerns regarding privacy, copyright compliance,
and security, particularly in cases involving Personally Identifiable
Information (PII). Effective machine unlearning techniques are essential to
mitigate these risks, yet existing methods remain underdeveloped for LLMs due
to their open-ended output space. In this work, we apply the Adaptive
Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) technique to unlearn sensitive
information from LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the effects of
unlearning across different decoder layers to determine the most effective
regions for sensitive information removal. Our technique ranked 4th on the
official leaderboard of both 1B parameter and 7B parameter models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过将Transformer模型中的token嵌入和注意力机制表示为自伴算子，重新解释注意力机制为非交换卷积，从而更深入地理解模型的信息流和结构复杂性。

Method: 使用自由概率理论中的工具，将注意力机制和token嵌入建模为自伴算子，并通过自由加性卷积分析层间表示的传播。

Result: 提出了基于自由熵的泛化边界，并证明Transformer层的谱迹随深度可预测地演化。

Conclusion: 该框架将神经架构与非交换调和分析联系起来，为大型语言模型的信息流和结构复杂性提供了理论分析工具。

Abstract: We outline an operator-theoretic framework for analyzing transformer-based
language models using the tools of free probability theory. By representing
token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a racial
probability space, we reinterpret attention as a non-commutative convolution
and view the layer-wise propagation of representations as an evolution governed
by free additive convolution. This formalism reveals a spectral dynamical
system underpinning deep transformer stacks and offers insight into their
inductive biases, generalization behavior, and entropy dynamics. We derive a
generalization bound based on free entropy and demonstrate that the spectral
trace of transformer layers evolves predictably with depth. Our approach
bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, enabling
principled analysis of information flow and structural complexity in large
language models

*Soroush H. Zargarbashi,Mohammad Sadegh Akhondzadeh,Aleksandar Bojchevski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种单样本鲁棒共形预测方法（RCP1），通过单次随机扰动输入实现鲁棒性，减少了计算开销，同时保持了较小的预测集大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于平滑的鲁棒共形预测（RCP）需要多次模型前向传播，计算成本高。本文旨在通过单次扰动输入实现鲁棒性，降低计算负担。

Method: 利用任何二元证书，提出单样本鲁棒共形预测（RCP1），通过认证共形预测过程而非单个分数来实现鲁棒性。

Result: RCP1在保持较小平均集大小的同时，显著减少了计算开销（如从100次前向传播减少到1次）。

Conclusion: RCP1是一种高效且通用的鲁棒共形预测方法，适用于分类和回归任务，并可扩展到鲁棒共形风险控制。

Abstract: Given any model, conformal prediction (CP) returns prediction sets guaranteed
to include the true label with high adjustable probability. Robust CP (RCP)
extends this to inputs with worst-case noise. A well-established approach is to
use randomized smoothing for RCP since it is applicable to any black-box model
and provides smaller sets compared to deterministic methods. However, current
smoothing-based RCP requires many model forward passes per each input which is
computationally expensive. We show that conformal prediction attains some
robustness even with a forward pass on a single randomly perturbed input. Using
any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1). Our
approach returns robust sets with smaller average set size compared to SOTA
methods which use many (e.g. around 100) passes per input. Our key insight is
to certify the conformal prediction procedure itself rather than individual
scores. Our approach is agnostic to the setup (classification and regression).
We further extend our approach to smoothing-based robust conformal risk
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法在多任务或持续学习中样本效率低，迁移知识可能因任务差异导致次优指导。

Result: 理论证明能量分数反映教师的状态访问密度，实验显示在单任务和多任务中均提高了样本效率和性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了迁移学习中次优指导的问题，提升了强化学习的适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from poor sample efficiency,
making them challenging to apply in multi-task or continual learning settings.
Efficiency can be improved by transferring knowledge from a previously trained
teacher policy to guide exploration in new but related tasks. However, if the
new task sufficiently differs from the teacher's training task, the transferred
guidance may be sub-optimal and bias exploration toward low-reward behaviors.
We propose an energy-based transfer learning method that uses
out-of-distribution detection to selectively issue guidance, enabling the
teacher to intervene only in states within its training distribution. We
theoretically show that energy scores reflect the teacher's state-visitation
density and empirically demonstrate improved sample efficiency and performance
across both single-task and multi-task settings.

TL;DR: FLAME是一种基于稀疏混合专家架构的新型联邦学习框架，通过动态激活专家数量实现客户端适应性，解决了现有方法因压缩导致性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的联邦学习方法因压缩全局矩阵导致信息丢失和性能下降，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: FLAME采用稀疏混合专家架构，保留完整全局LoRA矩阵，通过动态激活专家数量和轻量级重缩放机制解决输出幅度不匹配问题。

Result: 实验表明，FLAME在不同计算环境下均优于现有方法，提供了稳健的资源自适应联邦学习方案。

Conclusion: FLAME通过创新架构和机制，有效解决了联邦学习中的资源适应性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Existing resource-adaptive LoRA federated fine-tuning methods enable clients
to fine-tune models using compressed versions of global LoRA matrices, in order
to accommodate various compute resources across clients. This compression
requirement will lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss. To
address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on
the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches,
FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side
adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client. However,
incorporating SMoE into federated learning introduces unique challenges,
specifically, the mismatch in output magnitude from partial expert activation
and the imbalance in expert training quality across clients. FLAME tackles
these challenges through a lightweight rescaling mechanism and an
activation-aware aggregation scheme. Empirical results across diverse
computational settings demonstrate that FLAME consistently outperforms existing
methods, providing a robust and effective solution for resource-adaptive
federated learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络和图信号处理方法在表示图信号模式时效率不足，尤其是在神经科学等领域中高维、时空模式的信号解码。

Method: 提出SlepNet，使用Slepian基自动学习相关子图，并通过掩码集中信号能量，生成规范且高分辨率的表示。

Result: 在三个fMRI数据集和两个交通动态数据集中，SlepNet均优于基线方法，并能更清晰地区分相似模式。

Conclusion: SlepNet不仅适用于预测任务，还能用于表示学习，为时空数据的下游任务提供有用信息。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on
graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of
graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing
patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in
subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience.
Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult
to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph
Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or
spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown
promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly
confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that
uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian
harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant
subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce
canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing
energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated
SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and
two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional
GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines
in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns
from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns,
and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here
we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for
other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both
for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的强化学习框架，将分布参数作为动作，重新定义了智能体与环境的边界，并开发了低方差的策略梯度估计器DPPG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中动作空间的离散性或混合性限制了算法的通用性，通过将动作重新参数化为分布参数，可以统一处理不同类型的动作空间。

Method: 提出了DPPG策略梯度估计器和ICL插值评论家学习策略，基于TD3开发了DPAC算法。

Result: DPAC在MuJoCo连续控制任务中优于TD3，并在离散化动作空间中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过重新参数化动作空间，DPPG和DPAC算法在连续和离散任务中均表现出色，展示了框架的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats
distribution parameters as actions, redefining the boundary between agent and
environment. This reparameterization makes the new action space continuous,
regardless of the original action type (discrete, continuous, mixed, etc.).
Under this new parameterization, we develop a generalized deterministic policy
gradient estimator, Distribution Parameter Policy Gradient (DPPG), which has
lower variance than the gradient in the original action space. Although
learning the critic over distribution parameters poses new challenges, we
introduce interpolated critic learning (ICL), a simple yet effective strategy
to enhance learning, supported by insights from bandit settings. Building on
TD3, a strong baseline for continuous control, we propose a practical
DPPG-based actor-critic algorithm, Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic (DPAC).
Empirically, DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo continuous control tasks from
OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, and demonstrates competitive performance
on the same environments with discretized action spaces.

TL;DR: DEBIAS算法通过优化结果定义以最大化因果可识别性，解决了精神病学纵向数据中因果推断的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神病学中症状异质性和潜在混杂因素常削弱传统估计方法，现有方法假设固定结果变量且依赖观察到的协变量调整，但实践中无混杂假设可能不成立。

Method: DEBIAS算法学习非负、临床可解释的权重以聚合结果，最大化持久治疗效果，并利用精神病学纵向数据中先前治疗的时滞直接效应最小化观察和潜在混杂。

Result: DEBIAS在抑郁和精神分裂症的综合实验中，始终优于现有方法，恢复临床可解释复合结果的因果效应。

Conclusion: DEBIAS通过优化结果定义和最小化混杂，显著提升了精神病学纵向数据中的因果推断能力。

Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge,
especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding
frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment
effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding
through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of
unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this
foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to
maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with
Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative,
clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable
treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent
confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments
in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically
verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically
interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression
and schizophrenia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如HTML模板提取或关键词过滤）在多语言和上下文敏感场景中表现不佳，而大型语言模型（LLM）成本过高。

Method: SORE通过元数据嵌入识别核心内容，并用近似最近邻搜索标记异常文本段。

Result: 实验显示SORE在HTML数据集上优于结构方法，且在多语言场景中保持高精度。

Conclusion: SORE以低成本实现接近LLM的精度，已投入生产，支持多语言处理，并开源了实现和数据集。

Abstract: Modern text processing pipelines demand robust methods to remove extraneous
content while preserving a document's core message. Traditional approaches such
as HTML boilerplate extraction or keyword filters often fail in multilingual
settings and struggle with context-sensitive nuances, whereas Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer improved quality at high computational cost. We introduce
SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal), a cost-effective, transparent method that
leverages multilingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbor
search to identify and excise unwanted text segments. By first identifying core
content via metadata embedding and then flagging segments that either closely
match predefined outlier groups or deviate significantly from the core, SORE
achieves near-LLM extraction precision at a fraction of the cost. Experiments
on HTML datasets demonstrate that SORE outperforms structural methods and yield
high precision in diverse scenarios. Our system is currently deployed in
production, processing millions of documents daily across multiple languages
while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility
and further research, we release our implementation and evaluation datasets.

Result: 新方法在标准PAC模型中有效，适用于所有基础分布族，具有更好的样本复杂性和噪声容忍性。

Conclusion: 新方法简化了现有技术，提供了更高效、更通用的分布提升解决方案。

Abstract: The apparent difficulty of efficient distribution-free PAC learning has led
to a large body of work on distribution-specific learning. Distributional
assumptions facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their
reach and relevance. Towards addressing this, we prove a distributional-lifting
theorem: This upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited
distribution family $\mathcal{D}$ to one that succeeds with respect to any
distribution $D^\star$, with an efficiency overhead that scales with the
complexity of expressing $D^\star$ as a mixture of distributions in
$\mathcal{D}$.
  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan considered the special case of
lifting uniform-distribution learners and designed a lifter that uses a
conditional sample oracle for $D^\star$, a strong form of access not afforded
by the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws on ideas from
semi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\star$ and then uses this information
to lift.
  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable with
access only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their
use of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that
sidesteps the need to learn $D^\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the
standard PAC model and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base
distribution families, preserves the noise tolerance of learners, has better
sample complexity, and is simpler.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities
of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to
molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among
other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be
constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) -
a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without
traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data,
relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by
primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii)
the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a
database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in
nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first
introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity
graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to
develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges
including large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling
temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational
neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for
relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these
distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple
sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models
that can transform the processing of relational data.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of
generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention
due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering
applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and
discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier
Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and
rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the
Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and
cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and
discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.
This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse
applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO
provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general
advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of
standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional
generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM预训练中优化器状态的最小需求，以降低内存消耗。

Method: 采用列归一化梯度和最后一层动量技术，提出SCALE优化器。

Result: SCALE在多个LLaMA模型中性能优于Adam，内存占用仅为35-45%，且超越其他高效优化器。

Conclusion: SCALE是内存受限大规模预训练的理想选择，并为优化器设计提供了简约基线。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers
such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and
second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as
GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce
memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount
of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art
performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate
this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and
compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)
column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of
plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only
to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance
competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,
we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new
optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where
column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output
dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the
performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also
consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and
APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory
constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art
method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition,
our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer
design.

Result: 在标准基准数据集上达到SOTA分类准确率，并能生成逼真的合成图像。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强、可扩展性好，适用于不同任务，且隐私保护效果显著。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often use large, high-quality datasets to achieve high
performance on many machine learning tasks. When training involves potentially
sensitive data, this process can raise privacy concerns, as large models have
been shown to unintentionally memorize and reveal sensitive information,
including reconstructing entire training samples. Differential privacy (DP)
provides a robust framework for protecting individual data and in particular, a
new approach to privately training deep neural networks is to approximate the
input dataset with a privately generated synthetic dataset, before any
subsequent training algorithm. We introduce a novel principled method for DP
synthetic image embedding generation, based on fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) in an appropriate embedding space using DP clustering. Our method
provably learns a GMM under separation conditions. Empirically, a simple
two-layer neural network trained on synthetically generated embeddings achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy on standard benchmark datasets.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can generate realistic synthetic
images that achieve downstream classification accuracy comparable to SOTA
methods. Our method is quite general, as the encoder and decoder modules can be
freely substituted to suit different tasks. It is also highly scalable,
consisting only of subroutines that scale linearly with the number of samples
and/or can be implemented efficiently in distributed systems.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these
methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence,
particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several
optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules,
auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain
in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss
weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can
be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity
of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this
work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function
and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online
estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our
method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline
RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our
method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training
steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于向量量化（VQ）的新方法，通过生成紧凑的语义ID（SID）替代传统嵌入，解决了工业广告推荐系统中存储和推理成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业广告推荐系统通常需要处理大规模的用户历史数据，传统嵌入方法在实时预测中面临存储和推理成本高的挑战。

Method: 提出了三种创新：多任务VQ-VAE框架（VQ融合）、参数自由的SID-to-embedding转换技术（SIDE）和离散PCA（DPCA）量化方法。

Result: 在大规模工业广告推荐系统中，该方法实现了2.4倍的归一化熵增益提升和3倍的数据占用减少。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了推荐系统的效率和性能，为大规模实时推荐提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Sequence-based recommendations models are driving the state-of-the-art for
industrial ad-recommendation systems. Such systems typically deal with user
histories or sequence lengths ranging in the order of O(10^3) to O(10^4)
events. While adding embeddings at this scale is manageable in pre-trained
models, incorporating them into real-time prediction models is challenging due
to both storage and inference costs. To address this scaling challenge, we
propose a novel approach that leverages vector quantization (VQ) to inject a
compact Semantic ID (SID) as input to the recommendation models instead of a
collection of embeddings. Our method builds on recent works of SIDs by
introducing three key innovations: (i) a multi-task VQ-VAE framework, called VQ
fusion that fuses multiple content embeddings and categorical predictions into
a single Semantic ID; (ii) a parameter-free, highly granular SID-to-embedding
conversion technique, called SIDE, that is validated with two content embedding
collections, thereby eliminating the need for a large parameterized lookup
table; and (iii) a novel quantization method called Discrete-PCA (DPCA) which
generalizes and enhances residual quantization techniques. The proposed
enhancements when applied to a large-scale industrial ads-recommendation system
achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy (NE) gain and 3X reduction in
data footprint compared to traditional SID methods.

Motivation: 探索在给定领域族中，需要从多少随机采样的领域收集数据才能学习到一个在所有领域（包括未见领域）表现良好的模型。

Method: 在PAC框架下建模问题，引入领域破碎维度作为新的组合度量。

Result: 领域破碎维度刻画了领域样本复杂度，并与经典VC维度建立了紧密的定量关系。

Conclusion: 证明在标准PAC设置下可学习的假设类，在该设置下也可学习。

Abstract: We study a fundamental question of domain generalization: given a family of
domains (i.e., data distributions), how many randomly sampled domains do we
need to collect data from in order to learn a model that performs reasonably
well on every seen and unseen domain in the family? We model this problem in
the PAC framework and introduce a new combinatorial measure, which we call the
domain shattering dimension. We show that this dimension characterizes the
domain sample complexity. Furthermore, we establish a tight quantitative
relationship between the domain shattering dimension and the classic VC
dimension, demonstrating that every hypothesis class that is learnable in the
standard PAC setting is also learnable in our setting.

TL;DR: TriCon-SF是一种新型串行联邦学习框架，通过三重随机化和贡献感知提升隐私和鲁棒性，优于标准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决串行管道训练中的隐私泄露、梯度泄漏和恶意客户端问题，特别是在医疗等隐私敏感领域。

Method: 结合三重随机化（模型层、数据段、训练顺序）和Shapley值方法动态评估客户端贡献。

Result: 在非独立同分布医疗数据集上表现优于标准方法，提升准确性和通信效率。

Conclusion: TriCon-SF在隐私保护和鲁棒性方面表现优异，适用于隐私敏感场景。

Abstract: Serial pipeline training is an efficient paradigm for handling data
heterogeneity in cross-silo federated learning with low communication overhead.
However, even without centralized aggregation, direct transfer of models
between clients can violate privacy regulations and remain susceptible to
gradient leakage and linkage attacks. Additionally, ensuring resilience against
semi-honest or malicious clients who may manipulate or misuse received models
remains a grand challenge, particularly in privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose TriCon-SF, a novel serial
federated learning framework that integrates triple shuffling and contribution
awareness. TriCon-SF introduces three levels of randomization by shuffling
model layers, data segments, and training sequences to break deterministic
learning patterns and disrupt potential attack vectors, thereby enhancing
privacy and robustness. In parallel, it leverages Shapley value methods to
dynamically evaluate client contributions during training, enabling the
detection of dishonest behavior and enhancing system accountability. Extensive
experiments on non-IID healthcare datasets demonstrate that TriCon-SF
outperforms standard serial and parallel federated learning in both accuracy
and communication efficiency. Security analysis further supports its resilience
against client-side privacy attacks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了无监督组合优化（UCO）中训练与测试不对齐的问题，并提出了一种通过引入可微分的去随机化方法改进对齐的初步想法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UCO方法中训练与测试存在不对齐问题，导致训练损失低不一定带来更好的去随机化性能。

Method: 在训练中引入可微分版本的测试时去随机化方法。

Result: 初步实验表明该方法改进了训练与测试的对齐，但也带来了训练上的挑战。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了UCO中训练与测试对齐的重要性，并提出了一种潜在解决方案，但需进一步解决训练中的挑战。

Abstract: In unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO), during training, one aims
to have continuous decisions that are promising in a probabilistic sense for
each training instance, which enables end-to-end training on initially discrete
and non-differentiable problems. At the test time, for each test instance,
starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to
obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and
more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical
performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a
misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods.
Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better
post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any
data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases.
We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by
including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our
empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test
alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.

<details>

Motivation: 传统手动检测成本高且易出错，机器学习有潜力替代，但现有方法在低质量数据和实际环境中表现不佳，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 评估了两种最先进的模型，用于识别和改进生产数据中的质量问题，无需新数据，并提供了识别模型或数据问题的实用指南。

Result: 论文揭示了基于似然方法的常见缺陷，并提出了更适合实际场景的实证风险估计框架。

Conclusion: 为从业者提供了在实际工业场景中识别和改进质量问题的实用工具和方法，强调了模型和数据质量的重要性。

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially
mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is
costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual
handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or
self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable
defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude
of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in
laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not
handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but
typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to
identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse,
often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may
give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle
anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather
low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We
specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to
identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to
obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners
that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or
invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar
scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of
likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk
estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

Result: 实验表明MHCL在多种图机器学习任务中优于现有基线，能有效捕捉异构图的复杂结构。

Conclusion: MHCL通过多双曲空间和对比学习，显著提升了异构图嵌入的性能。

Abstract: The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and
exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of
heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess
diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding
models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively
capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To
address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive
Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture
diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by
learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex
structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic
information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic
information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating
them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning
approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath
embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the
distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance
between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the
separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The
experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the
complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.

Conclusion: 多元平等框架为机器学习公平性提供了更全面的伦理基础，并提出了实际实施路径。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of
research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And
why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly
appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,
such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally
distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because
they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive
focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading
ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that
equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging
structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that
privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality
manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,
economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While
distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why
representational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce
social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --
and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals
(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a
multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both
distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political
philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for
tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also
outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML
pipeline.

Conclusion: SeLoRA是一种高效、可扩展的插件框架，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large foundation models. Despite its successes, the substantial
parameter redundancy, which limits the capacity and efficiency of LoRA, has
been recognized as a bottleneck. In this work, we systematically investigate
the impact of redundancy in fine-tuning LoRA and reveal that reducing density
redundancy does not degrade expressiveness. Based on this insight, we introduce
\underline{S}pectral-\underline{e}ncoding \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank
\underline{A}daptation (SeLoRA), which harnesses the robust expressiveness of
spectral bases to re-parameterize LoRA from a sparse spectral subspace.
Designed with simplicity, SeLoRA enables seamless integration with various LoRA
variants for performance boosting, serving as a scalable plug-and-play
framework. Extensive experiments substantiate that SeLoRA achieves greater
efficiency with fewer parameters, delivering superior performance enhancements
over strong baselines on various downstream tasks, including commonsense
reasoning, math reasoning, and code generation.

Motivation: GNN在深度增加时性能下降，现有初始化方法无法同时控制信号传播的三个关键指标。

Method: 提出SPoGInit方法，通过搜索优化权重初始化方差，同时优化前向传播、反向传播和图嵌入变化（GEV）三个指标。

Result: 实验证明SPoGInit在多种任务和架构中优于常用初始化方法，并能随着GNN深度增加提升性能。

Conclusion: SPoGInit有效解决了GNN深度相关挑战，验证了信号传播分析框架的有效性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from performance degradation as the
network depth increases. This paper addresses this issue by introducing
initialization methods that enhance signal propagation (SP) within GNNs. We
propose three key metrics for effective SP in GNNs: forward propagation,
backward propagation, and graph embedding variation (GEV). While the first two
metrics derive from classical SP theory, the third is specifically designed for
GNNs. We theoretically demonstrate that a broad range of commonly used
initialization methods for GNNs, which exhibit performance degradation with
increasing depth, fail to control these three metrics simultaneously. To deal
with this limitation, a direct exploitation of the SP analysis--searching for
weight initialization variances that optimize the three metrics--is shown to
significantly enhance the SP in deep GCNs. This approach is called Signal
Propagation on Graph-guided Initialization (SPoGInit). Our experiments
demonstrate that SPoGInit outperforms commonly used initialization methods on
various tasks and architectures. Notably, SPoGInit enables performance
improvements as GNNs deepen, which represents a significant advancement in
addressing depth-related challenges and highlights the validity and
effectiveness of the SP analysis framework.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for
tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than
ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even
if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are
released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously
maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually
curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models,
conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard,
and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the
influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations
to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are
still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep
learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At
the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show
that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine
learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch
TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance
protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

Conclusion: seq2GMM能有效识别异常时间序列，并通过理论分析和实验结果验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of
physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The
quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar
repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in
different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude
of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to
identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the
observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how
the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model
(seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify
unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We
further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently
train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a
plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the
convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical
results to substantiate our theoretical claims.

Abstract: Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is
impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within
their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large
language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and
semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials
science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest
inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can
extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to
build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine
learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e.
new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating
semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The
applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with
domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the
model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by
predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been
investigated.

Abstract: Rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models
have spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness tracking devices.
Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices can continuously capture physical
movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports
optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional centralized learning
approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with privacy concerns,
regulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast,
Federated Learning (FL) enables a decentralized model training by communicating
model updates rather than private wearable sensor data. Applying FL to FitTech
presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labelled data,
heterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization
and generalization. To simplify research on FitTech in FL, we present the
FedFitTech baseline, under the Flower framework, which is publicly available
and widely used by both industry and academic researchers. Additionally, to
illustrate its usage, this paper presents a case study that implements a system
based on the FedFitTech baseline, incorporating a client-side early stopping
strategy and comparing the results. For instance, this system allows wearable
devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activity
patterns and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the
scalability and efficiency of privacy-aware fitness tracking applications.
Results show that this reduces overall redundant communications by 13 percent,
while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible
recognition cost by 1 percent. Thus, FedFitTech baseline creates a foundation
for a wide range of new research and development opportunities in FitTech, and
it is available as open-source at:

Result: 实验表明，交叉验证方法在高样本量场景下优于传统正态规则。

Conclusion: 新型带宽选择器能更有效地利用数据信息，提升SPBNs的学习能力和适用性。

Abstract: Semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) integrate parametric and
non-parametric probabilistic models, offering flexibility in learning complex
data distributions from samples. In particular, kernel density estimators
(KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of
data normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the
KDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the
trade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates
from normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and
reduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical
framework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and
subsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the
approaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their
effectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs.
To support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package
PyBNesian for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and
conducted extensive experimental analyses. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively
than the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data.
In particular, unbiased cross-validation generally outperforms the normal rule,
highlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios.

Conclusion: SST结合了灵活性和可解释性，可扩展至群体公平性，是一种有效的生存分析工具。

Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability
and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the
timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built
through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in
globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the
error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree
model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a
nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs
provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a
single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit
the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with
interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or
nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf
node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are
associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15
well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based
semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the
node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft
regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four
widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended
to consider group fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示工程方法针对特定奖励配置，在新场景中表现不佳，需要一种灵活的方法适应不同奖励模型。

Method: RATTPO通过查询大型语言模型（LLMs）迭代优化提示，利用优化轨迹和奖励感知反馈信号（“提示”）作为上下文。

Result: RATTPO在多种奖励设置下有效提升提示质量，搜索效率比其他基线高3.5倍，性能接近需要微调的学习基线。

Conclusion: RATTPO是一种高效、通用的提示优化方法，适用于多样化奖励场景，无需特定任务描述或微调。

Abstract: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image
(T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function
specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating
image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically
target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs
exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios
involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce
RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time
optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without
modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying
large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task
descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel
reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results
demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts
across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as
aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects.
RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using
up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget,
achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require
reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为建模和学习事件触发时间序列相似性提供了系统化方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as
intrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among
multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for
downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the
event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric
is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and
clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised
learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of
event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the
proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution
sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively
learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the
obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The
proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a
systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of
event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods considerably.

Motivation: 解决神经网络深度优化的挑战，避免资源密集型实验。

Result: 理论证明了最优停止深度的有限性，实验验证了正则化项在提高计算效率的同时保持或提升模型准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络深度优化提供了理论支持，并通过正则化项实现了高效且准确的模型训练。

Abstract: Determining the optimal depth of a neural network is a fundamental yet
challenging problem, typically resolved through resource-intensive
experimentation. This paper introduces a formal theoretical framework to
address this question by recasting the forward pass of a deep network,
specifically a Residual Network (ResNet), as an optimal stopping problem. We
model the layer-by-layer evolution of hidden representations as a sequential
decision process where, at each layer, a choice is made between halting
computation to make a prediction or continuing to a deeper layer for a
potentially more refined representation. This formulation captures the
intrinsic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our primary
theoretical contribution is a proof that, under a plausible condition of
diminishing returns on the residual functions, the expected optimal stopping
depth is provably finite, even in an infinite-horizon setting. We leverage this
insight to propose a novel and practical regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm
depth}$, that encourages the network to learn representations amenable to
efficient, early exiting. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by
extending it to the Transformer architecture and exploring its connection to
continuous-depth models via free-boundary problems. Empirical validation on
ImageNet confirms that our regularizer successfully induces the theoretically
predicted behavior, leading to significant gains in computational efficiency
without compromising, and in some cases improving, final model accuracy.

Conclusion: 神经网络在特征学习的临界水平达到最佳性能，该水平取决于任务非平稳性，并适用于不同模型规模。

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in
non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting
(CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the
impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning.
We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by
differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable
parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is
only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more
laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the
infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and
characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy
regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task
non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only
beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by
task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low
forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our
findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical
level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers
across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of
scale and feature learning in continual learning.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习和深度学习技术预测新生儿死亡风险，LSTM模型表现最佳，准确率达99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球新生儿死亡率高，早期预测可降低死亡风险。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、KNN、随机森林、XGBoost、CNN和LSTM等算法，基于140万新生儿历史数据训练模型。

Result: XGBoost和随机森林准确率94%，LSTM准确率99%。

Conclusion: LSTM是预测新生儿死亡风险的最优方法。

Abstract: Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even some
developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000
births die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction
of endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to
take ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be
avoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a
newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4
million newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such
as logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term
memory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate
model for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms,
XGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while
among the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%.
Therefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict
whether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.

TL;DR: RocketStack是一种基于递归深度集成的框架，通过逐层修剪弱学习器、添加高斯噪声和特征压缩，实现了更深的堆叠集成，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统堆叠集成中因模型复杂性、特征冗余和计算负担而难以实现深度集成的问题。

Method: 提出RocketStack框架，包括逐层修剪、OOF分数随机化和周期性特征压缩（如注意力选择、SFE过滤和自动编码器）。

Result: 在33个数据集上验证，深度集成显著提升性能，二进制和多类任务分别达到97.08%和98.60%的准确率，同时减少运行时间和特征维度。

Conclusion: RocketStack通过修剪、压缩和推进策略，实现了高效的深度递归集成，为机器学习集成方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking
used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model.
However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal
diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and
computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware
recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking
levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally
prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without
excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian
noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against
strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions
are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE)
filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class),
linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and
the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the
strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild
OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the
strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no
compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached
98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing
runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression.
These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and
periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets
in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive
ensembling with tractable complexity.

Conclusion: 结论表明Transformer模型在ICL中存在局部化结构，能够解耦潜在概念，深化了对ICL和模型表示的理解。

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a
new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core,
latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of
whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation
or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on
ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the
relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the
considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this
work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show
that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model
successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept
composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find
low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics
the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our
understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide
evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent
concepts in ICL tasks.

Conclusion: 研究为离散组合生成任务提供了灵活的新视角。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in scientific discovery involves narrowing a large
combinatorial set of objects, such as proteins or molecules, to a small set of
promising candidates. While this process largely relies on expert knowledge,
recent methods leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance this filtering.
They achieve this by estimating proxy reward functions from available datasets
and using regularization to generate more diverse candidates. These reward
functions are inherently uncertain, raising a particularly salient challenge
for scientific discovery. In this work, we show that existing methods, often
framed as sampling proportional to a reward function, are inadequate and yield
suboptimal candidates, especially in large search spaces. To remedy this issue,
we take a robust RL approach and introduce a unified operator that seeks
robustness to the uncertainty of the proxy reward function. This general
operator targets peakier sampling distributions while encompassing known soft
RL operators. It also leads us to a novel algorithm that identifies
higher-quality, diverse candidates in both synthetic and real-world tasks.
Ultimately, our work offers a new, flexible perspective on discrete
compositional generation tasks. Code: https://github.com/marcojira/tgm.

Method: 通过比较17种先进图像生成模型，分析模型量化、分辨率、提示长度等因素对能耗的影响，并结合图像质量指标。

Result: 能耗差异显著，U-Net模型更节能，模型量化降低能效，分辨率影响不一致，提示长度无显著影响。高质量图像不一定能耗更高。

Conclusion: 研究为AI图像生成的能耗提供了实证数据，表明优化模型设计可兼顾能效与图像质量。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI image generation, in conjunction with the
ever-increasing environmental resources demanded by AI, we are urged to answer
a fundamental question: What is the environmental impact hidden behind each
image we generate? In this research, we present a comprehensive empirical
experiment designed to assess the energy consumption of AI image generation.
Our experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models by
considering multiple factors that could affect their energy consumption, such
as model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length. Additionally, we
consider established image quality metrics to study potential trade-offs
between energy consumption and generated image quality. Results show that image
generation models vary drastically in terms of the energy they consume, with up
to a 46x difference. Image resolution affects energy consumption
inconsistently, ranging from a 1.3x to 4.7x increase when doubling resolution.
U-Net-based models tend to consume less than Transformer-based one. Model
quantization instead results to deteriorate the energy efficiency of most
models, while prompt length and content have no statistically significant
impact. Improving image quality does not always come at the cost of a higher
energy consumption, with some of the models producing the highest quality
images also being among the most energy efficient ones.

Conclusion: MARL-OD-DA框架显著提升了MARL在大规模交通分配问题中的实用性和性能。

Abstract: The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands
impose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in
modeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics,
which is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face
challenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with
substantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in
solving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges,
this study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic
assignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair
routers rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability.
Additionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward
function based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution
reliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that
the proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with
extensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods.
When implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better
assignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than
that of conventional methods.

Abstract: Predictive artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve
clinical practice and patient outcomes, but risks perpetuating biases if
fairness is inadequately addressed. However, the definition of "fairness"
remains unclear. We conducted a scoping review to identify and critically
appraise fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI. We defined a "fairness
metric" as a measure quantifying whether a model discriminates (societally)
against individuals or groups defined by sensitive attributes. We searched five
databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records, to include 41 studies, and
extracted 62 fairness metrics. Metrics were classified by
performance-dependency, model output level, and base performance metric,
revealing a fragmented landscape with limited clinical validation and
overreliance on threshold-dependent measures. Eighteen metrics were explicitly
developed for healthcare, including only one clinical utility metric. Our
findings highlight conceptual challenges in defining and quantifying fairness
and identify gaps in uncertainty quantification, intersectionality, and
real-world applicability. Future work should prioritise clinically meaningful
metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法易于集成到学习框架中，为涉及不完整或不规则数据的机器学习方法提供频谱指导。

Abstract: Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent
challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain,
relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling,
therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that
enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled
data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD)
for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method
recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while
simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method
can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of
spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or
irregular data.

Abstract: Benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection commonly rely on
synthetically generated traffic, which fails to reflect the statistical
variability and temporal drift encountered in operational environments. This
paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1
dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly
detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that
transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the
CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The
resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011,
2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic.
  To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods,
including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are
compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical
results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally
static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In
contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing
improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic
benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets
with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model
implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and
reproducibility.

Abstract: Neural network model extraction has emerged in recent years as an important
security concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via
black-box queries. A key step in this process is signature extraction, which
aims to recover the absolute values of the network's weights layer by layer.
Prior work, notably by Carlini et al. (2020), introduced a technique inspired
by differential cryptanalysis to extract neural network parameters. However,
their method suffers from several limitations that restrict its applicability
to networks with a few layers only. Later works focused on improving sign
extraction, but largely relied on the assumption that signature extraction
itself was feasible.
  In this work, we revisit and refine the signature extraction process by
systematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical
limitations of Carlini et al.'s signature extraction method. These limitations
include rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome
these challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the
identified issues, greatly improving the efficiency of signature extraction.
Our approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than was previously
possible. We validate our method through extensive experiments on ReLU-based
neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth and
accuracy. For instance, our extracted network matches the target network on at
least 95% of the input space for each of the eight layers of a neural network
trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, while previous works could barely extract the
first three layers. Our results represent a crucial step toward practical
attacks on larger and more complex neural network architectures.

### [363] [From Concepts to Components: Concept-Agnostic Attention Module Discovery in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17052)
*Jingtong Su,Julia Kempe,Karen Ullrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAMD的方法，用于将复杂概念映射到Transformer模型的特定注意力头上，并通过SAMI策略调整这些模块的效果。实验表明该方法在语言和视觉任务中均有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer模型的解释性研究主要关注简单概念，忽视了注意力机制的作用，且缺乏统一的分析方法。本文旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 提出SAMD方法，将概念表示为向量并与注意力头计算余弦相似度，选择TopK头构建概念相关模块；提出SAMI策略，通过标量参数调整模块效果。

Result: 实验证明模块位置在训练前后稳定，SAMI能显著提升或抑制特定概念的效果（如安全性和推理能力）。

Conclusion: SAMD和SAMI为Transformer模型的解释性和行为控制提供了通用且有效的方法。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and
vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal
mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving
behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by
assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model
components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer
perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual
associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook
the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for
analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable
Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping
arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer
models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,
calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the
TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We
then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to
diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module
using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on
concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their
corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain
stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the
mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on
HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K
benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the
domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification
accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

*Abdellah Rahmani,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FANTOM是一个统一框架，用于处理非平稳过程和非高斯、异方差噪声的因果发现，同时推断多个因果结构和时间段的边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列中的因果关系分析在金融和神经科学等领域至关重要，但现有方法无法处理非平稳性和复杂噪声分布。

Method: FANTOM使用贝叶斯期望最大化算法，最大化数据对数似然的证据下界，同时推断时间段的数量和对应的因果图。

Result: 理论证明FANTOM在平稳和非平稳设置下均可识别，实验表明其在合成和真实数据上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FANTOM为复杂时间序列中的因果发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in
many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many
such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments
with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal
structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for
analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this
setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have
its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,
which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery
approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity
or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified
framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with
non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the
number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's
Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm
that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the
theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal
heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are
identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition,
extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms
existing methods.

Motivation: 多项式神经网络（PNNs）具有丰富的代数和几何结构，但其可识别性（确保可解释性的关键属性）仍未被充分理解。

Method: 通过将深度PNNs与低秩张量分解及Kruskal型唯一性定理联系起来，提出了构造性证明。

Result: 结果显示，在温和条件下，层宽度非递增的架构通常可识别，而解码器宽度增长不过快的编码器-解码器网络也可识别。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了由架构决定的通用条件，还给出了依赖于网络参数的有效条件，并解决了关于PNNs神经变种维度的开放问题。

Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric
structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring
interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including
architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate
interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving
identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with
non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions,
while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not
grow too rapidly. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection
between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type
uniqueness theorems. This yields both generic conditions determined by the
architecture, and effective conditions that depend on the network's parameters.
We also settle an open conjecture on the expected dimension of PNN's
neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for
it to reach its maximum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作系统中，快速连续评估合作者的可信度面临分布式设备、复杂环境和动态资源的挑战。

Method: 使用属性控制流图（ACFG）表示合作者的资源属性和历史数据，通过Siamese模型学习ACFG的语义并生成嵌入，计算相似度以评估信任值。

Result: 实验表明，SRCTE能快速收敛且异常信任检测率高。

Conclusion: SRCTE框架有效解决了协作系统中的动态信任评估问题。

Abstract: Trust is emerging as an effective tool to ensure the successful completion of
collaborative tasks within collaborative systems. However, rapidly and
continuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task
execution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex
operational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this
challenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust
evaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,
the communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a
trusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and
represented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures
trust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison
with data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,
the collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as
task completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with
an ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,
consisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to
learn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.
Finally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is
calculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A
real system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to
test the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results
demonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and
achieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline
algorithm.

Result: 在玩具系统、丙氨酸二肽等实验中验证了方法的有效性，并开发了一种支持模拟的先进Boltzmann模拟器。

Conclusion: 通过Fokker-Planck正则化，扩散模型在模拟中的一致性和采样效率得到显著提升。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their
effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When
trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both:
a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated
forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the
samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite
both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion
timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the
Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We
interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and
propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived
regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a
state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports
simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.

Conclusion: Sparse-Reg能有效解决小数据集中的过拟合问题，提升离线强化学习性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of
offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks
employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications
rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can
overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this
challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on
sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling
effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in continuous control.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical perspective that views deep
generative models as probability transformation functions. Despite the apparent
differences in architecture and training methodologies among various types of
generative models - autoencoders, autoregressive models, generative adversarial
networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and flow matching - we
demonstrate that they all fundamentally operate by transforming simple
predefined distributions into complex target data distributions. This unifying
perspective facilitates the transfer of methodological improvements between
model architectures and provides a foundation for developing universal
theoretical approaches, potentially leading to more efficient and effective
generative modeling techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学数据分析等领域，解耦表示对于泛化到新条件至关重要，但现有方法存在潜在表示泄漏问题。

Method: DISCoVeR采用双潜在架构、并行重建和最大-最小目标，无需手工先验即可实现干净分离。

Result: 在合成数据集、自然图像和单细胞RNA-seq数据上，DISCoVeR表现出更好的解耦性能。

Conclusion: DISCoVeR为多条件下学习解耦表示提供了一种理论严谨且实用的方法。

Abstract: Disentangled representations enable models to separate factors of variation
that are shared across experimental conditions from those that are
condition-specific. This separation is essential in domains such as biomedical
data analysis, where generalization to new treatments, patients, or species
depends on isolating stable biological signals from context-dependent effects.
While extensions of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework have been
proposed to address this problem, they frequently suffer from leakage between
latent representations, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen
conditions. Here, we introduce DISCoVeR, a new variational framework that
explicitly separates condition-invariant and condition-specific factors.
DISCoVeR integrates three key components: (i) a dual-latent architecture that
models shared and specific factors separately; (ii) two parallel
reconstructions that ensure both representations remain informative; and (iii)
a novel max-min objective that encourages clean separation without relying on
handcrafted priors, while making only minimal assumptions. Theoretically, we
show that this objective maximizes data likelihood while promoting
disentanglement, and that it admits a unique equilibrium. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DISCoVeR achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic
datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data. Together, these results
establish DISCoVeR as a principled approach for learning disentangled
representations in multi-condition settings.

Result: 得出了最佳泛化误差的紧下界，并找到了在某些条件下能实现该下界的最优凸隐式偏差。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，最优凸隐式偏差能够实现最佳泛化性能。

Abstract: Most modern learning problems are over-parameterized, where the number of
learnable parameters is much greater than the number of training data points.
In this over-parameterized regime, the training loss typically has infinitely
many global optima that completely interpolate the data with varying
generalization performance. The particular global optimum we converge to
depends on the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm. The question we
address in this paper is, ``What is the implicit bias that leads to the best
generalization performance?". To find the optimal implicit bias, we provide a
precise asymptotic analysis of the generalization performance of interpolators
obtained from the minimization of convex functions/potentials for
over-parameterized linear regression with non-isotropic Gaussian data. In
particular, we obtain a tight lower bound on the best generalization error
possible among this class of interpolators in terms of the
over-parameterization ratio, the variance of the noise in the labels, the
eigenspectrum of the data covariance, and the underlying distribution of the
parameter to be estimated. Finally, we find the optimal convex implicit bias
that achieves this lower bound under certain sufficient conditions involving
the log-concavity of the distribution of a Gaussian convolved with the prior of
the true underlying parameter.

Conclusion: 静态网络稀疏化是一种简单有效的方法，可显著提升深度强化学习的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Effectively scaling up deep reinforcement learning models has proven
notoriously difficult due to network pathologies during training, motivating
various targeted interventions such as periodic reset and architectural
advances such as layer normalization. Instead of pursuing more complex
modifications, we show that introducing static network sparsity alone can
unlock further scaling potential beyond their dense counterparts with
state-of-the-art architectures. This is achieved through simple one-shot random
pruning, where a predetermined percentage of network weights are randomly
removed once before training. Our analysis reveals that, in contrast to naively
scaling up dense DRL networks, such sparse networks achieve both higher
parameter efficiency for network expressivity and stronger resistance to
optimization challenges like plasticity loss and gradient interference. We
further extend our evaluation to visual and streaming RL scenarios,
demonstrating the consistent benefits of network sparsity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型（SLM）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是在高质量训练数据稀缺时。传统的SFT + RL方法在专家轨迹难以表达或模型初始化成功率极低时会完全失败。

Method: 提出BREAD方法，通过部分专家指导和分支展开统一SFT和RL阶段。当模型生成失败时，BREAD插入专家提示，确保每次更新至少包含一条成功轨迹。

Result: BREAD仅需不到40%的真实轨迹，性能优于标准GRPO，训练速度提升约3倍，并能解决SFT + RL无法解决的问题。

Conclusion: BREAD通过分支展开和专家指导显著提升了小语言模型的推理能力，为SLM训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors,
especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The
standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often
to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning
(RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose
methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate
that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are
too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's
initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these,
we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via
partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail,
BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model
to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update
includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the
reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer
than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while
speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that
BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT +
RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can
substantially boost SLM reasoning.

Motivation: 探索一种无需外部监督的强化学习方法，利用模型内部信号提升语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 采用RLIF方法，利用无监督奖励代理（如词级熵、轨迹级熵和自确定性）进行训练。

Result: RLIF在训练初期能显著提升推理性能，但后期性能下降，且对指令调优模型效果有限。

Conclusion: 内部反馈在训练初期有效，但需结合其他方法以克服后期性能下降问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training
large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require
extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods,
Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on
intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we
leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,
trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows
these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate
various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs
at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques
on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even
below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little
improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of
intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze
this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's
training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal
feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback
will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

Motivation: 解决现有方法需要完全可观测状态或队友动作的问题，适用于大规模环境。

Result: 在扩展到1M状态和2^125观测的基准测试中，RecBayes能有效识别团队和任务，并协助完成任务。

Conclusion: RecBayes在无需状态或动作信息的情况下，适用于大规模部分可观测环境。

Abstract: This paper proposes RecBayes, a novel approach for ad hoc teamwork under
partial observability, a setting where agents are deployed on-the-fly to
environments where pre-existing teams operate, that never requires, at any
stage, access to the states of the environment or the actions of its teammates.
We show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past
experiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and
tasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as
PO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some
stage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or
both, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the
environments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al.,
2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes
is both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either
states and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the
multi-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up
to 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at
identifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations
alone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks
effectively.

Motivation: 多智能体系统在不确定性下需要协调行动，而现有MAB框架假设奖励可独立获取，无法处理阈值激活奖励和诱饵臂的挑战。

Method: 提出T-Coop-UCB算法，通过去中心化方式联合学习激活阈值和奖励分布，避免诱饵臂的无效探索。

Result: 实验表明T-Coop-UCB在累积奖励、遗憾和协调指标上优于基线方法，接近Oracle性能。

Conclusion: 联合阈值学习和诱饵避免对复杂多智能体系统的可扩展去中心化合作至关重要。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent systems often face tasks that require coordinated
actions under uncertainty. While multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems provide a
powerful framework for decentralized learning, most prior work assumes
individually attainable rewards. We address the challenging setting where
rewards are threshold-activated: an arm yields a payoff only when a minimum
number of agents pull it simultaneously, with this threshold unknown in
advance. Complicating matters further, some arms are decoys - requiring
coordination to activate but yielding no reward - introducing a new challenge
of wasted joint exploration. We introduce Threshold-Coop-UCB (T-Coop-UCB), a
decentralized algorithm that enables agents to jointly learn activation
thresholds and reward distributions, forming effective coalitions without
centralized control. Empirical results show that T-Coop-UCB consistently
outperforms baseline methods in cumulative reward, regret, and coordination
metrics, achieving near-Oracle performance. Our findings underscore the
importance of joint threshold learning and decoy avoidance for scalable,
decentralized cooperation in complex multi-agent

Abstract: With the rise of distributed energy resources and sector coupling,
distributed optimization can be a sensible approach to coordinate decentralized
energy resources. Further, district heating, heat pumps, cogeneration, and
sharing concepts like local energy communities introduce the potential to
optimize heating and electricity output simultaneously. To solve this issue, we
tackle the distributed multi-energy scheduling optimization problem, which
describes the optimization of distributed energy generators over multiple time
steps to reach a specific target schedule. This work describes a novel
distributed hybrid algorithm as a solution approach. This approach is based on
the heuristics of gossiping and local search and can simultaneously optimize
the private objective of the participants and the collective objective,
considering multiple energy sectors. We show that the algorithm finds globally
near-optimal solutions while protecting the stakeholders' economic goals and
the plants' technical properties. Two test cases representing pure electrical
and gas-based technologies are evaluated.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效优化了编队重组过程，提升了安全性和效率。

Abstract: To enhance the ability for vehicle platoons to respond to emergency
scenarios, a platoon distribution reorganization decision-making framework is
proposed. This framework contains platoon distribution layer, vehicle
cooperative decision-making layer and vehicle planning and control layer.
Firstly, a reinforcement-learning-based platoon distribution model is
presented, where a risk potential field is established to quantitatively assess
driving risks, and a reward function tailored to the platoon reorganization
process is constructed. Then, a coalition-game-based vehicle cooperative
decision-making model is put forward, modeling the cooperative relationships
among vehicles through dividing coalitions and generating the optimal decision
results for each vehicle. Additionally, a novel graph-theory-based Platoon
Disposition Index (PDI) is incorporated into the game reward function to
measure the platoon's distribution state during the reorganization process, in
order to accelerating the reorganization process. Finally, the validation of
the proposed framework is conducted in two high-risk scenarios under random
traffic flows. The results show that, compared to the baseline models, the
proposed method can significantly reduce the collision rate and improve driving
efficiency. Moreover, the model with PDI can significantly decrease the platoon
formation reorganization time and improve the reorganization efficiency.

Result: 在SMAC、Overcooked-AI和Melting Pot等基准测试中，MRDG显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MRDG方法在多智能体协作与竞争中表现出色，为复杂适应问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting a single agent to a new multi-agent system brings challenges,
necessitating adjustments across various tasks, environments, and interactions
with unknown teammates and opponents. Addressing this challenge is highly
complex, and researchers have proposed two simplified scenarios, Multi-agent
reinforcement learning for zero-shot learning and Ad-Hoc Teamwork. Building on
these foundations, we propose a more comprehensive setting, Agent
Collaborative-Competitive Adaptation (ACCA), which evaluates an agent to
generalize across diverse scenarios, tasks, and interactions with both
unfamiliar opponents and teammates. In ACCA, agents adjust to task and
environmental changes, collaborate with unseen teammates, and compete against
unknown opponents. We introduce a new modeling approach, Multi-Retrieval and
Dynamic Generation (MRDG), that effectively models both teammates and opponents
using their behavioral trajectories. This method incorporates a positional
encoder for varying team sizes and a hypernetwork module to boost agents'
learning and adaptive capabilities. Additionally, a viewpoint alignment module
harmonizes the observational perspectives of retrieved teammates and opponents
with the learning agent. Extensive tests in benchmark scenarios like SMAC,
Overcooked-AI, and Melting Pot show that MRDG significantly improves robust
collaboration and competition with unseen teammates and opponents, surpassing
established baselines. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂社会挑战（如公共健康、职场诚信和环保行为）时，现有干预设计多关注短期效果，而忽略了状态的可持续性。

Method: 通过将低能量状态假设作为正则化机制嵌入干预优化中，设计了一种基于代理的模拟，以通勤者选择环保交通工具为例验证方法。

Result: 结果表明，低能量假设的嵌入能显著提高系统的韧性，确保行为状态在扰动下仍能保持。

Conclusion: 能量为基础的干预设计方法不仅有效，还能促进可持续的行为状态，为复杂社会系统干预提供了新视角。

Abstract: Addressing complex societal challenges, such as improving public health,
fostering honesty in workplaces, or encouraging eco-friendly behaviour requires
effective nudges to influence human behaviour at scale. Intervention science
seeks to design such nudges within complex societal systems. While
interventions primarily aim to shift the system toward a desired state, less
attention is given to the sustainability of that state, which we define in
terms of resilience: the system's ability to retain the desired state even
under perturbations. In this work, we offer a more holistic perspective to
intervention design by incorporating a nature-inspired postulate i.e., lower
energy states tend to exhibit greater resilience, as a regularization mechanism
within intervention optimization to ensure that the resulting state is also
sustainable. Using a simple agent-based simulation where commuters are nudged
to choose eco-friendly options (e.g., cycles) over individually attractive but
less eco-friendly ones (e.g., cars), we demonstrate how embedding lower energy
postulate into intervention design induces resilience. The system energy is
defined in terms of motivators that drive its agent's behaviour. By inherently
ensuring that agents are not pushed into actions that contradict their
motivators, the energy-based approach helps design effective interventions that
contribute to resilient behavioural states.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用粒子群优化（PSO）和遗传算法（GA）替代随机梯度下降（SGD）以解决其计算成本高和易陷入局部最优的问题，并提出了一种混合PSO-SGD策略。实验表明，该策略显著降低了训练误差。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGD在训练人工神经网络时存在计算成本高和易陷入局部最优的问题，因此研究PSO和GA作为替代优化方法。

Method: 开发了一种混合PSO-SGD策略，结合了PSO的全局搜索能力和SGD的局部搜索效率。

Result: 混合PSO-SGD策略将训练MSE中值降低了90%至95%，优于传统GA和PSO。RMHC也显著降低了MSE，而RS表现较差。

Conclusion: 混合和进化方法显著提升了训练效率和准确性，支持了Building Block Hypothesis（BBH）的有效性。

Abstract: Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) frequently encounters difficulties, including substantial computing
expense and the risk of converging to local optima, attributable to its
dependence on partial weight gradients. Therefore, this work investigates
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) - two
population-based Metaheuristic Optimizers (MHOs) - as alternatives to SGD to
mitigate these constraints. A hybrid PSO-SGD strategy is developed to improve
local search efficiency. The findings indicate that the hybrid PSO-SGD
technique decreases the median training MSE by 90 to 95 percent relative to
conventional GA and PSO across various network sizes (e.g., from around 0.02 to
approximately 0.001 in the Sphere function). RMHC attains substantial
enhancements, reducing MSE by roughly 85 to 90 percent compared to GA.
Simultaneously, RS consistently exhibits errors exceeding 0.3, signifying
subpar performance. These findings underscore that hybrid and evolutionary
procedures significantly improve training efficiency and accuracy compared to
conventional optimization methods and imply that the Building Block Hypothesis
(BBH) may still be valid, indicating that advantageous weight structures are
retained during evolutionary search.

Conclusion: NCA在自组织系统中的应用具有广泛潜力，本文为相关研究提供了见解。

Abstract: Cellular automata and their differentiable counterparts, Neural Cellular
Automata (NCA), are highly expressive and capable of surprisingly complex
behaviors. This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring
precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that
challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically,
this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that
transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply
them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a
promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from
ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and
training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs
applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing
systems.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应约束进化强化学习（ACERL）方法，用于动态物料搬运（DMH）问题，以最小化完成时间和延迟。ACERL通过多样化的探索、稀疏奖励处理和约束满足，显著优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物料搬运（DMH）问题需要实时分配任务，同时满足约束条件（如任务延迟）。传统方法难以应对动态事件和稀疏奖励，因此需要一种适应性强的解决方案。

Method: ACERL通过维护一组多样化的执行器（actors）进行探索，处理稀疏奖励和约束违反，并自适应选择最有价值的训练实例来优化策略。

Result: 在8个训练和8个未见测试实例上，ACERL表现优异，能够完全满足约束条件。在40个噪声实例上的实验进一步验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACERL在DMH问题中表现出色，其多样化和自适应机制显著提升了策略的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Dynamic material handling (DMH) involves the assignment of dynamically
arriving material transporting tasks to suitable vehicles in real time for
minimising makespan and tardiness. In real-world scenarios, historical task
records are usually available, which enables the training of a decision policy
on multiple instances consisting of historical records. Recently, reinforcement
learning has been applied to solve DMH. Due to the occurrence of dynamic events
such as new tasks, adaptability is highly required. Solving DMH is challenging
since constraints including task delay should be satisfied. A feedback is
received only when all tasks are served, which leads to sparse reward. Besides,
making the best use of limited computational resources and historical records
for training a robust policy is crucial. The time allocated to different
problem instances would highly impact the learning process. To tackle those
challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive constrained evolutionary
reinforcement learning (ACERL) approach, which maintains a population of actors
for diverse exploration. ACERL accesses each actor for tackling sparse rewards
and constraint violation to restrict the behaviour of the policy. Moreover,
ACERL adaptively selects the most beneficial training instances for improving
the policy. Extensive experiments on eight training and eight unseen test
instances demonstrate the outstanding performance of ACERL compared with
several state-of-the-art algorithms. Policies trained by ACERL can schedule the
vehicles while fully satisfying the constraints. Additional experiments on 40
unseen noised instances show the robust performance of ACERL. Cross-validation
further presents the overall effectiveness of ACREL. Besides, a rigorous
ablation study highlights the coordination and benefits of each ingredient of
ACERL.

Abstract: State-of-the-art transformer models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) rely
on temporal feature aggregation, yet advanced pooling methods remain
underexplored. We systematically benchmark pooling strategies, including
Multi-Query Multi-Head Attentive Statistics Pooling, which achieves a 3.5
percentage point macro F1 gain over average pooling. Attention analysis shows
15 percent of frames capture 80 percent of emotion cues, revealing a localized
pattern of emotional information. Analysis of high-attention frames reveals
that non-linguistic vocalizations and hyperarticulated phonemes are
disproportionately prioritized during pooling, mirroring human perceptual
strategies. Our findings position attentive pooling as both a performant SER

localization. On Interspeech 2025 Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic

Result: 实验证明，该方法能生成与4D场景一致的空间音频，无需训练。

Conclusion: Sonic4D显著提升了4D场景的沉浸式体验。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 4D generation have demonstrated its remarkable
capability in synthesizing photorealistic renderings of dynamic 3D scenes.
However, despite achieving impressive visual performance, almost all existing
methods overlook the generation of spatial audio aligned with the corresponding
4D scenes, posing a significant limitation to truly immersive audiovisual
experiences. To mitigate this issue, we propose Sonic4D, a novel framework that
enables spatial audio generation for immersive exploration of 4D scenes.
Specifically, our method is composed of three stages: 1) To capture both the
dynamic visual content and raw auditory information from a monocular video, we
first employ pre-trained expert models to generate the 4D scene and its
corresponding monaural audio. 2) Subsequently, to transform the monaural audio
into spatial audio, we localize and track the sound sources within the 4D
scene, where their 3D spatial coordinates at different timestamps are estimated
via a pixel-level visual grounding strategy. 3) Based on the estimated sound
source locations, we further synthesize plausible spatial audio that varies
across different viewpoints and timestamps using physics-based simulation.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method generates
realistic spatial audio consistent with the synthesized 4D scene in a
training-free manner, significantly enhancing the immersive experience for
users. Generated audio and video examples are available at

Abstract: To explore the potential advantages of utilizing spatial cues from images for

VS-Singer, a vision-guided model designed to produce stereo singing voices with

firstly, a modal interaction network integrates spatial features into text

to facilitate one-step sample generation. Moreover, we utilize the SFE module
to improve the consistency of audio-visual matching. To our knowledge, this

Conclusion: 该方法在提升构音障碍语音清晰度方面具有潜力，且效率更高。

Abstract: Dysarthria is a neurological disorder that significantly impairs speech
intelligibility, often rendering affected individuals unable to communicate
effectively. This necessitates the development of robust dysarthric-to-regular
speech conversion techniques. In this work, we investigate the utility and
limitations of self-supervised learning (SSL) features and their quantized
representations as an alternative to mel-spectrograms for speech generation.
Additionally, we explore methods to mitigate speaker variability by generating
clean speech in a single-speaker voice using features extracted from WavLM. To
this end, we propose a fully non-autoregressive approach that leverages
Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with Diffusion Transformers to learn a direct
mapping from dysarthric to clean speech. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of discrete acoustic units in improving intelligibility while
achieving faster convergence compared to traditional mel-spectrogram-based

Method: 提出AeroGPT框架，结合振动信号对齐（VSA）和生成式故障分类（GFC），直接输出可解释的故障标签。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异，DIRG数据集准确率98.94%，HIT轴承数据集达到100%。

Conclusion: AeroGPT展示了大规模模型在故障诊断中的潜力，显著提升了工业适用性。

Abstract: Aerospace engines, as critical components in aviation and aerospace
industries, require continuous and accurate fault diagnosis to ensure
operational safety and prevent catastrophic failures. While deep learning
techniques have been extensively studied in this context, they output logits or
confidence scores, necessitating post-processing to derive actionable insights.
Furthermore, the potential of large-scale audio models in this domain remains
largely untapped. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AeroGPT, a
novel framework that transfers knowledge from general audio domain to
aero-engine bearing fault diagnosis. AeroGPT is a framework based on
large-scale audio model that incorporates Vibration Signal Alignment (VSA) to
adapt general audio knowledge to domain-specific vibration patterns, and
combines Generative Fault Classification (GFC) to directly output interpretable
fault labels. This approach eliminates the need for post-processing of fault
labels, supports interactive, interpretable, and actionable fault diagnosis,
thereby greatly enhancing industrial applicability. Through comprehensive
experimental validation on two aero-engine bearing datasets, AeroGPT achieved
exceptional performance with 98.94% accuracy on the DIRG dataset and perfect
100% classification on the HIT bearing dataset, surpassing traditional deep
learning approaches. Additional Qualitative analysis validates the
effectiveness of our approach and highlights the potential of large-scale
models to revolutionize fault diagnosis.

Method: 引入VRVQ框架，动态调整比特率，优先处理关键语音成分并抑制噪声，同时集成特征去噪器提升鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，VRVQ在噪声条件下优于传统方法，实现了更高的压缩效率和感知质量。

Conclusion: VRVQ为噪声环境下的语音编码提供了更优的解决方案，显著提升了压缩效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) has become a dominant approach in neural
speech and audio coding, providing high-fidelity compression. However, speech
coding presents additional challenges due to real-world noise, which degrades
compression efficiency. Standard codecs allocate bits uniformly, wasting
bitrate on noise components that do not contribute to intelligibility. This
paper introduces a Variable Bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) framework for noise-robust
speech coding, dynamically adjusting bitrate per frame to optimize
rate-distortion trade-offs. Unlike constant bitrate (CBR) RVQ, our method
prioritizes critical speech components while suppressing residual noise.
Additionally, we integrate a feature denoiser to further improve noise
robustness. Experimental results show that VRVQ improves rate-distortion
trade-offs over conventional methods, achieving better compression efficiency
and perceptual quality in noisy conditions. Samples are available at our

Abstract: A learning-based method for estimating the magnitude distribution of sound
fields from spatially sparse measurements is proposed. Estimating the magnitude
distribution of acoustic transfer function (ATF) is useful when phase
measurements are unreliable or inaccessible and has a wide range of
applications related to spatial audio. We propose a neural-network-based method
for the ATF magnitude estimation. The key feature of our network architecture
is the input and output layers conditioned on source and receiver positions and
frequency and the aggregation module of latent variables, which can be
interpreted as an autoencoder-based extension of the basis expansion of the
sound field. Numerical simulation results indicated that the ATF magnitude is
accurately estimated with a small number of receivers by our proposed method.

Result: 实验显示HybridSep在多项指标上显著优于现有基准（如AudioSep、FlowSep）。

Conclusion: HybridSep为语言查询音频分离任务设定了新基准。

Abstract: Language-queried Audio Separation (LASS) employs linguistic queries to
isolate target sounds based on semantic descriptions. However, existing methods
face challenges in aligning complex auditory features with linguistic context
while preserving separation precision. Current research efforts focus primarily
on text description augmentation and architectural innovations, yet the
potential of integrating pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) audio
models and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) frameworks, capable of
extracting cross-modal audio-text relationships, remains underexplored. To
address this, we present HybridSep, a two-stage LASS framework that synergizes
SSL-based acoustic representations with CLAP-derived semantic embeddings. Our
framework introduces Adversarial Consistent Training (ACT), a novel
optimization strategy that treats diffusion as an auxiliary regularization loss
while integrating adversarial training to enhance separation fidelity.
Experiments demonstrate that HybridSep achieves significant performance
improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., AudioSep, FlowSep) across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于固定处理限制了用户根据艺术意图微调结果的能力，因此需要一种更灵活可控的解决方案。

Method: 引入ITO-Master框架，结合推理时间优化（ITO）动态优化参考嵌入，支持用户微调；探索了黑盒和白盒方法建模母带处理器。

Result: 通过客观评估、主观听测和CLAP嵌入的定性分析，验证ITO提升了风格相似性和适应性。

Conclusion: ITO-Master为用户提供了高效且可控的母带风格迁移解决方案，支持结果进一步优化。

Abstract: Music mastering style transfer aims to model and apply the mastering
characteristics of a reference track to a target track, simulating the
professional mastering process. However, existing methods apply fixed
processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the
results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the
ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that
integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over
the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference,
our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level
adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both
black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and
demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles.
Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative
analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that
ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability.
Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for
mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the
initial style transfer.

*Charilaos Papaioannou,Emmanouil Benetos,Alexandros Potamianos*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文评估了五种音频基础模型在六种不同音乐传统中的跨文化泛化能力，发现较大模型在非西方音乐上表现更好，但文化距离较远的传统表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型是否能泛化到多样化的音乐传统中，填补跨文化音乐信息检索的空白。

Method: 采用三种方法：探测模型固有表示、针对性监督微调1-2层、多标签少样本学习。

Result: 在六种数据集中五种达到最优性能，但针对性微调不总是优于探测。

Conclusion: 基础模型已编码大量音乐知识，但仍需改进以实现通用音乐表示。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized music information retrieval, but
questions remain about their ability to generalize across diverse musical
traditions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art audio foundation models across six musical corpora spanning
Western popular, Greek, Turkish, and Indian classical traditions. We employ
three complementary methodologies to investigate these models' cross-cultural
capabilities: probing to assess inherent representations, targeted supervised
fine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource
scenarios. Our analysis shows varying cross-cultural generalization, with
larger models typically outperforming on non-Western music, though results
decline for culturally distant traditions. Notably, our approaches achieve
state-of-the-art performance on five out of six evaluated datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models for world music
understanding. We also find that our targeted fine-tuning approach does not
consistently outperform probing across all settings, suggesting foundation
models already encode substantial musical knowledge. Our evaluation framework
and benchmarking results contribute to understanding how far current models are
from achieving universal music representations while establishing metrics for
future progress.

### [396] [Autonomous Trajectory Optimization for UAVs in Disaster Zone Using Henry Gas Optimization Scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15910)
*Zakria Qadir,Muhammad Bilal,Guoqiang Liu,Xiaolong Xu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于亨利气体优化（HGO）算法的集群优化方案（COS），用于无人机（UAV）在复杂环境中的最优轨迹规划，显著降低了运输成本和计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在灾害多发环境中，无人机需要快速规划最优轨迹以支持救援服务和网络连接，现有算法在复杂环境中表现不足。

Method: 使用HGO算法设计数学模型，并与PSO、GWO、CSA和BMO等现有算法进行对比。

Result: HGO算法在四种不同环境中均优于现有算法，特别是在普通环境中，运输成本降低39.3%，计算时间减少16.8%。

Conclusion: HGO算法适用于智能城市中无人机的自主轨迹优化。

Abstract: The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a disaster-prone environment plays
important role in assisting the rescue services and providing the internet
connectivity with the outside world. However, in such a complex environment the
selection of optimum trajectory of UAVs is of utmost importance. UAV trajectory
optimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time.
In this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry
gas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path
having minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical
model is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the
state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization
(PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and
barnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the
proposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient
environment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex
environment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms
the existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO
algorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8%
reduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the
HGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in
smart cities.

Method: 通过定性研究，对五位经验丰富的风电场工程师和维护经理进行结构化访谈，并采用主题分析法。

Result: 预测性维护模型能有效减少停机时间，但对小故障检测不足；数字孪生等技术提升了维护实践，但仍需改进。

Conclusion: 需持续开发技术以优化风机性能，推动可再生能源的普及。

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of predictive maintenance models and
the optimization of intelligent Operation and Maintenance (O&M) systems in
improving wind power generation efficiency. Through qualitative research,
structured interviews were conducted with five wind farm engineers and
maintenance managers, each with extensive experience in turbine operations.
Using thematic analysis, the study revealed that while predictive maintenance
models effectively reduce downtime by identifying major faults, they often
struggle with detecting smaller, gradual failures. Key challenges identified
include false positives, sensor malfunctions, and difficulties in integrating
new models with older turbine systems. Advanced technologies such as digital
twins, SCADA systems, and condition monitoring have significantly enhanced
turbine maintenance practices. However, these technologies still require
improvements, particularly in AI refinement and real-time data integration. The
findings emphasize the need for continuous development to fully optimize wind
turbine performance and support the broader adoption of renewable energy.

Result: 比强化学习快30%，比Lyapunov优化快60%，实现近最优性能。

Conclusion: 自适应策略显著提升了动态环境下的网络性能。

Abstract: Enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSN)
in dynamic and unpredictable environments requires adaptive communication and
energy harvesting strategies. We propose a novel adaptive control strategy for
WSNs that optimizes data transmission and EH to minimize overall energy
consumption while ensuring queue stability and energy storing constraints under
dynamic environmental conditions. The notion of adaptability therein is
achieved by transferring the known environment-specific knowledge to new
conditions resorting to the lifelong reinforcement learning concepts. We
evaluate our proposed method against two baseline frameworks: Lyapunov-based
optimization, and policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL). Simulation
results demonstrate that our approach rapidly adapts to changing environmental
conditions by leveraging transferable knowledge, achieving near-optimal
performance approximately $30\%$ faster than the RL method and $60\%$ faster
than the Lyapunov-based approach.

Conclusion: 自适应采样方法能有效预测稳定性边界，Thévenin等效模型在特定条件下可用，但需谨慎使用。

Abstract: This paper presents a detailed small-signal stability analysis of a modified
version of the Cigr\'e European high-voltage network, where one of the
synchronous generators is replaced by a grid-following inverter-based resource
(IBR). The analysis focuses on the influence of the parameters defining the
grid-following IBR control scheme on the stability of the system. Given a set
of potential grid configurations and the value of the IBR control parameters,
stability is verified by the direct eigenvalue analysis of a high-detailed
linearized model of the overall Cigr\'e network. Starting from this procedure,
we propose an adaptive sampling method for training a support vector machine
classifier able to estimate the probability of stability of the power system
over a domain defined by candidate intervals of the considered parameters. The
training of the classifier is refined to identify with more accuracy the
boundaries of the parameters' stability regions. The obtained results are then
compared with those obtained by representing the grid with the classical
Th\'evenin equivalent. Results suggest that, when the Th\'evenin equivalent is
accurate, the predicted stability region is conservative yet contained within
that of the full network.

Result: 模拟结果表明，无论规模大小，ESS均能有效参与碳减排目标。

Conclusion: 该框架为ESS参与碳市场提供了可行方案，支持更广泛的减排目标。

Abstract: Since the beginning of this century, there has been a growing body of
research and developments supporting the participation of energy storage
systems (ESS) in the emission reduction mandates. However, regardless of these
efforts and despite the need for an accelerated energy transition, we have yet
to see a practical framework for operational carbon accounting and credit
trading for energy storage systems. In this context, this paper proposes an
emission performance credits (EPCs) framework that allows ESS, down to the
prosumer level, to participate in the carbon market. Thus, a mechanism is
proposed, for the first time, to calculate the grid's real-time marginal
emission intensity (MEI). The MEI is then used to optimize the cumulative
operational emission of ESS through carbon-aware dispatch. Consequently, the
framework tracks the operational emissions and converts them into EPCs, which
are then sold to regulated entities under compliance programs. Simulation
results support the potential of ESS, regardless of their size, to participate
in the broader carbon mitigation objectives.

Motivation: 解决CLMRs在Ku波段因铝电极电迁移导致的功率处理能力不足问题。

Method: 开发数据驱动的热模型分析局部加热效应，并选用AlSiCu作为电极材料。

Result: AlSiCu电极的CLMRs无性能退化，Qm达360，QBode达500，kt2为6.3%，功率处理能力提升6 dBm。

Conclusion: AlSiCu电极显著提升CLMRs的功率处理能力，适用于高功率Ku波段滤波应用。

Abstract: This study presents power handling improvements in cross-sectional Lame-Mode
Resonators (CLMRs) designed for operation in the Ku-band. Previously fabricated
CLMR devices failed at approximately 8 dBm of input power, primarily due to
electromigration in the aluminum interdigitated electrodes (IDTs). To better
understand this mechanism in CLMRs, a data driven thermal model is developed to
analyze localized heating effects within the resonator body, which are known to
accelerate electromigration. Based on insights from this model, Aluminum
Silicon Copper (AlSiCu) was selected for the IDTs due to its superior thermal
stability and resistance to electromigration. Devices fabricated with AlSiCu
exhibited no signs of performance degradation, with the best-performing
resonator achieving a mechanical quality factor (Qm) of 360, a maximum Bode
quality factor (QBode) of 500, and an electromechanical coupling coefficient
(kt2) of 6.3%. Moreover, the use of AlSiCu significantly increased the maximum
input power the device can withstand, showing an improvement of up to 6 dBm
over previous devices. These improvements in power handling make the devices
strong candidates for high-power Ku-band filtering applications.

Abstract: Concerning general multi-agent systems with limited communication, this paper
proposes distributed formation control protocols under adaptive event-triggered
schemes to operate affine transformations of nominal formations. To accommodate
more practical system mechanics, we develop an event-triggered controller that
drives the leader to a desired state by bringing in the compensation term.
Based on triggering instants' state information, an affine formation control
method with adaptive event-triggering is designed for each follower, making the
whole protocol effective in refraining from successive communication while not
relying on predefined global information. In particular, mitigating the effect
of partial state availability, an output-based control solution is presented to
expand the protocol's serviceable range. Finally, we perform numerical
simulations on the formation and its affine transformations to verify the
effectiveness of the control protocol and the feasibility of the
event-triggered mechanism.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of designing a visual servo controller for a
multirotor vehicle, with the end goal of tracking a moving spherical target
with unknown radius. To address this problem, we first transform two bearing
measurements provided by a camera sensor into a bearing-angle pair. We then use
this information to derive the system's dynamics in a new set of coordinates,
where the angle measurement is used to quantify a relative distance to the
target. Building on this system representation, we design an adaptive nonlinear
control algorithm that takes advantage of the properties of the new system
geometry and assumes that the target follows a constant acceleration model.
Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed control
algorithm.

Result: 通过数值仿真验证了控制器在多种轨迹和初始条件下能保持跟踪性能且不违反执行器约束。

Conclusion: 该控制器放宽了对执行器能力均等的假设，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: All practical systems often pose a problem of finite control capability,
which can notably degrade the performance if not properly addressed. Since
actuator input bounds are typically known, integrating actuator saturation
considerations into the control law design process can lead to enhanced
performance and more precise trajectory tracking. Also, the actuators cannot
provide the demanded forces or torques instantaneously; hence, there is a
limitation on the rate of magnitude. This work proposes nonlinear feedback
controller designs developed using the Lyapunov stability and backstepping
method while actively considering the actuator magnitude and rate constraints.
The system dynamics are augmented with a smooth control input saturation model.
Additionally, an observer is incorporated to estimate the disturbance vector.
Through Lyapunov stability analysis, we demonstrate the system's stability
under the proposed controller for the Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV), ensuring
adherence to actuator constraints provided their initial values fall within the
prescribed bounds. Extensive numerical simulations performed by considering
various trajectories and multiple initial conditions demonstrate the
effectiveness of the controller in maintaining tracking performance without
violating actuator constraints. This work also relaxes the assumption of
equally capable actuators to be used to control the motion of USVs, affirming
the viability of the controller in practical applications.

Abstract: Recent work has proposed a universal framework that integrates the

Using this controller for the parallel operation of grid-forming converters,

additional loops manipulating the voltage magnitude, e.g., $QV$ and $PV$

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have an important role in the shift required to
achieve a global net-zero carbon target of 2050. Electrode manufacture is
amongst the most expensive steps of the LIB manufacturing process and, despite
its apparent maturity, optimised manufacturing conditions are arrived at by
largely trial and error. Currently, LIB manufacturing plants are controlled to
follow the fixed "recipe" obtained by trial and error, which may nonetheless be
suboptimal. Moreover, regulating the process as a whole to conform to the set
conditions is not widespread. Inspired by control approaches used in other film
and sheet processes, we discuss opportunities for implementing real-time
process control of electrode-related products, which has the potential to
reduce the electrode manufacturing cost, CO2 emissions, usage of resources by
increases in process yield, and throughput. We highlight the challenges and
significant opportunities of implementing real-time process control in LIB
electrode production lines.

Abstract: This paper introduces a universal power synchronization controller for
grid-side control of the wind turbine conversion systems in an offshore wind
farm with a diode rectifier in the offshore substation of the HVDC link. The
controller incorporates voltage-power droop controllers in the outer loop to
enable the operation of this setup. To effectively handle the impact of large
delays during black start and power ramp phases, virtual active and reactive
power quantities are defined. These quantities are computed based on the
current references prior to any modifications that might be needed to meet
converter current and voltage limits or source constraints. Utilizing them in
the outer loop ensures a balanced power sharing and a stable operation whenever
the original (unmodified) current references are not realized. Case studies
confirm the robustness of the proposed controller.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel physics-based model for signal propagation in
closed-loop molecular communication (MC) systems, which are particularly
relevant for many envisioned biomedical applications, such as health monitoring
or drug delivery within the closed-loop human cardiovascular system (CVS).
Compared to open-loop systems, which are mostly considered in MC, closed-loop
systems exhibit different characteristic effects influencing signaling molecule
(SM) propagation. One key phenomenon are the periodic SM arrivals at the
receiver (RX), leading to various types of inter-symbol interference (ISI)
inherent to closed-loop system. To capture these characteristic effects, we
propose an analytical model for the SM propagation inside closed-loop systems.
The model accounts for arbitrary spatio-temporal SM release patterns at the
transmitter (TX), and incorporates several environmental effects such as fluid
flow, SM diffusion, and SM degradation. Moreover, to capture a wide range of
practically relevant degradation and clearance mechanisms, the model includes
both local removal (e.g., due to SM absorption into organs) and global removal
(e.g., due to chemical degradation) of SMs. The accuracy of the proposed model
is validated with three-dimensional (3-D) particle-based simulations (PBSs).
Moreover, we utilize the proposed model to develop a rigorous characterization
of the various types of ISI encountered in closed-loop MC systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach to the advanced control of
continuous crystallization processes using model predictive control. We provide
a tutorial introduction to controlling complex particle size distributions by

traditional methods and another involving a spatially distributed crystallizer,
we demonstrate how our approach enables real-time model predictive control
while maintaining accuracy. The presented methodology facilitates the use of
complex models in a model-based control framework, allowing precise control of
key particle size distribution characteristics, such as the median particle
size $d_{50}$ and the width $d_{90} - d_{10}$. This addresses a critical
challenge in pharmaceutical and fine chemical manufacturing, where product
quality depends on tight control of particle characteristics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往模型常忽略十字轴惯性和界面摩擦，导致对万向节动态行为的描述不准确。本文旨在填补这一空白，为汽车、航空航天和精密医疗等领域的实时控制和精确建模提供支持。

Method: 采用基于Signorini条件和库仑摩擦的多值冲击定律，捕捉径向间隙引入的非光滑动力学特性，并通过2自由度轴系统的数值模拟验证模型。

Result: 模拟结果显示间隙对万向节动态行为有显著影响，包括冲击诱导振荡、准周期运动和混沌动力学。

Conclusion: 该模型为精确建模和实时控制提供了重要工具，尤其适用于高精度应用领域。

Abstract: This study presents a dynamic model of a universal joint (U-Joint) with
radial clearance, focusing on the rigid unilateral frictional contacts at the
crosspiece and yoke interfaces. Unlike previous models that neglect crosspiece
inertia and interface friction, this work incorporates these effects using a
set-valued impact law based on Signorini's condition with Coulomb friction,
capturing the complex non-smooth dynamics introduced by radial clearance.
Numerical simulations of a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) shaft system reveal the
critical influence of clearance on U-Joint dynamic behavior, including
impact-induced oscillations, quasi-periodic motion, and chaotic dynamics, which
are essential for accurate driveline modeling and real-time control in
automotive, aerospace, and precision medical applications.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: DeepRTL2是一个多功能LLM家族，首次统一了EDA中的生成和嵌入任务，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在EDA中的生成任务，而忽略了同样关键的嵌入任务，如代码搜索和功能等价检查。

Method: 提出了DeepRTL2模型，同时处理生成和嵌入任务，覆盖RTL相关的多样化需求。

Result: 实验表明，DeepRTL2在所有评估任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DeepRTL2为EDA提供了全面的解决方案，填补了嵌入任务的空白。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into electronic design
automation (EDA) has significantly advanced the field, offering transformative
benefits, particularly in register transfer level (RTL) code generation and
understanding. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which
are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These
tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality
equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for
accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap,
we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation-
and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad
range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive
solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we
show that DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated
tasks.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia
and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications
in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field
beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles,
while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency.
However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such
as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of
distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language
models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to
solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this
article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered
near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals
of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and
key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the
opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address
these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications
in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field
users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and
highlight several future research directions and open issues.

*Oliver Schön,Sofie Haesaert,Sadegh Soudjani*

Main category: cs.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概率模拟关系和替代模型的方法，显著提升了随机系统模拟关系的可扩展性和实用性，无需直接计算误差界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统表示方法复杂且难以扩展，影响了形式化方法的实用性和决策效率。

Method: 采用概率模拟关系和替代模型，避免直接计算误差界限，提供抽象化技术以处理高维复杂非线性交互。

Result: 方法在复杂高维车辆交叉案例中验证了其可扩展性和保守性之间的良好权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为随机系统提供了高效且可扩展的形式化保证，适用于复杂非线性交互场景。

Abstract: The requirement for identifying accurate system representations has not only
been a challenge to fulfill, but it has compromised the scalability of formal
methods, as the resulting models are often too complex for effective decision
making with formal correctness and performance guarantees. Focusing on
probabilistic simulation relations and surrogate models of stochastic systems,
we propose an approach that significantly enhances the scalability and
practical applicability of such simulation relations by eliminating the need to
compute error bounds directly. As a result, we provide an abstraction-based
technique that scales effectively to higher dimensions while addressing complex
nonlinear agent-environment interactions with infinite-horizon temporal logic
guarantees amidst uncertainty. Our approach trades scalability for conservatism
favorably, as demonstrated on a complex high-dimensional vehicle intersection
case study.
