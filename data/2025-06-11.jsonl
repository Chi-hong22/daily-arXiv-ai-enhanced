This requires\ndistinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing\npipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical\nsettings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional\nVital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any\ntarget waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or\narterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single\nmodel. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin\nTransformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture\ndistinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct\nmulti-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our\nframework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average\nacross all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and\nimproving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets.

These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which\ncontrol a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that\nthe model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In\nthis study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects\nin a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the\ndecoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative\ntraining modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space,\nbut also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is\notherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the\nimage-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach,\nwe propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the\npreviously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We\ncompare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and\ndemonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to\ndecompose overlapping objects.

However, there exists a class of state\nestimation problems with unknown statistical properties of noise disturbances,\nand it is worth discussing whether the invariant observer still has performance\nadvantages. In this paper, considering the problem of state estimation with\nunknown but bounded noise disturbances, an Invariant Zonotopic Set-Membership\nFilter (InZSMF) method on groups is innovatively proposed, which extends the\ninvariant filtering theory to the field of non-statistical filtering\nrepresented by set-membership filtering. Firstly, the InZSMF method transforms\nthe state space from the traditional Euclidean vector space to the Lie group\nspace to construct group affine discrete systems with unknown but bounded noise\nuncertainty defined by the zonotope on groups. Secondly, the nonlinear observer\non the group is defined and the corresponding linearized estimation error is\nderived. Then, two observer gain tuning algorithms under the InZSMF method are\nproposed, respectively, the pole configuration method and the F-radius\noptimization method. Finally, through simulation experiments, it is shown that\nthe InZSMF state estimation method is generally superior to the traditional\nZonotopic Set-Membership Filter (ZSMF) state estimation method. Especially,\nwhen the initial estimations are imprecise, the convergence speed of state\nestimation, the accuracy of set-membership center estimation, and the average\ninterval area of zonotopic estimation of the InZSMF method are significantly\nbetter than those of the ZSMF method."}

By incorporating large-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations\nof both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural\nnetwork predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and\nphysical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate\nsurgical maneuvers that simulate the use of standard laparoscopic tissue\ngrasping tools with high fidelity. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented\nlearning as a powerful and efficient strategy for real-time, physics-aware soft\ntissue simulation in surgical applications."}

However, the effectiveness of VLMs\nis highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise\nrecognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1)\nnoisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to\nmisinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual\ncontent. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data\nquality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data\nselection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE\nintegrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data\nentry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and\ntask-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates\nthe alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each\nentry based on the generated captions.

For instance, while a single decision tree is considered\ninterpretable, ensembles of trees (e.g., boosted trees) are often treated as\nblack-boxes.

Our analysis uncovers nuanced complexity\npatterns influenced by various factors. For example, we demonstrate that under\nstandard complexity assumptions like P$\\neq$NP, interpreting ensembles remains\nintractable even when base models are of constant size.

As a result, the\nlearned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.\nWe propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that\naddresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via\nlearned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target\ndomain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during\noffline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn\ndynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched\ndynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these\ndatasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY\nlearns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states\nand transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize\ntraining, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the\npolicy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that\nregularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather\nthan uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset.

We show\nthat we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any\ndiscrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete\ndiffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking\ndiffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate\ninductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that\noutperform masking."}

High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but\ntheir high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.\nThis challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which\ngenerate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are\ninherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To\novercome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches\nhave explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are\nsignificantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map\nconstruction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD\nmaps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach\nintroduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we\nincorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but\nadditional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this\nway, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the\ndependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,\nwe introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element\nidentifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on\nArgoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up\nto +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP\n(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

We hope our work\nwill help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation\nlearning."}
