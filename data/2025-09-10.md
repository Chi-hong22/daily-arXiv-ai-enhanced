### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应鲁棒的细胞形态基础表征，无需微调即可泛化到未见数据集，在批次整合和生物信号保留方面优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是关键障碍。

Method: 提出CellPainTR Transformer架构，采用源特定上下文令牌设计，能够有效进行分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于图像的谱分析创建真正的基础模型迈出了重要一步，实现了更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，结合图像和音频信息进行铁路缺陷检测，相比单模态方法精度提升0.2个点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态检测方法在铁路缺陷检测中存在误检问题，特别是当缺陷外观与正常结构元素相似时，需要多模态信息来提高检测精度

Method: 使用YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer从多个层级（7、16、19层）提取特征图，并与音频表示进行融合，专门针对铁路断裂和表面缺陷两类缺陷

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验表明，多模态融合相比纯视觉方法精度和整体准确率提高了0.2个点，t检验证实了统计显著性

Conclusion: 基于领域规则的多模态融合架构能有效提升铁路缺陷检测性能，证明了音频信息在视觉检测任务中的补充价值

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重的正交分解构建类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来识别分布外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，通过子空间投影实现了无需训练数据的优异性能，适用于数据隐私敏感场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，可以在小规模数据集上有效调整基础模型到新领域，无需标签和额外超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域中，可用数据集通常很小，限制了SSL方法的应用，且预训练模型通常只发布主干权重，缺乏继续预训练的重要信息。

Method: 提出DIET-CP策略，使用简单的目标函数，无需标签，不引入比监督微调更多的超参数，适用于不同数据模态和主干网络。

Result: 该方法稳定有效，仅使用1000张图像就能为DINOv3等最先进模型带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: DIET-CP为小规模专业领域数据集的持续预训练提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种联邦对抗提示调优方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题，显著提升联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法在跨客户端协作微调大型视觉语言模型时存在对抗攻击脆弱性，特别是在非IID设置下存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题。

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成全局对齐的视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同层间的提示耦合。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，通过全局标签引导和跨层共享策略实现了在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的差距，通过10个关键业务任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在7500个真实样本上评估开源VLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题和合成数据的基准测试无法反映企业实际应用需求，如社交媒体内容分析的复杂性，需要建立更贴近企业部署的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个业务关键任务，开发BlockWeaver算法用于无序OCR输出比较，构建包含7500个真实样本的基准数据集，结合语义匹配、传统指标和新颖方法进行综合评估。

Result: 在领先的开源VLM模型(Qwen、MIMO、InternVL)与专有基线的对比评估中，ViLD提供了首个基于行业实际需求的VLM能力评估，为企业在真实环境中的部署提供了可行见解。

Conclusion: ViLD框架成功弥合了学术评估与企业需求之间的鸿沟，通过真实业务场景的全面评估，为开源VLM模型在企业环境中的实际部署提供了有价值的指导和方法论支持。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901（基线0.847）和ECE 0.036（基线0.058），提高了跨模态和厂商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统传输，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响图像对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的神经网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部作为标签，通过三种方式学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据进行实验。

Result: 在三个临床任务上相比强基线方法（SimCLR、MAE和ImageNet迁移）获得显著提升：PE检测+0.046 AUROC，胶质瘤分级+0.058 AUROC，心脏肥大检测+0.041 AUROC，校准性改善25-37%，且在10-20%标注数据下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome能减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，提供了模型卡和部署指南，包括去标识化和偏差审计，虽然增益可能因任务而异，但在临床应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过构建中英文字符破坏测试集，发现现代视觉语言模型在识别破损文字时表现差异，显示了模型缺乏人类的组合性识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类对破损文字的鲁棒识别能力，并探索现代视觉语言模型是否具备相似的弹性识别能力。

Method: 构建中文象形字和英文字母词的平台，通过切割、重组和叠加字形创造"可见但不可读"的刺激物，测试模型在这些干扰下的表现。

Result: 当代VLMs在清洁文本上表现强劲，但在这些干扰下表现大幅下降，经常产生无关或不连贯的输出，显示出结构性限制。

Conclusion: 模型过于依赖通用视觉不变性，而不够依赖组合性先验知识，需要发展能够编码符号分割、组合和绑定的架构。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出在频域进行特征级学习，通过时间融合策略合成k空间数据，解决动态心脏MRI数据稀缺问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振成像具有动态复杂特性，高质量k空间数据稀缺，阻碍了稳健的重建

Method: 在频域进行特征级建模（而非传统图像域像素级卷积），利用傅里叶变换全局表示能力，集成多时间帧k空间数据融合策略

Result: 在低数据条件下表现出强大的生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法具有缓解动态MRI重建中数据稀缺问题的实际潜力

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个人机交互框架来定量评估LLM生成的3D模型，通过多模态输入和综合指标来提升生成保真度，代码级提示可实现完美重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLM生成3D模型几何和结构保真度的稳健方法，需要开发定量评估框架来支持CAD设计民主化、逆向工程和快速原型等应用。

Method: 提出包含体积精度、表面对齐、尺寸保真度和拓扑复杂性等综合指标的评估套件，使用L型支架作为案例研究，比较四种输入模态（2D正交视图、等距草图、几何结构树和代码级修正提示）的性能。

Result: 研究发现语义丰富度越高，生成保真度越好，代码级提示在所有指标上实现了完美重建。定量评估方法相比传统定性方法能显著加快向真实值的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还为验证和优化生成模型提供了可扩展的方法论，适用于各种CAD应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS²是一个针对3D高斯泼溅的内存优化框架，通过联合优化基元数量和每个基元的参数，实现了显著的内存压缩，在保持渲染质量的同时大幅降低显存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术在边缘设备上应用受限，主要因为高内存消耗。现有压缩方法大多只关注存储压缩，未能解决渲染内存的关键瓶颈问题。

Method: 1) 用轻量级的任意方向球面高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示；2) 提出统一的软剪枝框架，将基元数量和瓣数量剪枝建模为单一约束优化问题。

Result: 相比现有方法，MEGS²实现了50%的静态显存减少和40%的渲染显存减少，同时保持相当的渲染质量。

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化基元数量和参数效率，成功解决了3D高斯泼溅的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的正则化损失函数，通过空间域矩正则化和频谱域功率谱正则化的组合，强制潜在空间样本符合标准高斯分布，提升文本到图像模型的下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高斯性正则化方法存在局限性，需要一种更有效的方法来确保文本到图像模型潜在空间中的样本符合标准高斯分布，以支持各种下游优化任务。

Method: 将高维样本元素视为一维标准高斯变量，结合空间域矩正则化和频谱域功率谱正则化，通过随机排列输入确保排列不变性，构建复合损失函数。

Result: 该方法在生成建模中有效提升了美学质量和文本对齐效果，防止了奖励黑客问题，加速了收敛过程，性能优于现有高斯性正则化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架不仅包含现有高斯性正则化方法作为特例，而且提供了更高效和全面的解决方案，在文本到图像模型的潜在空间优化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Result: 得到优化版本SAM*，在微粒镜形容分割中表现更佳，支持实时流数据分析

Conclusion: 奖励函数优化框架能够提升基础模型在领域特定分割任务中的性能和适用性

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

the application of data distillation as an innovative approach to improve the
precision of streaming image data classification. By focusing on distilling
essential features from data streams, our method aims to minimize computational

Hoeffding Trees and Adap-tive Random Forest, adapted through embeddings for
image data. The Distillation Based Classification (DBC) demonstrated superior
performance, achieving a 73.1% accuracy rate, surpassing both traditional

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见，发现大型多模态模型会系统性地放大职业性别刻板印象，并存在默认男性偏见，但不同模型间偏见程度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在文本到图像生成方面取得了革命性进展，但存在延续训练数据中有害社会偏见的风险。先前研究发现了这些模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成刻板印象男性职业、刻板印象女性职业和非刻板印象职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张生成图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 1）LMMs系统性地再现并放大了职业性别刻板印象，在男性刻板印象职业中生成93.0%的男性图像，而在女性刻板印象职业中仅生成22.5%的男性图像；2）模型表现出强烈的默认男性偏见，在非刻板印象职业中68.3%的时间生成男性；3）不同模型的偏见程度差异很大，总体男性代表性从46.7%到73.3%不等。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了迄今为止最全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调了标准化、自动化评估工具对于促进AI开发中的问责制和公平性的必要性，高偏见并非不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于transformer的多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π³）虽然效果出色，但由于全局注意力层的二次复杂度，在处理大规模图像集时存在运行时瓶颈

Method: 通过经验分析发现注意力矩阵的概率质量集中在少量对应跨视图几何匹配的patch-patch交互上，受结构化注意力和大语言模型进展启发，使用高度优化的块稀疏核替换密集全局注意力操作

Result: 在多项多视图基准测试中，该方法实现了高达4倍的推理加速，同时保持可比较的任务性能，且无需重新训练主干网络

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏注意力方案有效解决了多视图重建transformer模型的扩展性问题，支持大规模图像集处理，为高效多视图重建提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势导致服务器端威胁面，细微的位姿欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时逃避启发式检查。

Method: 提出无监督、无标签的检测和恢复机制，在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动时间规律，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复以保持位姿一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试床上评估，多种欺骗强度下实验结果显示，与无防御基线相比，轨迹和位姿误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和恢复VIO系统中的位姿欺骗攻击，提高系统安全性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，旨在系统评估这些方法是否能通过降低检测准确率来发挥反取证作用。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和先进的基于GAN的增强技术，评估深度伪造检测器的鲁棒性，重点分析对朴素、空间和频域检测方法的影响，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 实验表明，即使是基础增强滤镜也能显著降低检测准确率（ASR达64.63%），而基于GAN的技术进一步利用这些漏洞（ASR达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，强调了需要开发更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Motivation: 监督学习需要大量标签数据，而实际应用中经常会出现未知的新类别。虽然现有研究主要集中在半监督方法，但这篇论文尝试通过全无监督方式来解决这个问题。

Method: 采用Vision Transformer生成向量嵌入，利用注意力机制估计聚类数量，并结合流形学习技术来精炼嵌入表征，以利用数据的本质几何特性提升图像聚类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合Vision Transformer和流形学习，成功实现了全无监督的新类发现，为开放世界问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种双提示双分支多模态模型，结合全局语义和局部边界精确性，通过自动生成的临床文本提示来提高乳腺超声分割的准确性，尤其在小症狂和低对比度症狂上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的乳腺超声分割对可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小症狂、低对比度症狂、模糊边缘和杂音使分割变得困难。文本提示能添加临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位文本-56fe像线索往往产生粗糕的分割结果。

Method: 提出XBusNet，一种新题的双提示双分支多模态模型。全局途径基于CLIP Vision Transformer，编码整体图像语义并基于症狂大小和位置进行条件化处理；局部U-Net途径重点关注精确边界，通过描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语的提示进行调制。提示从结构化元数据自动组装，无需手动点击。

Result: XBusNet在BLU数据集上达到最高水平性能，平均Dice系数为0.8765，IoU为0.8149，超过了6个强基线。小症狂显示出最大收益，缺失区域更少，假阻激活更少。分离研究显示了全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示基于调制的补充贡献。

Conclusion: 一种合并全局语义与局部精确性的双提示双分支多模态设计能够产生准确的乳腺超声分割面具，并提高小症狂、低对比度症狂的稳健性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Result: 达到98.0%准确率和98.1%敏感度，DPM增强效果优于传统方法和ProGAN基线，消融实验证明各组件统计显著

Conclusion: 验证了先进生成模型与可解释特征融合的协同作用，可创建高精度医疗诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖图像-文本对，但文本标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，导致理解与生成能力不匹配

Method: 利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为条件，通过自监督重建损失优化图像重建，实现理解与生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准也得到改善(ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25)，超越更大的开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于多种UMM架构，能够有效弥合视觉理解与生成之间的差距

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Motivation: 解决无人机多光谱目标检测面临的三个挑战：低光照遥感图像降低多模态融合互补性、局部小目标建模在融合阶段易受冗余信息干扰、基于Transformer的方法二次计算复杂度难以在无人机平台应用

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上，DEPF在目标检测方面表现优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于线性复杂度的Mamba架构，DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，在保持高性能的同时降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试中显著提升动作识别性能，特别是对模糊样本效果明显

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN方法具有强泛化能力，能有效解决骨架动作识别中的模糊动作区分问题

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL模型，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部分。GM让高语义节点引导低语义节点的特征更新，通过递归双向交叉注意力和净化实现有效信息融合

Result: 在主要姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和相应网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过解析图引导的视觉-语言交互，有效解决了遮挡场景下的姿态估计问题，代码即将发布

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型层，LGAA Switcher整合多个扩散先验，LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯溅射，最后通过后处理提取高质量可重光照网格资产。

Result: 在文本和图像条件多视角扩散模型上表现出优越性能，模块化设计支持灵活整合多个扩散先验，仅需6.9万多视角实例即可高效收敛。

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成，通过知识保留方案实现了数据高效训练，为自动化3D资产创建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准测试，利用注视信息提升多模态大语言模型对第一人称视频的理解能力，通过注视引导的意图提示方法显著改善性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽略了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，第一人称视频通过统一坐标系直接捕捉用户焦点、动作和上下文，为MLLMs提供实现主动个性化AI体验的机会

Method: 构建包含注视引导QA对的EgoGazeVQA基准，采用注视引导的意图提示方法整合空间、时间和意图相关线索，并进行注视相关的微调实验

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确解释用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升性能，注视估计准确性影响提示效果

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在第一人称场景中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Method: 提出GLEAM-C基础模型，通过与卫星图像对齐来统一UAV、街道地图、全景图和地面照片等多模态多视角数据，采用两阶段训练策略。GLEAM-X利用多模态大语言模型的推理能力进行可解释性分析，并构建双语评测数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究构建了一个包含多模态多视角对齐和可解释性分析的完整CVGL流程，提升了地理定位的透明性和可扩展性，让模型能够更好地解释和匹配。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合实现层感知的OCT到OCTA血管重建，显著提升了视网膜血管重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取困难且成本高，现有深度学习方法忽略了视网膜不同层的血管差异，难以重建临床诊断所需的精细血管细节。

Method: 提出跨维度监督模块利用2D分层投影作为监督信号，结合多尺度特征融合模块通过通道重加权策略增强血管描绘能力。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上实验证明XOCT显著提升了en-face投影的重建质量，这对视网膜病理的临床评估至关重要。

Conclusion: XOCT框架有望提高OCTA的可及性、可靠性和诊断价值，促进眼科疾病的检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘技术的后处理偏置缓解方法，通过在三个基准数据集上的实验证明，该方法能显著减少子群体差异，提升模型公平性，且准确率损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练数据中往往依赖虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏见或不公平的预测。传统的偏置缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种有前景的后处理模型修正替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法，在CUB-200-2011（姿态偏置）、CIFAR-10（合成补丁偏置）和CelebA（微笑检测中的性别偏置）三个基准数据集上进行实证分析。

Result: 后处理遗忘能显著减少子群体差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性提升94.86%，CIFAR-10上提升30.28%，CelebA上提升97.37%。这些提升以最小的准确率损失实现，方法在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分0.62。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明机器遗忘是一个实用的框架，可以在不需要完全重新训练的情况下增强已部署视觉系统的公平性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

Conclusion: ANYPORTAL提供了一个实用高效的视频内容创作和编辑解决方案，解决了前景一致性和时间连贯重新光照的挑战

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without

MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在渲染方面效果出色，但由于表示的非结构化和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建

Method: 将SDF学习直接集成到3DGS流程中，为每个高斯关联可学习的SDF值，并设计几何引导的网格增长策略在多尺度层次下自适应分布高斯

Conclusion: DiGS通过结合SDF学习有效解决了3DGS的表面重建挑战，实现了几何一致性和渲染质量的统一提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种通过局部混合和logits优化的新题对抗性攻击框架，解决了现有混合策略破坏全局语义特征和梯度消失的问题，在遥感图像数据集上实现了更高的黑盒攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易受到对抗性攻击，对遥感感知应用构成安全威胁。当前的混合基础攻击策略存在两个主要问题：全局混合破坏语义特征，以及cross-entropy损失导致梯度消失影响对抗性示例质量。

Method: 1. 局部混合策略：仅混合局部区域保持全局语义一致性，不同于MixUp全局混合和MixCut缩绷图像
2. Logit损失优化：将目标攻击中的logit损失适配到非目标攻击场景，缓解梯度消失问题
3. 干扰平滑损失：压制高频噪声提高转移性

Result: 在FGSCR-42和MTARSI数据集上进行了广泛实验，超越了12种最新方法在6个代理模型上的表现。以ResNet作为代理模型在MTARSI上，该方法实现了黑盒攻击成功率平均17.28%的提升。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的局部混合和logits优化框架有效解决了对抗性攻击中的语义保持和梯度消失问题，显著提高了遥感图像应用中对抗性示例的转移性和攻击效果。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，现有弱监督方法仅依赖2D框标注存在投影歧义和部分可见性问题，需要开发更有效的弱监督3D检测方法

Method: 提出MVAT框架：1）跨时间聚合目标中心点云构建完整3D表示；2）采用教师-学生蒸馏范式，教师网络从单视图学习但目标来自时序聚合的静态对象；3）引入多视图2D投影损失确保3D框与所有可用2D标注的一致性

Conclusion: MVAT通过有效利用时序多视图信息和蒸馏学习范式，成功解决了弱监督3D检测中的关键挑战，为降低3D标注成本提供了可行方案

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Result: 数据集包含6小时1100+个录制，支持手势分类、手势触发检测和动作质量评估的基线实验。

Conclusion: EHWGesture可作为推进多模态临床手势理解的综合基准数据集。

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

TL;DR: UFC是一个通用的少样本控制适配器，能够在少量标注样本下快速适应新的空间控制任务，在多种扩散模型架构上都能实现精细的空间控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的空间控制适配器在面对与训练任务差异较大的新空间控制条件时，适应能力有限且训练成本高昂。

Method: 提出UFC方法，通过查询条件和支持条件之间的类比来构建任务特定的控制特征，使用匹配机制和少量任务特定参数的更新来实现泛化。

Result: 在6个新空间控制任务上，仅用30个标注样本微调就能实现与空间条件一致的精细控制，使用0.1%的全训练数据就能达到与全监督基线相当的性能。

Conclusion: UFC是一个通用且高效的少样本空间控制适配器，适用于多种扩散模型架构，为解决新空间控制任务的快速适应问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

Motivation: 传统MIM方法在3D医学图像中使用随机掩码，忽略了解剖结构的密度特征，无法有效利用医学图像的领域知识

Method: 利用Hounsfield Unit (HU)测量值实现基于强度的前景掩码，专注于内脏器官的强度分布，排除空气和液体等无诊断意义的非组织区域

Result: 在5个公开3D医学影像数据集上取得显著性能提升：BTCV(~84.64%)、Flare22(~92.43%)、MM-WHS(~90.67%)、Amos22(~88.64%)、BraTS(~78.55%)

Conclusion: 基于领域知识的MIM方法在医学图像分割中具有重要价值，为医学图像表示学习提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Motivation: 解决从单张非摄影机位图像重建3D头部模型时的效率和质量问题，避免传统GAN逆向化方法的耗时问题，并克服真实3D数据缺乏的挑战。

Method: 提出了一个前向传播框架，通过综合结构化球面三平面特征和非结构化点基特征的双支架构，使用由3D GANs生成的大规模合成数据进行训练，并采用由粗到细的高斯头部生成流程。

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在高斯头部重建方面比现有方法更有效，能够实现高效的重建和渲染。

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架能够从单张非摄影机位图像高效地重建高质量的高斯全头部模型，为3D头部重建领域提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前视觉语言模型的性别偏见评估存在严重问题，非性别特征（如物体和背景）的微小扰动会显著扭曲偏见评分，表明现有评估方法可能反映的是模型对虚假特征而非真实性别偏见的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实图像的性别偏见评估基准往往包含性别与非性别特征之间的虚假相关性，这可能导致性别偏见评估的失真，需要系统研究虚假特征对偏见评估的影响。

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）中的非性别特征，包括物体掩蔽和背景模糊等操作，量化这些扰动对各种视觉语言模型偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使最小程度的扰动（如掩蔽10%的物体或轻微模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见分数，生成式视觉语言模型的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%，表明当前偏见评估往往反映的是模型对虚假特征的响应而非真实性别偏见。

Conclusion: 由于创建无虚假特征的基准具有根本性挑战，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据高效的微调流水线，成功解决了医疗视觉-语言模型在3D医学形态上的应用挑战，为阿尔茫海默病诊断提供了一种简洁而有效的新方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地解决标签数据依赖和可解释性问题，为神经退行性疾病的自监督学习诊断提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Result: 在各种攻击场景下达到最高检测准确率，同时保持优秀的FID和CLIP图像保真度指标。

Conclusion: SFW框架有效平衡了语义水印的稳健性和图像保真度之间的特性交换。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Conclusion: 该方法既有效又具有通用性，证明了通过张量低秩背景建模和小目标稀疏分解的深度学习框架的优越性

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Conclusion: 方法在深度差异场景中表现优异，具有良好的计算效率和泛化能力，超越了现有深度学习方法

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，显式处理类间特征接近性对于增强深度神经网络的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，理论分析显示该方法通过降低Lipschitz常数和Rademacher复杂度来改善泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Motivation: 当前视频理解模型在复杂推理任务上表现不佳，需要将现有感知能力应用于更复杂的视频理解任务。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为主动机器人，动态调用视频模块作为子工具，并使用批判器机制识别成功与否的执行序列。

Result: 在LVBench、Neptune和ActivityNet-RTL等复杂视频理解数据集上取得了强劲的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过组合动态模块调用和批判器机制，可以有效利用现有感知能力来处理复杂的视频理解任务。

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC提出了一种基于语义分割的多熵模型无损图像压缩方法，通过为不同语义区域分配专用熵模型来提升压缩性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习方法使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法有效捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域，为每个区域分配专用熵模型，采用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，同时仅引入最小的编解码延迟，支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，显著提升了无损图像压缩性能，为不同语义区域提供更准确的概率分布估计

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Motivation: 中风是全球第二大死因，复发率高且死亡率极高(40%)，通过早期识别高危患者可以有效降低复发率

Method: 收集3D脱内CTA图像数据和临床数据，训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二类分类(任务1)和生存时间预测(任务2)

Result: 多模态XSRD-net模型在测试集上获得c-index 0.68和AUC 0.71，识别出心脏疾病(表格数据)和颈动脉(图像)之间的关联性

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习模型能够有效预测中风复发风险，为临床决策提供重要依据，将继续收集数据以优化模型

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Conclusion: 该方法为头发重建提供了高效的解决方案，特别在保持发丝连通性方面有显著改进

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Motivation: RayGauss在合成和室内场景的新视角合成中达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本阻碍了在真实世界场景中的实时渲染。

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空空间跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线连贯性、尺度正则化减少误报交集，并提出新的致密化准则改善远距离区域的密度分布。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），视觉质量提升高达+0.56 dB PSNR。

Conclusion: RayGaussX在保持高质量渲染的同时显著提升了训练和推理效率，适用于大规模真实世界场景的实时渲染。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Motivation: 在医学MR成像中，需要在扫描时间和图像质量之间取得平衡。传统方法需要放射科医生分别分析低分辨率扫描，耗时且可能导致不准确的解读。

Method: 使用自监督多视角神经网络，引入稀疏坐标损失函数，支持任意缩放比例的低分辨率图像融合。结合患者无关的离线阶段和患者特定的在线阶段。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效融合正交低分辨率MR图像，实现高质量的超分辨率重建，显著提升重建速度，同时保持或改善图像质量。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种基于深度引导的3D高斯泼溅场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知优化，实现了最先进的感知质量和效率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能创建逼真的3D场景表示，但在修复遮挡或编辑导致的缺失区域时仍存在模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致的问题

Method: 结合两种关键思想：(1)联合深度和对象监督确保修复的高斯点准确放置在3D空间中并与周围几何对齐；(2)一致性感知细化方案选择性识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其他部分

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill在视觉保真度上超越了现有的NeRF和3DGS修复方法，同时减少了24.5%的训练时间，能提供更清晰的细节、更少的伪影和更好的视角一致性

Conclusion: SplatFill为3D高斯泼溅场景修复提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，在保持几何一致性的同时显著提升了修复效果

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的3D物体分割方法存在表示对齐问题：LLM处理高级语义token而3D点云只有密集几何结构，这限制了输入输出的有效性

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)框架，包含Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习对象中心token，以及Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合语义推理和密集特征进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理有效解决了LLM与3D点云之间的表示对齐问题，实现了鲁棒的3D理解

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test

ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting

Conclusion: 通过细粒度的注意力诊断和动态校正，D-LEAF能有效解决MLLM中的幻觉问题，且具有任务无关性和低开销优势

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect

Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency

Motivation: 现有方法主要建立支持目标对象与整个查询图像之间的图像级相关性，但这种相关性包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（无关背景对象），导致背景过拟合

Method: 设计对象级相关网络(OCNet)，包含通用对象挖掘模块(GOMM)和相关构建模块(CCM)。GOMM通过学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用对象特征，CCM通过分配目标原型来匹配通用对象特征建立对象级相关性

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程建立对象级相关性，能够有效挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，在少样本语义分割任务中表现优异

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: 通过两次递归适应性推理算法解决消费级硬件上对象检测的系统级性能瓶颈，在RTX 4060笔记本上实现1.85x速度提升，mAP仅下降5.51%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对象检测器在消费级硬件上实际性能与标准测试差距较大，性能受到系统级瓶颈限制而非计算能力限制

Method: 提出两次递归适应性推理算法，先使用快速低分辨率通道，仅在检测信心度低时才升级到高分辨率模型通道，无需模型结构改动

Result: 在COCO 5000张图片数据集上，相比PyTorch Early-Exit基准线速度提升1.85倍，mAP仅下降5.51%，在RTX 4060笔记本上验证效果

Conclusion: 通过从纯粹模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略，可以在消费级设备上部署高性能实时AI，提供了可复现的实践蓝图

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于引导扩散模型的解码器，能够生成与用户指定特征高度匹配的图像，用于分析深度神经网络的特征空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的特征提取过程具有黑盒特性，难以理解其内部特征编码机制。现有研究缺乏能够保证生成图像特征与指定特征紧密匹配的方法。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中，通过最小化估计图像特征与用户指定特征之间的欧几里得距离来指导生成过程。

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器，生成图像的特征与指定特征高度相似，揭示了这些DNN特征空间的有价值见解。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解神经网络特征编码提供了有效工具。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在规模、多样性和推理深度方面存在局限，特别是在渲染表格图像方面存在明显不足，需要构建更全面的评估数据集。

Method: 采用模块化、可扩展的全自动生成流水线，多个推理LLM协作完成生成、验证和启发角色，通过跨模型提示和LLM评审过滤实现多模型协作数据生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，在Visual-TableQA上微调的模型能够很好地泛化到外部基准测试，性能优于多个专有模型，尽管数据集是合成的。

Conclusion: Visual-TableQA为视觉表格推理提供了有效的评估基准，其生成方法展示了合成数据在提升模型性能方面的潜力，相关资源已公开提供。

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: Mini-o3是一个通过扩展工具交互和多轮推理来解决视觉搜索任务的系统，在有限交互轮次训练下实现了数十步推理，在挑战性视觉搜索任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型存在推理模式单调、交互轮次有限的问题，无法处理需要试错探索的困难任务。

Method: 构建视觉探针数据集、开发迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理轨迹、提出超轮次掩码策略平衡训练效率和测试可扩展性。

Result: 模型在仅6轮交互训练下，推理时可自然扩展到数十轮，准确率随轮次增加而提升，产生丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径。

Conclusion: Mini-o3通过规模化工具交互和多轮深度推理，有效解决了挑战性视觉搜索问题，展示了强大的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Motivation: 解决机器人操作中从单张参考图像估计任意未见物体6D位姿的挑战性问题，特别是在3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度以及生成模型与真实图像存在域差距的情况下。

Method: 提出包含两个关键组件的流程：1）粗到细对齐模块，结合多视图特征匹配和渲染比较细化来联合优化尺度和位姿；2）文本引导的生成域随机化策略，通过多样化纹理实现合成数据上的有效位姿估计器微调。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的一次性6D位姿估计，验证了在实际操作中的实用性，为机器人处理现实世界实例的长尾问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过视觉表示对齐来增强多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的正则化策略，通过将MLLM的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型对齐，保留关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如目标计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致训练过程中丢失细粒度视觉细节

Method: 提出VIRAL正则化策略，将MLLM的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型（VFMs）的表示进行显式对齐，使模型能够保留输入视觉编码器的关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识

Result: 实验表明在广泛采用的多模态基准测试的所有任务上都取得了持续改进，并通过全面的消融研究验证了关键设计选择

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在MLLM训练中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种并行化水平的机器人多指抓取框架，通过同时规划多个抓取目标路径并选择最佳抓取，解决了传统框架中时间消耗大或抓取成功率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的生成器-评估器-规划器框架存在两难困境：要么苛费大量时间进行多次路径规划，要么放宽规划精度导致抓取成功率估计准确性下降。需要一种更高效的方法来提高自主多指抓取的性能。

Method: 提出了一种并行化框架：同时规划多个抓取目标的运动路径，然后通过评估器估计每条路径的抓取成功概率，最终执行成功概率最高的路径。使用向量化运动规划器来高效实现多个目标的并行规划。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在不同物体、不同生成器和不同运动规划器下都显著提升了传统框架的性能，并成功泛化到真实世界的新环境中，包括不同的货架和桌子高度。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的并行化抓取规划框架有效解决了传统方法的性能瓶颈，在提高效率的同时保证了抓取成功率的准确性，为机器人自主抓取提供了更加高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous multi-finger grasping is a fundamental capability in robotic
manipulation. Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend
to be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an
alternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A
generator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,
and a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the
planner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started
with the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing
lower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple
trajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the
threshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a
successful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success
likelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a
successful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a
framework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in
parallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting
trajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To
plan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a
vectorized motion planner. Our experiments show our approach improves over the
traditional generator-evaluator-planner framework across different objects,
generators, and motion planners, and successfully generalizes to novel
environments in the real world, including different shelves and table heights.

Conclusion: 建立了量子计算与机器人学问题之间的基础性量子原生框架，为机器人运动学优化提供了有效的量子解决方案

Abstract: Optimizing high-degree of freedom robotic manipulators requires searching
complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces, a task that is computationally
challenging for classical methods. This paper introduces a quantum native
framework that integrates quantum machine learning with Grover's algorithm to
solve kinematic optimization problems efficiently. A parameterized quantum
circuit is trained to approximate the forward kinematics model, which then
constructs an oracle to identify optimal configurations. Grover's algorithm
leverages this oracle to provide a quadratic reduction in search complexity.
Demonstrated on 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm manipulator tasks, the method
achieves significant speedups-up to 93x over classical optimizers like Nelder
Mead as problem dimensionality increases. This work establishes a foundational,
quantum-native framework for robot kinematic optimization, effectively bridging
quantum computing and robotics problems.

Abstract: This chapter extends the family of perception-informed gap-based local
planners to dynamic environments. Existing perception-informed local planners
that operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical
robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of
dynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses
dynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar
regions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are
estimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.
Then, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap
propagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.
Lastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories
that are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally,
obstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps
exist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners
are benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in
dynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other
baselines in all environments. Furthermore, dynamic gap is deployed on a
TurtleBot2 platform in several real-world experiments to validate collision
avoidance behaviors.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of a point-cloud-based navigation
stack, MUONS, for autonomous off-road navigation. Performance is characterized
by analyzing the results of 30,000 planning and navigation trials in simulation
and validated through field testing. Our simulation campaign considers three
kinematically challenging terrain maps and twenty combinations of seven
path-planning parameters. In simulation, our MUONS-equipped AGV achieved a 0.98
success rate and experienced no failures in the field. By statistical and
correlation analysis we determined that the Bi-RRT expansion radius used in the
initial planning stages is most correlated with performance in terms of
planning time and traversed path length. Finally, we observed that the
proportional variation due to changes in the tuning parameters is remarkably
well correlated to performance in field testing. This finding supports the use
of Monte-Carlo simulation campaigns for performance assessment and parameter
tuning.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization in dense urban environments poses a fundamental
task in photogrammetry, geospatial information science, and robotics. While
imagery is a low-cost and widely accessible sensing modality, its effectiveness
on visual odometry is often limited by textureless surfaces, severe viewpoint
changes, and long-term drift. The growing public availability of airborne laser
scanning (ALS) data opens new avenues for scalable and precise visual
localization by leveraging ALS as a prior map. However, the potential of
ALS-based localization remains underexplored due to three key limitations: (1)
the lack of platform-diverse datasets, (2) the absence of reliable ground-truth
generation methods applicable to large-scale urban environments, and (3)
limited validation of existing Image-to-Point Cloud (I2P) algorithms under
aerial-ground cross-platform settings. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a new large-scale dataset that integrates ground-level imagery from
mobile mapping systems with ALS point clouds collected in Wuhan, Hong Kong, and
San Francisco.

Abstract: Traditional online Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods often suffer from
excessive computational complexity, limiting their practical deployment.
Explicit MPC mitigates online computational load by pre-computing control
policies offline; however, existing explicit MPC methods typically rely on
simplified system dynamics and cost functions, restricting their accuracy for
complex systems. This paper proposes TransMPC, a novel Transformer-based
explicit MPC algorithm capable of generating highly accurate control sequences
in real-time for complex dynamic systems. Specifically, we formulate the MPC
policy as an encoder-only Transformer leveraging bidirectional self-attention,
enabling simultaneous inference of entire control sequences in a single forward
pass. This design inherently accommodates variable prediction horizons while
ensuring low inference latency. Furthermore, we introduce a direct policy
optimization framework that alternates between sampling and learning phases.
Unlike imitation-based approaches dependent on precomputed optimal
trajectories, TransMPC directly optimizes the true finite-horizon cost via
automatic differentiation. Random horizon sampling combined with a replay
buffer provides independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training
samples, ensuring robust generalization across varying states and horizon
lengths. Extensive simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments
validate the effectiveness of TransMPC in terms of solution accuracy,
adaptability to varying horizons, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted great interest due to its potential
capability in full-unsupervised driving. Model-based and learning-based methods
are widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined
models of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal
policy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the
above limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However,
existing PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training
efficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are
equivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper
develops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a
risk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a
safety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting
areas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO.
The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding
vehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during
training. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold
channel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images.
Moreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions
with risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation
results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak
reward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky
areas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.

Abstract: Service robots have demonstrated significant potential for autonomous trolley
collection and redistribution in public spaces like airports or warehouses to
improve efficiency and reduce cost. Usually, a fully autonomous system for the
collection and transportation of multiple trolleys is based on a
Leader-Follower formation of mobile manipulators, where reliable docking
maneuvers of the mobile base are essential to align trolleys into organized
queues. However, developing a vision-based robotic docking system faces
significant challenges: high precision requirements, environmental
disturbances, and inherent robot constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose an optimization-based Visual Servoing scheme that incorporates active
infrared markers for robust feature extraction across diverse lighting
conditions. This framework explicitly models nonholonomic kinematics and
visibility constraints within the Hybrid Visual Servoing problem, augmented
with an observer for disturbance rejection to ensure precise and stable
docking. Experimental results across diverse environments demonstrate the
robustness of this system, with quantitative evaluations confirming high
docking accuracy.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究时间敏感场景下的语言协助系统，通过强化学习和计时模型平衡指令的及时性与信息量，提高了系统效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言协助系统过于关注内容生成而忽视了关键时间因素，如语言传达时长、人类理解延迟和执行时间，这在时间敏感的驾驶协助等场景中很重要。

Method: 使用增强状态马尔可夫决策过程建模，结合强化学习和生成的离线分类数据集，平衡及时性与信息量的交换。

Result: 通过综合人类模拟评估，该框架比忽视时间延迟的方法提高了超10%的成功率，同时有效平衡了及时性和信息量。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了协助系统中及时性与信息量的重要交换关系，为优化时间敏感场景中的人工智能沟通开启了新方向。

Abstract: In time-critical settings such as assistive driving, assistants often rely on
alerts or haptic signals to prompt rapid human attention, but these cues
usually leave humans to interpret situations and decide responses
independently, introducing potential delays or ambiguity in meaning.
Language-based assistive systems can instead provide instructions backed by
context, offering more informative guidance. However, current approaches (e.g.,
social assistive robots) largely prioritize content generation while
overlooking critical timing factors such as verbal conveyance duration, human
comprehension delays, and subsequent follow-through duration. These timing
considerations are crucial in time-critical settings, where even minor delays
can substantially affect outcomes. We aim to study this inherent trade-off
between timeliness and informativeness by framing the challenge as a sequential
decision-making problem using an augmented-state Markov Decision Process. We
design a framework combining reinforcement learning and a generated offline
taxonomy dataset, where we balance the trade-off while enabling a scalable
taxonomy dataset generation pipeline. Empirical evaluation with synthetic
humans shows our framework improves success rates by over 40% compared to
methods that ignore time delays, while effectively balancing timeliness and
informativeness. It also exposes an often-overlooked trade-off between these
two factors, opening new directions for optimizing communication in
time-critical human-AI assistance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing,
which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch,
bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand
object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and
palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70
environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy
transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot
hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered
baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on
reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These
results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time

Motivation: 解决机器人视觉输入退化或不足时的可靠操作问题，特别是在黑暗或运动模糊等传感器退化情况下。

Method: 使用条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)从LiDAR点云合成RGB图像，通过Luminance-Aware Modality Adaptation (LAMA)动态融合合成图像和真实RGB数据，基于环境光照条件进行自适应混合。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上的评估显示，该方法在低光条件下显著提升性能，相比仅使用RGB的基线有大幅改进，同时保持与冻结视觉语言模型的兼容性。

Conclusion: LiDAR引导的RGB合成方法具有在现实环境中实现鲁棒机器人操作的潜力，能够补偿传感器退化而无需微调下游模型。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要在动态不确定环境中平衡安全性和驾驶效率，但周围人类驾驶车辆的不可预测性和感知误差使得规划器必须适应不断演化的不确定性，同时保持安全轨迹。过于保守的规划器会降低驾驶效率，而确定性方法在面对突发意外操作时可能面临严重风险和失败。

Method: 采用事件触发的在线学习人类驾驶车辆控制意图集，动态量化多模态不确定性并逐步细化前向可达集。通过基于FRS的屏障约束强制执行不变安全性，这些约束嵌入在应急轨迹优化中，并通过共识交替方向乘子法高效求解。

Result: 在高速公路和城市场景的高保真仿真以及一系列真实世界实验中，该方法在保持不确定条件下安全性的同时，显著提高了驾驶效率和乘客舒适度。

Conclusion: 该框架能够持续适应人类驾驶车辆行为的不确定性，在不采取过度保守策略的情况下保持可行性和安全性，为自动驾驶在动态不确定环境中的安全高效导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while
balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by
the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and
perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving
uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners
degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter
serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected
maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency
trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered
online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies
multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS)
incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier
constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory
prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory
optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the
uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without
resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and
urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while
maintaining safety under uncertainty. The project page is available at

Abstract: Birds in nature perform perching not only for rest but also for interaction
with human such as the relationship with falconers. Recently, researchers
achieve perching-capable aerial robots as a way to save energy, and deformable
structure demonstrate significant advantages in efficiency of perching and
compactness of configuration. However, ensuring flight stability remains
challenging for deformable aerial robots due to the difficulty of controlling
flexible arms. Furthermore, perching for human interaction requires high
compliance along with safety. Thus, this study aims to develop a deformable
aerial robot capable of perching on humans with high flexibility and grasping
ability. To overcome the challenges of stability of both flight and perching,
we propose a hybrid morphing structure that combines a unilateral flexible arm
and a pneumatic inflatable actuators. This design allows the robot's arms to
remain rigid during flight and soft while perching for more effective grasping.
We also develop a pneumatic control system that optimizes pressure regulation
while integrating shock absorption and adjustable grasping forces, enhancing
interaction capabilities and energy efficiency. Besides, we focus on the
structural characteristics of the unilateral flexible arm and identify
sufficient conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling and control
remain effective in terms of flight stability. Finally, the developed prototype
demonstrates the feasibility of compliant perching maneuvers on humans, as well
as the robust recovery even after arm deformation caused by thrust reductions
during flight. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to achieve
an aerial robot capable of perching on humans for interaction.

Result: 在多样化场景中，在渲染保真度、几何精度和零样本语义分割方面优于最先进方法

Conclusion: OmniMap框架具有多功能性，支持多领域场景问答、交互式编辑、感知引导操作和地图辅助导航等下游应用

Abstract: Robotic systems demand accurate and comprehensive 3D environment perception,
requiring simultaneous capture of photo-realistic appearance (optical), precise
layout shape (geometric), and open-vocabulary scene understanding (semantic).
Existing methods typically achieve only partial fulfillment of these
requirements while exhibiting optical blurring, geometric irregularities, and
semantic ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMap. Overall,
OmniMap represents the first online mapping framework that simultaneously
captures optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes while maintaining
real-time performance and model compactness. At the architectural level,
OmniMap employs a tightly coupled 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation that
combines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation
level, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and
introduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and
exposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal
constraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding.
Extensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering
fidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is
further evidenced through a variety of downstream applications, including
multi-domain scene Q&A, interactive editing, perception-guided manipulation,
and map-assisted navigation.

Abstract: This manuscript investigates the integration of positional encoding -- a
technique widely used in computer graphics -- into the input vector of a binary
classification model for self-collision detection. The results demonstrate the
benefits of incorporating positional encoding, which enhances classification
accuracy by enabling the model to better capture high-frequency variations,
leading to a more detailed and precise representation of complex collision
patterns. The manuscript shows that machine learning-based techniques, such as
lightweight multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) operating in a low-dimensional

traditional methods that rely on geometric approaches, such as
triangle-to-triangle intersection tests and Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH)

Method: 使用SSD-Mamba2选择性状态空间骨干网络，融合本体感觉状态和外感观测，通过状态空间对偶实现循环和卷积扫描，硬件感知流式处理，近线性扩展

Result: 在多样化运动控制场景中，在回报率、安全性（碰撞和跌倒）和样本效率方面一致超越强基线方法，相同计算预算下收敛更快

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2为可扩展、有前瞻性和高效的端到端运动控制提供了实用的融合骨干网络

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

Abstract: In robots task and motion planning (TAMP), it is crucial to sample within the

traditional sampling and learning-based approaches reveal that RobKiNet's
kinematic knowledge infusion enhances training efficiency by ensuring stable
and accurate gradient optimization.Visualizations and quantitative analyses in
a 2-DOF space validate its theoretical efficiency, while its application on a

whole-body and decoupled control, excelling in battery disassembly tasks.
RobKiNet outperforms deep reinforcement learning with a training speed 74.29

Abstract: Efficient exploration of unknown environments is crucial for autonomous
robots, especially in confined and large-scale scenarios with limited
communication. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative
exploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages
the complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a
graph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial
robot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground
robot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground
platform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale
spatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven
map compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct
resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical
details, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing
key data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map
integration for collaborative path planning. Simulation and real-world
experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving exploration efficiency while significantly reducing data
transmission.

Conclusion: 该方法向更透明、可理解和可信赖的机器人系统进行了重要一步

Abstract: Explainability is a critical tool in helping stakeholders understand robots.
In particular, the ability for robots to explain why they have made a
particular decision or behaved in a certain way is useful in this regard.
Behaviour trees are a popular framework for controlling the decision-making of
robots and other software systems, and thus a natural question to ask is
whether or not a system driven by a behaviour tree is capable of answering
"why" questions. While explainability for behaviour trees has seen some prior
attention, no existing methods are capable of generating causal, counterfactual
explanations which detail the reasons for robot decisions and behaviour.
Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel approach which automatically
generates counterfactual explanations in response to contrastive "why"
questions. Our method achieves this by first automatically building a causal
model from the structure of the behaviour tree as well as domain knowledge
about the state and individual behaviour tree nodes. The resultant causal model
is then queried and searched to find a set of diverse counterfactual
explanations. We demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly explain the
behaviour of a wide range of behaviour tree structures and states. By being
able to answer a wide range of causal queries, our approach represents a step
towards more transparent, understandable and ultimately trustworthy robotic
systems.

Abstract: This study presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based control
framework aimed at enhancing the safety and robustness of the quadcopter, with
a specific focus on resilience to in-flight one propeller failure. Addressing
the critical need of a robust control strategy for maintaining a desired
altitude for the quadcopter to safe the hardware and the payload in physical
applications. The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic
Programming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the
challenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a
model-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high
computational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid
computation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge
arises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With
modifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were
trained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also
achieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the
robustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were
conducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and
underscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications. A
comparative analysis was performed between both RL algorithms and their
potential for applications in faulty aerial systems.

Conclusion: SPERO建立了可推广的停止旋翼无人机设计和控制框架，为这类理想VTOL飞行器的实用化奠定了基础

Abstract: Stop-rotor aircraft have long been proposed as the ideal vertical takeoff and
landing (VTOL) aircraft for missions with equal time spent in both flight
regimes, such as agricultural monitoring, search and rescue, and last-mile
delivery. Featuring a central lifting surface that rotates in VTOL to generate
vertical thrust and locks in forward flight to generate passive lift, the
stop-rotor offers the potential for high efficiency across both modes. However,
practical implementation has remained infeasible due to aerodynamic and
stability conflicts between flight modes. In this work, we present SPERO
(Stopped-Penta Rotor), a stop-rotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a
flipping and latching wing, an active center of pressure mechanism, thrust
vectored counterbalances, a five-rotor architecture, and an eleven-state
machine flight controller coordinating geometric and controller
reconfiguration. Furthermore, SPERO establishes a generalizable design and
control framework for stopped-rotor UAVs. Together, these innovations overcome
longstanding challenges in stop-rotor flight and enable the first stable,
bidirectional transition between VTOL and forward flight.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的可编程锁定单元(PLC)，通过机械互锁关节实现离散刚度调节，能够组装成可重构机器人结构，在适应抓取和受限环境导航等任务中表现出高刚度变化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人系统在非结构化环境中需要能够在柔顺和刚性状态之间切换，以执行适应抓取、高力操作、形状保持和受限空间导航等多样化任务。现有可变刚度解决方案存在复杂驱动方案、持续输入功率或整体式设计等问题，限制了模块化和可扩展性。

Method: 开发了模块化、肌腱驱动的可编程锁定单元(PLC)，通过电缆张力驱动的机械互锁关节实现离散刚度调节。每个单元通过结构啮合在柔顺和坚固状态之间转换，多个单元可组装成空间可编程刚度的可重构机器人结构。

Result: 每个单元实现高达950%的刚度变化，在坚固状态下高负载时不易损坏。通过两个功能原型验证：可变刚度夹爪（适应抓取、牢固保持和手中操作）和管道穿越机器人（在受限环境中实现形状适应性和刚度控制）。

Conclusion: PLC作为一种可扩展的、以结构为中心的机制，实现了可编程刚度和运动，使机器人系统具有可重构形态和任务自适应交互能力。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating in unstructured environments require the ability to
switch between compliant and rigid states to perform diverse tasks such as
adaptive grasping, high-force manipulation, shape holding, and navigation in
constrained spaces, among others. However, many existing variable stiffness
solutions rely on complex actuation schemes, continuous input power, or
monolithic designs, limiting their modularity and scalability. This paper
presents the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC)-a modular, tendon-driven unit that
achieves discrete stiffness modulation through mechanically interlocked joints
actuated by cable tension. Each unit transitions between compliant and firm
states via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high
stiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under
high payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into
reconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We
validate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness
gripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation;
and (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves
shape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These
results demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for
programmable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable
morphology and task-adaptive interaction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RaC是一种新的机器人模仿学习训练阶段，通过在人类干预的rollout数据上进行微调，让机器人学会恢复和纠正行为，显著提升了长时程任务的效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于人类遥操作的专家数据收集方法效率低下，导致接触丰富、可变形物体和长时程任务的性能远低于完美执行水平，即使有数千条专家演示数据。

Method: 在模仿学习预训练后，引入RaC阶段：在策略rollout过程中，当失败即将发生时，人类操作员进行干预，先将机器人回退到熟悉的状态，然后提供纠正片段来完成当前子任务，并在此类干预轨迹上微调策略。

Result: 在三个真实世界双手机器人控制任务（衬衫悬挂、密封容器盖、外卖盒打包）和一个模拟装配任务中，RaC使用10倍少的数据收集时间和样本，超越了先前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: RaC通过训练恢复和适应行为扩展了机器人技能库，实现了测试时性能扩展：训练后的RaC策略性能与其展示的恢复操作数量呈线性比例关系。

Abstract: Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on
large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich,
deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,
even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency
of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.
To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on
human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we
fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate
recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human
operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot
back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective
segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition
expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,
which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on
long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt
hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated
assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less
data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time
scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the
number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are
available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于轨迹复制的方法在泛化到不同物体、空间布局和机械臂配置时存在困难，需要一种能够进行任务级推理和执行的方法。

Method: 使用信息论方法提取手-物体和物体-物体交互的关键线索，构建时序场景图，结合语言条件transformer生成层次行为树和笛卡尔运动基元，提出跨臂分配策略。

Result: 在四个双手机器人积木装配基准测试中，图准确率超过95%，子任务分割准确率93%，抓取可靠性94%，放置精度89%，整体任务成功率90%。

Conclusion: GF-VLA框架能够从RGB-D人类演示中提取有效的任务表示，生成鲁棒且可解释的任务策略，在多样化的空间和语义变化下表现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a
significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level
trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects,
spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we
introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that
enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution
directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an
information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively
highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues
are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently
integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance
efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy
that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit
geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly
benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial
generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation
achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the
language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When
deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89%
placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking,
letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong
generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.

TL;DR: 提出了扭矩感知的VLA模型，通过在解码器中引入扭矩适配器和预测扭矩作为辅助输出，显著提升了机器人在接触丰富操作任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型缺乏整合力反馈信号(如扭矩)的能力，无法感知和响应物理交互中的细微力信号，限制了在需要力感知的机器人操作任务中的表现。

Method: 系统研究了将扭矩信号集成到VLA架构中的设计空间，重点探索了在解码器中引入扭矩适配器的方法，并借鉴自动驾驶中的联合预测和规划范式，提出了预测扭矩作为辅助输出的策略。

Result: 实验表明，在解码器中引入扭矩适配器的方法始终优于在编码器中插入的方法；预测扭矩作为辅助输出进一步提升了性能，帮助模型建立物理交互动态的接地内部表示。

Conclusion: 通过在VLA模型中有效整合扭矩信号，显著提升了机器人在接触丰富操作任务中的感知和控制能力，为力感知机器人操作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force
signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully
completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle
physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to
bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating
torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate
several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque
adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the
encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in
autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which
further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a
physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation
benchmarks validate our findings.

*Yanlin Zhou,Manshi Limbu,Xuesu Xiao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出了团队在具有风险边的图上协调问题(TCGRE)，通过代理之间的主动协作来降低高风险边的遍历成本，并证明了该问题的NP难性。研究提出了多种高效分解算法，包括动态联合状态图方法，在保持最优性的同时大幅提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中多代琇体需要主动协作来提升团队性能，而不仅仅是避免碰撞。传统的多代琇路径规划(MAPF)法无法满足这种主动协作需求，因此需要新的理论框架来解决具有风险边的团队协调问题。

Method: 将TCGRE问题重新形式化为3D匹配问题，并通过从最小3D匹配问题的归约严格证明其NP难性。提出了三种分解方法：联合状态图(JSG)、协调尽穿搜索(CES)、重新平移乐观合作A*(RHOCA*)。进一步提出动态图构建方法(Dynamic-HJSG)，利用代理体同质性来剪析冗余状态和降低计算复杂度。

Result: 理论分析表明Dynamic-HJSG方法在保持最优性的同时，将复杂度从指数级降低到多项式级。实验结果验证了方法在大规模团队和图形上的可扩展性，HJSG在不同规模和类型图形上的运行时间远超基线方法。

Conclusion: 本研究桥接了组合优化和多代琇体规划领域，为协作式路径规划提供了一个有理论基础的框架，具有可证明的性能保证。该解决方案的核心思想可以广泛扩展到其他协作优化问题，如多代琇路径规划(MAPF)等。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance,
but many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to
improve team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs
with Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on
high-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D
matching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and
rigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To
address this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient
decomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems:
Joint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path
problem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments
via exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*):
Balances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in
this extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method
(Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and
reduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph
dynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while
lowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical
results validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG
outperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of
graphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning,
offering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable
guarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many
other collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.

Conclusion: 基于进化博弈论的因果评估框架为自动驾驶车辆交互提供了有效的去中心化自适应解决方案，在多种场景下表现出优越性能

Abstract: Modern transportation systems face significant challenges in ensuring road
safety, given serious injuries caused by road accidents. The rapid growth of
autonomous vehicles (AVs) has prompted new traffic designs that aim to optimize
interactions among AVs. However, effective interactions between AVs remains
challenging due to the absence of centralized control. Besides, there is a need
for balancing multiple factors, including passenger demands and overall traffic
efficiency. Traditional rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic
approaches each have limitations in addressing these challenges. Rule-based
methods struggle with adaptability and generalization in complex scenarios,
while optimization-based methods often require high computational resources.
Game-theoretic approaches, such as Stackelberg and Nash games, suffer from
limited adaptability and potential inefficiencies in cooperative settings. This
paper proposes an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)-based framework for AV
interactions that overcomes these limitations by utilizing a decentralized and
adaptive strategy evolution mechanism. A causal evaluation module (CEGT) is
introduced to optimize the evolutionary rate, balancing mutation and evolution
by learning from historical interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the
proposed CEGT outperforms EGT and popular benchmark games in terms of lower
collision rates, improved safety distances, higher speeds, and overall better
performance compared to Nash and Stackelberg games across diverse scenarios and
parameter settings.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了最小化机器群的协调问题，比较了直接切换和交叉抗抗两种意见动态机制，发现在存在偏见的情况下，生物受启发的交叉抗抗机制能够做出更快速、更准确、更稳健的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最小化机器群虽然具有可扩展性、稳健性和成本效益优势，但在通信、计算和存储受限的情况下，协调这种去中心化系统仍然是根本挑战。研究者想要探索如何在个体感知经常出错的情况下，让群体仍能快速可靠地对多个选项达成共识。

Method: 研究比较了两种典型的意见动态机制：直接切换和交叉抗抗。通过展现存在的平均场模型，考虑了影响意见动态的非社会偏见。在存在偏见的各种条件下测试了这两种机制的性能。

Result: 使用直接切换机制的机器群在没有偏见的情况下能可靠选择最佳选项，但一旦引入偏见就会出现性能下降，常常导致决策死锁。相比之下，受生物学启发的交叉抗抗机制能够在广泛的偏见条件下做出更快速、更团结、更准确、更稳健和更可扩展的决策。

Conclusion: 研究结果为最小化机器群的协调提供了理论和实践见解，这些发现也扩展到生物学和工程领域中广泛的去中心化决策系统。交叉抗抗机制在应对实际应用中常见的偏见问题时显示出优越性能。

Abstract: Minimalistic robot swarms offer a scalable, robust, and cost-effective
approach to performing complex tasks with the potential to transform
applications in healthcare, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.
However, coordinating such decentralised systems remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly when robots are constrained in communication,
computation, and memory. In our study, individual robots frequently make errors
when sensing the environment, yet the swarm can rapidly and reliably reach
consensus on the best among $n$ discrete options. We compare two canonical
mechanisms of opinion dynamics -- direct-switch and cross-inhibition -- which
are simple yet effective rules for collective information processing observed
in biological systems across scales, from neural populations to insect
colonies. We generalise the existing mean-field models by considering asocial
biases influencing the opinion dynamics. While swarms using direct-switch
reliably select the best option in absence of asocial dynamics, their
performance deteriorates once such biases are introduced, often resulting in
decision deadlocks. In contrast, bio-inspired cross-inhibition enables faster,
more cohesive, accurate, robust, and scalable decisions across a wide range of
biased conditions. Our findings provide theoretical and practical insights into
the coordination of minimal swarms and offer insights that extend to a broad
class of decentralised decision-making systems in biology and engineering.

Conclusion: MoMA框架成功解决了多样化查询的路由问题，通过混合模型和代理的方法实现了效率与成本的最佳平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI
agents has greatly expanded the ecosystem of AI-powered services. User queries,
however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types,
resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a
fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an
appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To
address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized
routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon
a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles
diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing
strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost.
Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the
capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures,
identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are
dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We
also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware
state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to
existing approaches.

Abstract: Gaze prediction is a diverse field of study with multiple research focuses
and practical applications. This article investigates how recurrent neural
networks and transformers perform short-term gaze prediction. We used three
models: a three-layer long-short-term memory (LSTM) network, a simple
transformer-encoder model (TF), and a classification-predictor network (ClPr),
which simultaneously classifies the signal into eye movement events and
predicts the positions of gaze. The performance of the models was evaluated for
ocular fixations and saccades of various amplitudes and as a function of
individual differences in both typical and extreme cases. On average, LSTM
performed better on fixations and saccades, whereas TF and ClPr demonstrated
more precise results for post-saccadic periods. In extreme cases, the
best-performing models vary depending on the type of eye movement. We reviewed
the difference between the median $P_{50}$ and high-percentile $P_{95}$ error
profiles across subjects. The subjects for which the models perform the best
overall do not necessarily exhibit the lowest $P_{95}$ values, which supports
the idea of analyzing extreme cases separately in future work. We explore the
trade-offs between the proposed solutions and provide practical insights into
model selection for gaze prediction.

Abstract: Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with
the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Electroencephalography
(EEG)-based text production is still difficult, though, because it requires a
lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that
combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to
incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically
lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance
close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current
methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of
10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective
transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and
functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential
of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and
improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations.
Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for
research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the
strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production

Result: 版主使用modqueue的方式差异很大：有人将其作为日常检查清单，有人用作推断社区模式的中心，许多人认为队列不足以支持审核决策。识别出审核协调、界面信号不一致、依赖第三方工具等持续挑战

Conclusion: modqueue不是万能解决方案，单独使用时不足以支持版主审核工作。研究强调了设计更模块化、集成化和可定制化平台基础设施的机会，以更好地支持多样化版主工作流

Abstract: On Reddit, the moderation queue (modqueue) is a primary interface for
moderators to review reported content. Despite its central role in Reddit's
community-reliant moderation model, little is known about how moderators
actually use it in practice. To address this gap, we surveyed 110 moderators,
who collectively oversee more than 400 unique subreddits, and asked them about
their usage of the modqueue. Modqueue practices vary widely: some moderators
approach it as a daily checklist, others as a hub to infer community-wide
patterns, and many still find the queue insufficient to inform their moderation
decisions. We also identify persistent challenges around review coordination,
inconsistent interface signals, and reliance on third-party tools. Taken
together, we show the modqueue is neither a one-size-fits-all solution nor
sufficient on its own for supporting moderator review. Our work highlights
design opportunities for more modular, integrated, and customizable platform
infrastructures that better support the diversity of moderator workflows.

### [110] [SpecifyUI: Supporting Iterative UI Design Intent Expression through Structured Specifications and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07334)
*Yunnong Chen,Chengwei Shi,Liuqing Chen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: SPEC是一个结构化、参数化的中间表示方法，将UI元素作为可控参数，SpecifyUI系统基于SPEC实现从参考UI提取、多源组合和精确编辑，显著提升了AI辅助设计的意图对齐和控制能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM工具在UI设计中难以准确表达设计师意图和控制迭代变化，需要一种更好的方法来连接设计意图和可控生成

Method: 提出SPEC中间表示方法，开发SpecifyUI系统，通过区域分割和视觉语言模型提取SPEC，支持多级编辑，使用多智能体生成器渲染高保真设计

Result: 定量实验显示基于SPEC的生成比基于提示的方法更准确地捕捉参考意图；用户研究显示SpecifyUI在意图对齐、设计质量、可控性和整体体验方面显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: SPEC代表了从一次性提示向迭代协作工作流的范式转变，为LLM辅助设计提供了规范驱动的新方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate UI design, yet current
tools struggle with two fundamentals: externalizing designers' intent and
controlling iterative change. We introduce SPEC, a structured, parameterized,
hierarchical intermediate representation that exposes UI elements as
controllable parameters. Building on SPEC, we present SpecifyUI, an interactive
system that extracts SPEC from UI references via region segmentation and
vision-language models, composes UIs across multiple sources, and supports
targeted edits at global, regional, and component levels. A multi-agent
generator renders SPEC into high-fidelity designs, closing the loop between
intent expression and controllable generation. Quantitative experiments show
SPEC-based generation more faithfully captures reference intent than
prompt-based baselines. In a user study with 16 professional designers,
SpecifyUI significantly outperformed Stitch on intent alignment, design
quality, controllability, and overall experience in human-AI co-creation. Our
results position SPEC as a specification-driven paradigm that shifts
LLM-assisted design from one-shot prompting to iterative, collaborative
workflows.

*Hyunseung Lim,Dasom Choi,DaEun Choi,Sooyohn Nam,Hwajung Hong*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Feed-O-Meter是一个基于LLM的AI系统，通过角色扮演让学生练习设计反馈，解决了设计课程中反馈技能培养的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计课程中学生因缺乏自信和害怕被评判而难以提供有效反馈，限制了反馈技能的发展。虽然LLM角色扮演可以缓解焦虑，但现有方法难以真实模拟人类行为

Method: 开发Feed-O-Meter系统，使用精心设计的LLM智能体创建反馈练习环境。学生扮演导师角色，向AI学员提供反馈，并观察反馈对AI学员创意发展的影响

Result: 用户研究(N=24)显示，系统通过角色切换提高了参与者的参与度和动机，帮助他们调整反馈使其对AI学员更易理解

Conclusion: Feed-O-Meter有效支持设计教育中的反馈技能培养，为未来设计教育系统的开发提供了方向

Abstract: Effective feedback, including critique and evaluation, helps designers
develop design concepts and refine their ideas, supporting informed
decision-making throughout the iterative design process. However, in
studio-based design courses, students often struggle to provide feedback due to
a lack of confidence and fear of being judged, which limits their ability to
develop essential feedback-giving skills. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) suggest that role-playing with AI agents can let learners engage
in multi-turn feedback without the anxiety of external judgment or the time
constraints of real-world settings. Yet prior studies have raised concerns that
LLMs struggle to behave like real people in role-play scenarios, diminishing
the educational benefits of these interactions. Therefore, designing AI-based
agents that effectively support learners in practicing and developing
intellectual reasoning skills requires more than merely assigning the target
persona's personality and role to the agent. By addressing these issues, we
present Feed-O-Meter, a novel system that employs carefully designed LLM-based
agents to create an environment in which students can practice giving design
feedback. The system enables users to role-play as mentors, providing feedback
to an AI mentee and allowing them to reflect on how that feedback impacts the
AI mentee's idea development process. A user study (N=24) indicated that
Feed-O-Meter increased participants' engagement and motivation through
role-switching and helped them adjust feedback to be more comprehensible for an
AI mentee. Based on these findings, we discuss future directions for designing
systems to foster feedback skills in design education.

Motivation: 随着交互式网络地理可视化在各学科中日益重要，需要开源框架来支持动态、多属性的空间分析和易用设计。

Method: 扩展原有的dciWebMapper框架，集成多种地图类型（等值区域图、比例符号图、小多图、热力图）和链接统计图表（散点图、箱线图），采用协调视图环境和下拉菜单控制。

Result: 开发出完全开源、自包含、无需服务器的框架，支持模块化、可重复性和长期可持续性，通过三个应用案例展示了其适应性和潜力。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究、教育和公民参与提供了包容性空间叙事和透明地理空间分析的通用基础，有助于民主化交互式网络制图。

Abstract: As interactive web-based geovisualization becomes increasingly vital across
disciplines, there is a growing need for open-source frameworks that support
dynamic, multi-attribute spatial analysis and accessible design. This paper
introduces dciWebMapper2, a significant expansion of the original dciWebMapper
framework, designed to enable exploratory analysis across domains such as
climate justice, food access, and social vulnerability. The enhanced framework
integrates multiple map types, including choropleth, proportional symbol, small
multiples, and heatmaps, with linked statistical charts (e.g., scatter plots,
boxplots) and time sliders, all within a coordinated-view environment.
Dropdown-based controls allow flexible, high-dimensional comparisons while
maintaining visual clarity. Grounded in cartographic and information
visualization principles, dciWebMapper2 is fully open-source, self-contained,
and server-free, supporting modularity, reproducibility, and long-term
sustainability. Three applied use cases demonstrate its adaptability and
potential to democratize interactive web cartography. This work offers a
versatile foundation for inclusive spatial storytelling and transparent
geospatial analysis in research, education, and civic engagement.

TL;DR: 社交媒体克隆体是AI驱动的个人社交代理，虽然能提供便利和舒适，但也会威胁用户真实性并增加在线社区的怀疑，导致用户行为更接近克隆体以避免差异和互动中断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着身份和在线角色的交织，社交媒体克隆技术有潜力极大增强社交媒体体验，但如果管理不当，也可能对社交声誉和在线关系构成新风险。需要了解社交媒体克隆体如何影响在线行为和互动。

Method: 通过对32名社交媒体用户进行半结构化访谈，引入8个推测性克隆概念的设计工作簿，应用AI中介通信的现有工作在社交媒体背景下进行分析。

Result: 研究发现克隆体虽然能提供便利和舒适，但也会威胁用户真实性并增加在线社区的怀疑，导致用户行为更接近克隆体以避免差异和互动中断。

Conclusion: 通过身份和印象管理的现有文献视角讨论这些发现，强调社交媒体克隆体被公众采纳的挑战，并为其成功整合到社交媒体平台提出设计考虑。

Abstract: Social media clones are AI-powered social delegates of ourselves created
using our personal data. As our identities and online personas intertwine,
these technologies have the potential to greatly enhance our social media
experience. If mismanaged, however, these clones may also pose new risks to our
social reputation and online relationships. To set the foundation for a
productive and responsible integration, we set out to understand how social
media clones will impact our online behavior and interactions. We conducted a
series of semi-structured interviews introducing eight speculative clone
concepts to 32 social media users through a design workbook. Applying existing
work in AI-mediated communication in the context of social media, we found that
although clones can offer convenience and comfort, they can also threaten the
user's authenticity and increase skepticism within the online community. As a
result, users tend to behave more like their clones to mitigate discrepancies
and interaction breakdowns. These findings are discussed through the lens of
past literature in identity and impression management to highlight challenges
in the adoption of social media clones by the general public, and propose
design considerations for their successful integration into social media
platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估扩展现实(XR)旅游中数字双生应用的用户体验，比较AR和VR两种不同方案在用户体验、任务负荷、伴随感等方面的差异，为XR旅游应用的设计提供指导。

Method: 采用定量探索研究方法，对84名来自西班牙和德国的参与者分成三个样本组，通过标准化问卷评估用户体验、任务负荷、伴随感、虚拟疼疼和情感响应。

Result: 两种应用都提供了低任务负荷和高娱乐性。VR导游提升了伴随感但存在可用性和虚拟疼疼挑战；AR导游获得了高用户体验评分。相关分析显示年龄、先前XR经验和技术亲和力与测量指标存在显著关联。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了为XR新手设计优秀体验的重要性，并强化了用户体验在数字双生基础的XR旅游中的关键作用。

Abstract: This study evaluates the user experience (UX) in extended reality (XR)
tourism of two digital twin-based applications: an Augmented Reality Virtual
Tour (AR-VT) for enhanced on-site visits and a Virtual Reality Virtual Tour
(VR-VT) for remote exploration. Using a quantitative exploratory approach, 84
participants from Spain and Germany, divided into three sample groups, assessed
UX, task load, presence, cybersickness, and emotional response through
standardized questionnaires. Findings indicate that both applications provided
a low task load and high enjoyment. The VR-based tour enhanced presence but
posed usability and cybersickness challenges, while the AR-based tour achieved
high UX ratings, with qualitative feedback suggesting areas for refinement.
Correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between age, prior XR
experience, and technological affinity with the measured metrics for both
applications. These results highlight the importance of well-designed
experiences tailored to XR novices, reinforcing the critical role of UX in
digital twin-based XR tourism.

Abstract: In modern online learning, understanding and predicting student behavior is
crucial for enhancing engagement and optimizing educational outcomes. This
systematic review explores the integration of biosensors and Multimodal
Learning Analytics (MmLA) to analyze and predict student behavior during
computer-based learning sessions. We examine key challenges, including emotion
and attention detection, behavioral analysis, experimental design, and
demographic considerations in data collection. Our study highlights the growing
role of physiological signals, such as heart rate, brain activity, and
eye-tracking, combined with traditional interaction data and self-reports to
gain deeper insights into cognitive states and engagement levels. We synthesize
findings from 54 key studies, analyzing commonly used methodologies such as
advanced machine learning algorithms and multimodal data pre-processing
techniques. The review identifies current research trends, limitations, and
emerging directions in the field, emphasizing the transformative potential of
biosensor-driven adaptive learning systems. Our findings suggest that
integrating multimodal data can facilitate personalized learning experiences,
real-time feedback, and intelligent educational interventions, ultimately
advancing toward a more customized and adaptive online learning experience.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型在维基百科社区中的使用情况，分析了不同经验水平的编辑如何利用LLM、如何使输出符合社区规范，以及社区对其他编辑LLM辅助贡献的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在知识生产社区中的广泛应用，需要理解它们如何影响社区参与和社会互动过程，但目前缺乏具体的规范指导。

Method: 通过对16位使用过LLM进行编辑的维基百科编辑进行访谈研究。

Result: 发现LLM对不同经验水平的编辑影响不同；使LLM输出符合社区规范需要隐性知识，这对新手构成挑战；社区对LLM辅助编辑的响应取决于编辑的专业水平。

Conclusion: 挑战了现有的新人参与模式，提出了支持社区参与的LLM设计建议，包括脚手架、教学和情境感知功能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping knowledge production as community
members increasingly incorporate them into their contribution workflows.
However, participating in knowledge communities involves more than just
contributing content - it is also a deeply social process. While communities
must carefully consider appropriate and responsible LLM integration, the
absence of concrete norms has left individual editors to experiment and
navigate LLM use on their own. Understanding how LLMs influence community
participation is therefore critical in shaping future norms and supporting
effective adoption. To address this gap, we investigated Wikipedia, one of the
largest knowledge production communities, to understand 1) how LLMs influence
the ways editors contribute content, 2) what strategies editors leverage to
align LLM outputs with community norms, and 3) how other editors in the
community respond to LLM-assisted contributions. Through interviews with 16
Wikipedia editors who had used LLMs for their edits, we found that 1) LLMs
affected the content contributions for experienced and new editors differently;
2) aligning LLM outputs with community norms required tacit knowledge that
often challenged newcomers; and 3) as a result, other editors responded to
LLM-assisted edits differently depending on the editors' expertise level. Based
on these findings, we challenge existing models of newcomer involvement and
propose design implications for LLMs that support community engagement through
scaffolding, teaching, and context awareness.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: NeuroGaze是一个结合脑电图(EEG)和眼动追踪的混合接口，用于VR中的免手交互，在准确性方面表现更好但速度较慢，展示了消费级BCI在日常VR应用中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BCI主要在临床和实验室环境中研究，而消费级设备的兴起使得探索其在日常活动中的应用成为可能。VR领域现有输入方法往往需要在速度、准确性和体力消耗之间进行权衡。

Method: 研究引入NeuroGaze混合接口，结合EEG和眼动追踪技术。20名参与者使用三种输入方法（VR控制器、凝视+捏合手势、NeuroGaze）完成360度立方体选择任务，通过任务完成时间、错误率和NASA-TLX工作量指数进行评估。

Result: NeuroGaze使用现成硬件成功支持目标选择，相比其他方法产生更少的错误但需要更长的完成时间，体现了典型的速度-准确性权衡。工作量分析显示NeuroGaze比控制器减少了体力需求，但总体评分和用户偏好存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究证明了EEG+凝视混合系统在日常VR使用中的可行性，突出了其人体工程学优势和包容性潜力。虽然速度尚未具有竞争力，但NeuroGaze为消费级BCI在可访问性和长时间应用中的实际作用指明了方向，并强调了改进EEG信号处理和自适应多模态整合的必要性。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have traditionally been studied in clinical
and laboratory contexts, but the rise of consumer-grade devices now allows
exploration of their use in daily activities. Virtual reality (VR) provides a
particularly relevant domain, where existing input methods often force
trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and physical effort. This study introduces
NeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye
tracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR. Twenty participants
completed a 360{\deg} cube-selection task using three different input methods:
VR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance
was measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was
evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). NeuroGaze successfully
supported target selection with off-the-shelf hardware, producing fewer errors
than the alternative methods but requiring longer completion times, reflecting
a classic speed-accuracy tradeoff. Workload analysis indicated reduced physical
demand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user
preferences were mixed. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of hybrid
EEG+gaze systems for everyday VR use, highlighting their ergonomic benefits and
inclusivity potential. Although not yet competitive in speed, NeuroGaze points
toward a practical role for consumer-grade BCIs in accessibility and
long-duration applications, and underscores the need for improved EEG signal
processing and adaptive multimodal integration to enhance future performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于具身认知理论的"代理感"(FoA)新框架，替代传统的"感知代理"(SoA)概念，通过情感参与和意志注意两个子构念来量化人类自主性，为XR、BCI和AI交互设计提供神经现象学指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着XR、AI和BCI技术的发展，需要新的理论框架来理解人机交互中的人类自主性和代理能力，克服传统比较器模型的局限性。

Method: 借鉴具身认知理论，将人类概念化为自组织的操作封闭系统，提出"代理感"(FoA)概念及其两个子构念：情感参与和意志注意，通过神经动力学指标(效价、唤醒度、背侧注意系统的跨频率耦合)和第一人称现象学报告进行操作化。

Result: 开发了可测量的神经现象学指标，为数字可供性设计提供更丰富、更可操作的见解，特别是在XR、BCI、人机AI交互和生成式AI环境中。

Conclusion: 该框架旨在为快速发展的交互领域提供设计参数，显著增强人类代理能力，为XR、BCI和AI环境的设计提供新的概念路径和方法论支持。

Abstract: Emerging paradigms in XR, AI, and BCI contexts necessitate novel theoretical
frameworks for understanding human autonomy and agency in HCI. Drawing from
enactivist theories of cognition, we conceptualize human agents as
self-organizing, operationally closed systems that actively enact their
cognitive domains through dynamic interaction with their environments. To
develop measurable variables aligned with this framework, we introduce
"feelings of agency" (FoA) as an alternative to the established construct of
"sense of agency" (SoA), refining Synofzyk's multifactorial weighting model and
offering a novel conceptual pathway for overcoming gaps in the dominant
comparator model. We define FoA as comprising two subconstructs: affective
engagement and volitional attention, which we operationalize through integrated
neurodynamic indicators (valence, arousal, cross frequency coupling within the
dorsal attention system) and first-person phenomenological reports. We argue
that these neurophenomenological indicators provide richer, more actionable
insights for digital affordance design, particularly in XR, BCI, Human AI
Interaction (HAX), and generative AI environments. Our framework aims to inform
and inspire design parameters that significantly enhance human agency in
rapidly evolving interactive domains.

Motivation: 随着社交机器人深度融入日常生活，需要它们能够进行有意义的对话并展示社会情感智能的倾听行为，以增强沟通能力、促进自我表露、提供共情感和建立良好人际关系

Method: 开发LLM驱动的社交机器人，具备情境适当的情感化反馈和主动倾听功能，通过65名参与者的实验研究，比较了三种条件：主动倾听+反馈、仅反馈、无倾听行为（控制组）

Result: 与主动倾听机器人互动的参与者感知到更积极的互动体验，表现出最高的自我表露程度，并报告最强的被倾听感

Conclusion: 在社交机器人中实施主动倾听行为有潜力改善人机沟通，并有助于建立更深层次的人机关系和融洽关系

Abstract: As social robots get more deeply integrated intoour everyday lives, they will
be expected to engage in meaningful conversations and exhibit socio-emotionally
intelligent listening behaviors when interacting with people. Active listening
and backchanneling could be one way to enhance robots' communicative
capabilities and enhance their effectiveness in eliciting deeper
self-disclosure, providing a sense of empathy,and forming positive rapport and
relationships with people.Thus, we developed an LLM-powered social robot that
can exhibit contextually appropriate sentiment-based backchannelingand active
listening behaviors (active listening+backchanneling) and compared its efficacy
in eliciting people's self-disclosurein comparison to robots that do not
exhibit any of these listening behaviors (control) and a robot that only
exhibitsbackchanneling behavior (backchanneling-only). Through ourexperimental
study with sixty-five participants, we found theparticipants who conversed with
the active listening robot per-ceived the interactions more positively, in
which they exhibited the highest self-disclosures, and reported the strongest
senseof being listened to. The results of our study suggest that the
implementation of active listening behaviors in social robotshas the potential
to improve human-robot communication andcould further contribute to the
building of deeper human-robot relationships and rapport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人越来越多地模仿人类社交行为来促进互动，这些技术会激活人们固有的社交本能，引发情感反应，使用户将机器人视为真正具有生命般的过程，这带来了重要的伦理问题。

Method: 通过法律原则和伦理学的视角，分析社交机器人如何以新颖方式影响用户行为，并探讨在这些情况下用户是否能够获得适当信息来同意这些增强的互动。比较人类-机器人互动与熟悉互动环境的差异，并将知情同意的法律原则应用于社交机器人。

Result: 研究重新概念化了当前围绕该领域的伦理辩论，并综合提出了机器人开发者实现更道德和知情的人类-机器人互动的设计目标。

Conclusion: 社交机器人的设计需要特别关注知情同意原则，开发者应该制定明确的伦理设计目标，确保用户在与机器人互动时能够做出充分知情的决定，从而建立更加道德和透明的人机互动关系。

Abstract: Contemporary robots are increasingly mimicking human social behaviours to
facilitate interaction, such as smiling to signal approachability, or
hesitating before taking an action to allow people time to react. Such
techniques can activate a person's entrenched social instincts, triggering
emotional responses as though they are interacting with a fellow human, and can
prompt them to treat a robot as if it truly possesses the underlying life-like
processes it outwardly presents, raising significant ethical questions. We
engage these issues through the lens of informed consent: drawing upon
prevailing legal principles and ethics, we examine how social robots can
influence user behaviour in novel ways, and whether under those circumstances
users can be appropriately informed to consent to these heightened
interactions. We explore the complex circumstances of human-robot interaction
and highlight how it differs from more familiar interaction contexts, and we
apply legal principles relating to informed consent to social robots in order
to reconceptualize the current ethical debates surrounding the field. From this
investigation, we synthesize design goals for robot developers to achieve more
ethical and informed human-robot interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有意见形成模型主要关注同伴压力，但实际中意见形成还基于世界状态信息和说服努力。本文旨在研究在FJ模型中如何通过贝叶斯说服来影响意见均衡。

Method: 在FJ模型中引入贝叶斯说服框架：存在未知世界状态影响代理人预设立场，发送者可以部分揭示信息，代理人更新预设立场后形成意见均衡。提出了优化各种发送者目标的算法。

Result: 对于许多自然目标，存在简单最优策略；对于基于范围的目标，在常数秩或多项式范围组合情况下提供高效算法；一般情况给出n-近似和NP-hardness结果。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服在意见形成模型中具有重要作用，本文提供了系统性的算法框架和复杂性分析，为理解信息揭示对意见均衡的影响提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Prominent opinion formation models such as the one by Friedkin and Johnsen
(FJ) concentrate on the effects of peer pressure on public opinions. In
practice, opinion formation is also based on information about the state of the
world and persuasion efforts. In this paper, we analyze an approach of Bayesian
persuasion in the FJ model. There is an unknown state of the world that
influences the preconceptions of n agents. A sender S can (partially) reveal
information about the state to all agents. The agents update their
preconceptions, and an equilibrium of public opinions emerges. We propose
algorithms for the sender to reveal information in order to optimize various
aspects of the emerging equilibrium. For many natural sender objectives, we
show that there are simple optimal strategies. We then focus on a general class
of range-based objectives with desired opinion ranges for each agent. We
provide efficient algorithms in several cases, e.g., when the matrix of
preconceptions in all states has constant rank, or when there is only a
polynomial number of range combinations that lead to positive value for S. This
generalizes, e.g., instances with a constant number of states and/or agents, or
instances with a logarithmic number of ranges. In general, we show that
subadditive range-based objectives allow a simple n-approximation, and even for
additive ones, obtaining an $n^{1-c}$-approximation is NP-hard, for any
constant $c > 0$.

practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact
information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only
select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring
equal selection probability for constituents ex ante.
  We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the
number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time
algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for
a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go
beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more
interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post
monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we
explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical
algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear
programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent
distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to
deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解智能体的公平性在社会互动中至关重要，但缺乏直接观察偏好的方法。研究旨在通过行为演示推断智能体如何评价他人福利，解决公平性推断的挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体逆强化学习框架，构建贝叶斯策略来推理演示的最优性和一般和马尔可夫博弈中的均衡特征。通过在随机环境和协作烹饪任务中的实验验证方法。

Result: 实验表明可以从演示中可靠地推断出连贯的公平性概念。通过将智能体置于不同群体中，能够揭示其奖励结构的新方面，消除歧义以准确判断公平性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对智能体公平性偏好的解耦理解，为回答"谁在公平行事"这一核心问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: From altruism to antagonism, fairness plays a central role in social
interactions. But can we truly understand how fair someone is, especially
without explicit knowledge of their preferences? We cast this challenge as a
multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning problem, explicitly structuring
rewards to reflect how agents value the welfare of others. We introduce novel
Bayesian strategies, reasoning about the optimality of demonstrations and
characterisation of equilibria in general-sum Markov games. Our experiments,
spanning randomised environments and a collaborative cooking task, reveal that
coherent notions of fairness can be reliably inferred from demonstrations.
Furthermore, when isolating fairness components, we obtain a disentangled
understanding of agents preferences. Crucially, we unveil that by placing
agents in different groups, we can force them to exhibit new facets of their
reward structures, cutting through ambiguity to answer the central question:
who is being fair?

Abstract: We present a budget pacing feature called Smart Fast Finish (SFF). SFF builds
upon the industry standard Fast Finish (FF) feature in budget pacing systems
that depletes remaining advertising budget as quickly as possible towards the

experimentation data and offline simulations that SFF is a robust solution for
overdelivery mitigation when pacing budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种可解释的两阶段适配性空间-时间模型，用于预测睡眠质量。模型结合多尺度卷积、递归层、注意力机制和域适配策略，在5种输入和预测窗口大小下都超过了基准方法，最佳RMSE为0.216。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠质量对健康致关重要，需要可靠的预测工具进行预防性干预。但现有方法在个人化预测和适配性方面有限。

Method: 提出两阶段适配性空间-时间模型：1）多尺度卷积层模型多变量空间相互作用；2）递归层和注意力机制捕捉长期时间依赖；3）两阶段域适配（训练阶段减少过拟合，测试阶段无源适配新用户）。

Result: 在5种输入窗口（3-11天）和5种预测窗口（1-9天）下均超过LSTM、Informer、PatchTST、TimesNet等基准方法。最佳绩效（3天输入+1天预测）RMSE=0.216，甚至9天预测窗口下RMSE仍为0.257。可解释性分析显示了特征影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商业可穿戴设备的稀疏数据进行个人化睡眠预测提供了稳健、适配性和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

TL;DR: GSTBench是首个系统评估图自监督学习方法跨数据集迁移能力的基准测试，发现大多数图SSL方法泛化能力差，而GraphMAE方法表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图自监督学习方法主要在单数据集上开发和评估，缺乏对跨数据集迁移性的系统研究，限制了知识迁移和大规模预训练的能力

Method: 构建GSTBench基准，在ogbn-papers100M上进行大规模预训练，评估5种代表性SSL方法在多样化目标图上的表现，标准化实验设置分离混杂因素

Result: 大多数图SSL方法泛化困难，有些甚至比随机初始化更差；GraphMAE（掩码自编码器方法）在迁移性能上表现一致优异

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图SSL方法迁移性的关键因素，为图学习的"预训练-迁移"范式奠定了坚实基础，为未来可迁移图SSL研究提供指导

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

TL;DR: 这是一个配置优先的框架，用于评估深度学习系统在CPU、GPU和编译运行时之间的跨后端兼容性，通过系统化方法量化和减少漏流问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在不同运行后端上存在表现差异，影响部署的可靠性和一致性，需要一个统一框架来系统化评估和缓解这些问题。

Method: 使用YAML配置文件将实验与代码解耦，支持库和仓库模型，采用三层验证协议（张量级别接近度、激活对齐、任务级指标）进行评估。

Result: 通过672次检测发现，72.0%的运行通过检测，大多数差异出现在更严格的容差阈值下。检测模型和编译后端容易出现漏流，主要原因是非确定性后处理。确定性适配器和选择性回退能够显著提高一致性而不影响性能。

Conclusion: 该框架是首个统一的系统化方法，能够量化和减少深度学习中的跨后端漏流问题，为异构运行时环境下的可靠部署提供了可复现的方法论。

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Conclusion: 所提出的Kriging-HDMR主动学习方法能有效处理高维可靠性分析问题，在计算效率和预测精度方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

Conclusion: NSATP方法有效平衡了时间序列预测中的可预测性和非稳态性问题，通过稳态化和非稳态恢复的结合，显著提升了公交车到达时间多步预测的准确性

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在安全性、质量和效率方面达到优越平衡，有害响应率低，用户体验干扰最小，同时保持高响应质量

Conclusion: CARE框架通过精确干预、及时纠正和有效自校正，实现了解码时安全对齐的优越安全-质量权衡

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

Conclusion: 该朴学习方法能够更准确地重现流行病曲线，实现了高效实用的模型检定，尽管接触率和传播概率存在部分不可识别性

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

TL;DR: 提出了一种递归扩展的线性PASFA算法，用于从观测数据和模型中推断慢特征状态，解决了现有方法难以恢复原始慢特征表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率自适应慢特征分析(PASFA)方法虽然能够学习有效的分类表示，但缺乏从观测数据和模型高效推断慢特征状态的方法。当前使用卡尔曼滤波的方法在将ARMA过程转换为状态空间模型后，难以恢复原始的有用慢特征表示。

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了所提出技术的正确性，证明了该方法能够有效推断慢特征状态。

Conclusion: 该递归扩展方法为从PASFA模型中高效推断慢特征状态提供了一种有效解决方案，解决了现有方法在恢复原始慢特征表示方面的局限性。

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

Motivation: 贝叶斯方法为不确定性下的序列决策提供原则性工具，但对所有参数依赖概率模型会阻碍复杂结构约束的融入。

Method: 仅在关注组件上放置先验，通过轮廓似然消除冗余参数，自然处理约束。开发了MINTS（简约Thompson采样）算法。

Result: 框架适用于结构化问题（连续臂Lipschitz赌博机、动态定价），为经典凸优化算法提供概率视角，对多臂赌博机建立了近乎最优的遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 该简约贝叶斯框架成功解决了复杂约束下的序列决策问题，提供了处理结构化问题的有效方法，并在理论和应用层面都取得了良好结果。

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Method: 使用LPCMCI框架和GPDC方法分析1970-2021年季度数据，揭示宏观经济指标间的因果结构；采用Chronos大型语言模型进行失业率的零样本概率预测，生成90%置信区间。

Result: 发现经济增长对GDP存在稳健的单向因果联系，通胀指标连通性有限；失业率预测在一季度和两季度前都能提供准确预测，置信区间支持有效的异常检测。

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了因果结构学习与概率语言模型结合的价值，为经济政策提供信息支持并增强预测稳健性，证明了零样本预测在宏观经济分析中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统比较了CNN和视觉Transformer在光伏热故障检测中的性能，利用XRAI显著性分析验证模型决策与热物理原理的一致性，为AI在能源监测中的可解释性提供方法论支撑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工智能在光伏监测中遇到的可解释性障碍，确保模型决策与热物理原理一致，以消除部署疑虑。

Method: 系统比较ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0等CNN模型与ViT-Tiny、Swin-Tiny等视觉Transformer模型，使用XRAI显著性分析评估模型与热物理原理的一致性，基于20,000张红外图像进行评测。

Result: Swin Transformer获得最高性能（二元精度94%，多类精度73%）。XRAI分析显示模型学习到了物理意义特征，如热点、热道等。但不同故障类型性能差异显著，电气故障检测效果优（F1>0.90），环境因素如污染故障检测难度大（F1 0.20-0.33）。

Conclusion: 热物理导向的可解释性方法为验证AI在能源监测中的决策提供了方法论支撑，有助于光伏等可再生能源基础设施中的AI部署。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

Motivation: 现代深度学习模型中高维线性映射占据了大部分参数和计算成本，需要更高效的替代方案

Method: 使用样条查找表实现的可训练低维多变量函数来表达高维映射，每个函数包含数十到数百个可训练参数但计算成本很低

Result: lmKANs在推理FLOPs上减少高达6.0倍，在甲烷配置数据集上实现10倍以上的H100吞吐量提升，在CNN框架中CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1k上分别减少1.6-2.1倍和1.7倍FLOPs

Conclusion: lmKANs提供了一种高效的高维映射替代方案，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算成本，适用于各种深度学习架构

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

Motivation: 传统的欧几里得归一化层不适用于流形数据，而许多黎曼流形具有陀螺结构，需要一种原则性的方法来扩展批量归一化到非欧几里得域

Method: 提出GyroBN框架，建立伪约简和陀螺等距陀螺两个必要条件来保证理论控制样本统计，并将现有黎曼归一化方法作为特例纳入框架

Conclusion: GyroBN提供了一个统一的黎曼批量归一化框架，在多种几何结构上表现出有效性，代码已开源

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有的图基础模型(GFMs)在代表性不足的数据集上训练，泛化性能有限。而表格基础模型(TFMs)在多个领域表现出色，因此考虑将节点分类重新表述为表格问题来利用TFMs的优势。

Method: 1) 通过特征和结构编码器将图转换为表格格式；2) 使用多个TFMs对多样采样子表格进行处理；3) 通过集成选择方法聚合不同TFMs的输出结果。

Conclusion: 表格化重构为可扩展和可泛化的图学习提供了有前景的新途径，证明了利用表格基础模型处理图学习问题的有效性。

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

Conclusion: 该方法成功垩接了高速度粗略近似和高质量精确方法之间的间隔，为交互式数据可视化提供了一种新的效率高、灵活性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏形式化的单次评估方法来量化Transformer电路的行为一致性和可信度，需要一种能够同时评估局部一致性和全局因果涌现的指标。

Method: 基于层/上同调和因果涌现理论，结合局部雅可比矩阵和激活值计算归一化的层不一致性，以及基于前向状态的高斯有效信息代理，构建EICS评分。

Result: 提出了EICS评分框架，该方法是白盒、单次计算的，具有无量纲特性，并提供了评分解释指南和计算开销分析。

Conclusion: EICS为评估Transformer电路的行为一致性和因果涌现提供了形式化工具，但还需要在LLM任务上进行实证验证。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted

Result: 理论分析了表示学习阶段，实证表明Fed-REACT在真实数据集上实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: Fed-REACT框架有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异质性和演化问题，提升了模型性能

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

Result: 量化导致logits方差降低、损失增加、群体准确率下降，对梯度范数和Hessian特征值产生不利影响

Conclusion: 通过混合精度QAT与加权损失函数相结合的方法，可以实现量化神经网络的公平部署

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical investigation into fine-tuning model
parameters for mathematical reasoning tasks through experimenting with various
configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling
strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency
as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps
(4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining
optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization
study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a
standardized production-oriented parameter optimization framework, (3)
discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model
architectures, and (4) production-ready configurations with extensive
performance characterization.

*Shalev Manor,Mohammad Kohandel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IP-Basis PINNs是一种元学习框架，通过离线-在线分解解决物理信息神经网络在多查询逆问题中的计算效率问题，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在解决多查询逆问题时，每个新观测数据集都需要重新进行昂贵的训练过程，计算成本过高。

Method: 采用离线-在线分解策略：离线训练深度网络生成参数化微分方程解空间的基函数；在线冻结网络，仅训练轻量级线性输出层进行解重构和参数识别。

Result: 在三个不同基准测试中表现优异，包括扩展到未知函数项的通用PINNs，在常数和函数参数估计中表现一致，比标准PINNs显著提速，在稀缺和噪声数据下鲁棒运行。

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs为多查询逆问题提供了高效解决方案，通过创新的损失函数、前向模式自动微分和验证机制实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

TL;DR: GCond是一种基于PCGrad原理的多任务学习梯度冲突解决方法，通过梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制实现计算加速和性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度冲突解决方法（如PCGrad、CAGrad、GradNorm）计算成本高，限制了其在大模型和Transformer中的应用

Method: 结合PCGrad原理、梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制，提出Gradient Conductor (GCond)方法

Result: 在ImageNet 1K和头颈部CT数据集上，GCond实现了两倍计算加速，在所有评估指标上表现优异，L1和SSIM损失更低，具有良好的可扩展性和优化器兼容性

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合变分贝叶斯推断和物理约束，有效地解决了从噪声稀疏数据中学习复杂哈密顿动力学的挑战

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将密码解密作为研究神经网络在组合复杂领域中泛化能力的理想测试平台，该任务需要从26!种可能的映射中选择正确的替换密码。

Method: 开发了ALICE架构，使用仅编码器Transformer和新型双射解码头，通过Gumbel-Sinkhorn方法显式建模排列，可以直接提取学习到的密码映射。

Result: ALICE在仅训练约1500个独特密码（占可能密码空间的极小部分3.7×10^{-24}）后就能泛化到未见过的密码，并通过早期退出分析揭示了模型逐步细化预测的过程。

Conclusion: 该架构创新和分析方法可扩展到任何具有双射映射和组合结构的领域，为神经网络泛化能力和可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 将复杂的病人情况转换为NCCN指南一致的治疗建议耗时且容易出错，需要专业知识，LLM技术有望缩短时间并提高准确性

Method: 构建121例NSCLC病人纵向数据集，专家注解NCCN指南路径；使用LLM生成高质量代理评测标准；开发混合人工注释和模型一致性的机器人框架和验证分类器

Result: 与专家注释标准强相关性（Spearman r=0.88，RMSE=0.08）；治疗建议预测准确度AUROC=0.800，具有检验准确性的检查能力

Conclusion: 建立了临床可行的LLM基于指南遵循系统框架，在准确性、可解释性和满足监管要求之间取得平衡，减少注释成本，为自动化临床决策支持提供可扩展路径

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

Motivation: 人口统计学属性在电子健康记录中普遍存在且是重要的临床风险预测因子，但传统上在模型设计中仅作为辅助角色，缺乏专门的表示学习方法。

Method: 提出GDP模型架构，探索不同的排序策略和编码方法，将表格人口统计输入转换为潜在嵌入表示，并在不同地理区域、疾病类型的数据集上进行预训练和评估。

Result: 实验结果表明顺序排序策略显著提升了模型在判别、校准和决策树分裂信息增益方面的性能，特别是在年龄和性别对风险分层贡献显著的疾病中效果更明显。

Conclusion: 针对表格人口统计学属性的基础模型可以跨任务和人群泛化，为提升医疗健康应用的预测性能提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

Conclusion: FedTeddi算法能有效处理动态演化数据，使联邦边缘学习系统能够快速学习新数据而不遗忘先前知识

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

Method: 提出两种技术：1）单向排序平滑改善输出空间核平滑性；2）基于单向排序平滑的自适应随机傅里叶特征，根据层间参数数量调整输入编码频率带宽

Conclusion: SBS方法有效解决了神经网络权重表示中的频谱偏置问题，在参数压缩和重建精度方面优于现有技术

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection

creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the

attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our

TL;DR: 通过使用质量覆盖的f-散度（如前向KL散度和JS散度）作为复习机制，DPH-RL框架解决了RLVR精细调整中多次尝试性能的退化问题，同时提升单次尝试准确性和基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在RLVR精细调整中常见的问题：多次尝试性能（Pass@k）退化而单次尝试准确性（Pass@1）提升，以及灾难性遗忘现象。标准RLVR方法缺乏知识保持机制。

Method: 提出DPH-RL框架，利用质量覆盖的f-散度（前向KL散度和JS散度）作为复习机制，持续参考初始策略以保持广泛的解决方案覆盖范围。该方法通过生成器函数计算f-散度，仅需从初始策略采样，无需在线参考模型。

Result: 在数学和SQL生成任务上的实验表明，DPH-RL不仅解决了Pass@k退化问题，还在域内和域外都提升了Pass@1和Pass@k性能。同时该方法训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 选择合适的散度测量是改善RLVR的关键因素，DPH-RL框架通过保持知识多样性，能够构建更通用和多样化的推理模型。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Motivation: 卷积字典学习(CDL)在建模信号局部结构方面很强大，但在检测罕见或异常事件方面尚未充分探索，面临高计算成本和对异常敏感的挑战。

Method: RoseCDL结合随机窗口化实现在大数据集上的高效训练，并通过在线异常检测增强鲁棒性，隔离异常模式。

Conclusion: RoseCDL为大规模信号中的罕见事件检测提供了一个实用且高效的解决方案，扩展了CDL的应用范围。

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

TL;DR: 提出了ΔL归一化方法，专门针对RLVR中动态生成长度特性设计的损失聚合方法，解决了梯度方差高和优化不稳定问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升大语言模型推理能力方面显示出强大潜力，但训练过程中响应长度的大幅变化导致高梯度方差和不稳定优化，现有方法存在估计偏差或高方差问题

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，将问题重新表述为寻找最小方差无偏估计量，提出ΔL归一化方法

Result: 在多种模型大小、最大长度和任务上均取得优异结果，理论上既能提供无偏估计又能最小化梯度方差

Conclusion: ΔL归一化是一个简单有效的损失聚合方法，能够显著改善RLVR训练稳定性并提升性能

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经元使用加权和加固定非线性激活函数，缺乏对不确定性和多模态的建模能力。uGMM-NN旨在将概率推理直接嵌入神经网络的计算单元中。

Method: 每个uGMM-NN节点将其激活参数化为单变量高斯混合模型，具有可学习的均值、方差和混合系数，替代传统的加权和加非线性激活函数。

Result: uGMM-NN在判别性能上与传统多层感知器相当，同时提供了激活的概率解释，能够捕获单个神经元层面的多模态性和不确定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为将不确定性感知组件集成到现代神经架构中奠定了基础，为判别性和生成性建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出PINNs的双重公式化方法，为周期性热导复合材料均质化提供可靠的上界和下界误差估计，提高对材料不连续性的处理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络在处理具有不连续系数的材料时容易失败，特别是在分段常数属性的介质中，需要更可靠的方法来检测PINN故障

Method: 引入双重公式化PINN框架，比较标准PINN与变分PINN(VPINN)，使用谱方法和神经网络基测试函数，为强形式和变分形式提供保证误差边界

Result: 强形式PINN在受控环境下可能优于VPINN，但对材料不连续性敏感且故障诊断不明确；VPINN能直接处理分段常数材料参数但需要仔细选择测试函数

Conclusion: 双重公式化可作为收敛质量的可靠指标，将其集成到PINN框架中增强了在微力学均质化问题中的适用性

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing
operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

Method: 系统评估多种二元分类器在真实和合成数据集上的鲁棒性，采用一次性学习和少样本学习作为基线，通过合成决策边界生成来模拟不同数据复杂度，同时包含欠采样、过采样和单类分类方法的对比实验。

Result: 随着数据复杂度增加和少数类样本减少，分类难度显著增加。传统分类器在极端不平衡情况下性能恶化，但TabPFN和基于boosting的集成模型保持相对较高的性能和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本研究为不平衡学习中的模型选择提供了有价值的指导，揭示了在不依赖显式重平衡技术的情况下分类器的鲁棒性，建议在极端不平衡场景中优先考虑TabPFN和boosting集成模型。

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了IBN网络，通过不确定性感知插值和双向建模解决多元时间序列预测中的变量缺失问题，在多种缺失率场景下达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时空图神经网络难以处理变量缺失问题，现有方法GinAR缺乏可解释性且无法捕捉潜在时间模式

Method: 集成不确定性感知插值(UAI)和基于高斯核的图卷积(GGCN)，使用MC Dropout估计重建值的不确定性，采用双向递归单元增强时间依赖建模

Result: 在多种缺失率场景下实现了最先进的预测性能

Conclusion: IBN为变量缺失的多元时间序列预测提供了更可靠和可解释的框架

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MoE模型在LLM学习中的广泛应用，在有限GPU内存约束下高效服务MoE模型成为重要挑战。将非激活专家卸载到主内存是有效方法，但带来了专家在GPU内存和主内存间传输的挑战，需要探索高效的专家压缩方法并分析压缩误差对推理性能的影响。

Method: 提出使用误差有界损失压缩算法（如SZ3和CuSZp）压缩非激活专家，通过大量实验分析不同专家压缩误差对整体推理精度的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明：浅层专家（主要负责注意力机制和输入token向量化）在误差有界压缩下推理精度下降最小；中间层专家（模型推理核心）的误差会显著损害推理精度；深层专家（主要负责指令跟随和输出整合）引入有界误差有时反而能提高推理精度。

Conclusion: 误差有界压缩是减少MoE推理中数据传输开销的有效方法，但需要针对不同层级专家的功能特点采用差异化的压缩策略，浅层和深层专家对压缩误差容忍度较高，而中间层专家需要更严格的误差控制。

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

Conclusion: 提供了一种可行的个性化能病药物组合屏幕早期决策方案，有助于更有效的个性化疗法开发

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测脑转移瘤胆剩病变化对PULSAR治疗具有重要的预后价值，需要开发更量化个性化的预测方法。

Method: 采用39名患者的69个脑转移瘤数据，提取影像组学和放射组学特征，计算delta特征描述相对变化。使用Lasso算法进行特征选择，构建支持向量回归模型，采用5折交叉验证。

Result: 多组学模型表现最佳，R2达到0.743，RRMSE为0.022。delta影像组学特征显著提升了预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该多组学SVR模型能够准确预测GTV连续变化，为PULSAR治疗提供了量化个性化的患者选择和治疗调整帮助。

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Motivation: 传统EEG睡眠监测设备笨重不便，无法在日常家庭环境中长期使用。耳内EEG设备可以提供无创、舒适的睡眠监测方案，特别适用于检测入睡时刻以支持消费应用

Method: 使用11名参与者进行睡眠研究，采用定制耳塞设备（干耳尖电极）采集单通道耳内电生理信号，以Apple Watch Ultra作为地面真值参考，使用留一法交叉验证

Result: 系统在二元睡眠检测（清醒vs睡眠）上达到90.5%准确率，在四分类分期（清醒、REM、核心睡眠、深度睡眠）上达到65.1%准确率

Conclusion: 耳内电极具有作为低负担、舒适睡眠监测方法的潜力，特别适用于检测入睡时刻以自动暂停媒体播放等消费应用

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Motivation: 现有算法在静态或可预测环境中表现不佳，无法实现最优的动态对偶间隔性能。

Method: 提出包含三个核心模块的模块化算法：适应模块、多预测器聚合器和集成模块，动态调整非稳态性并结合多种预测器优势。

Result: 算法实现了最小最大最优的D-DGap上界（至对数因子），同时保证预测错误驱动的D-DGap界限。

Conclusion: 模块化设计提供了灵活性和适应性，实验结果证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and ontologies represent entities and their relationships in
a structured way, having gained significance in the development of modern AI
applications. Integrating these semantic resources with machine learning models
often relies on knowledge graph embedding models to transform graph data into
numerical representations. Therefore, pre-trained models for popular knowledge
graphs and ontologies are increasingly valuable, as they spare the need to
retrain models for different tasks using the same data, thereby helping to
democratize AI development and enabling sustainable computing.
  In this paper, we present Bio-KGvec2go, an extension of the KGvec2go Web API,
designed to generate and serve knowledge graph embeddings for widely used
biomedical ontologies. Given the dynamic nature of these ontologies,
Bio-KGvec2go also supports regular updates aligned with ontology version

Conclusion: 逆问题方法可以高效地揭示缩放定律，为构建大语言模型提供更经济有效的指导

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

TL;DR: ScaleZero通过MoE架构和动态参数缩放策略，在异构多任务学习中解决了梯度冲突和模型塑性损失问题，实现了与专用单任务基线相当的性能，同时只需80%的环境交互步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务世界模型（如UniZero）在处理大规模异构环境时面临梯度冲突和模型塑性损失的问题，限制了样本和计算效率。

Method: 采用混合专家（MoE）架构缓解梯度冲突，并提出基于LoRA的动态参数缩放（DPS）策略，根据任务进度动态调整计算负载。

Result: 在Atari、DMControl和Jericho基准测试中，ScaleZero仅使用在线强化学习就达到了与专用单任务基线相当的性能，使用DPS后只需80%的环境交互步骤。

Conclusion: ScaleZero展示了在大规模多任务学习中有效解决梯度冲突和计算效率问题的潜力，为异构多任务学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available
at \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/opendilab/LightZero}.

Motivation: 多模态多任务基础模型在教育领域有转型潜力，但遍部署遇到隐私法规、数据孤岛和领域特定数据稀缺的挑战。需要一种能够在保护隐私的前提下进行协作学习的方案。

Method: 结合联盟学习(FL)和多模态多份务基础模型(M3T FMs)，在去中心化机构之间进行协作性、隐私保护的训练，同时支持多样化模态和任务。

Result: 提出了M3T FedFMs框架，能够推进下一代智能教育系统的三大核心架构：隐私保护(保持敏感多模态数据本地化)、个性化(通过模块化架构实现定制模型)、公平性和包容性(促进资源受限实体参与)。

Conclusion: M3T FedFMs是一种有前景但尚未充分探索的教育方案。需要重点研究异构隐私规定、数据模态特性不均匀、去学习方法、持续学习框架和模型可解释性等关键挑战，以支撑其在实际遇部署中的应用。

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

TL;DR: ACE方法通过自训练和选择性分歧来解决完全伪相关导致的模型欠规范问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异，且适用于语言模型对齐任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对伪相关非常敏感，当伪相关完全时，正确的泛化是根本性的欠规范问题，需要新的方法来解决这种不确定性。

Method: 提出ACE方法，学习一组与训练数据一致但在新未标记输入上做出不同预测的概念，采用自训练方法鼓励自信和选择性分歧。

Result: ACE在完全伪相关基准测试中匹配或超越现有方法，同时对不完全伪相关保持鲁棒性，在语言模型对齐任务中无需访问不可信测量即可实现竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ACE在克服模型欠规范方面取得了显著进展，虽然仍有重要限制，但为处理完全伪相关问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力的低维投影导致信息损失，且对所有输入对使用相同评分函数，缺乏对序列中相邻token的距离依赖性计算偏置。

Method: 使用计算高效的高秩结构化矩阵（BTT和MLR）构建新的注意力评分函数，能够编码全秩或距离依赖的计算偏置。

Result: 在高维输入的上下文回归任务中，任何固定计算预算下都优于标准注意力；在语言建模中，MLR注意力相比标准注意力和滑动窗口注意力变体实现了更好的缩放规律；在长程时间序列预测中也显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: BTT和MLR属于更广泛的能编码全秩或距离依赖计算偏置的高效结构化矩阵家族，有效解决了标准注意力的显著缺陷。

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

Result: 学习率预热能一致加速梯度下降收敛，在某些特定情况下比非递增学习率快Θ(T)倍

Conclusion: 学习率预热策略在优化理论角度具有明确优势，为大规模深度神经网络训练提供了理论支持

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

Abstract: This paper proposes a linear input-output observer design methodology for a
population of systems in which each observer uses knowledge of the linear
time-invariant dynamics of the particular device. Observers are typically
composed of a known model of the system and a correction mechanism to produce
an estimate of the state. The proposed design procedure characterizes the
variation within the population in the frequency domain and synthesizes a
single robust correction filter. The correction filter is compatible with all
system models that satisfy the variation characterization such that a given
level of estimation performance is guaranteed. This is accomplished by posing a
robust performance problem using the observer error dynamics and solving it
using $DK$-iteration. The design procedure is experimentally demonstrated on a
flexible joint robotic manipulator with varied joint stiffnesses. It is shown
that the proposed method that uses a single correction filter achieves
comparable estimation performance to a method that uses a correction gain
tailored toward each joint stiffness configuration.

Abstract: This study investigates market-driven long-term investment decisions in
distributed solar panels by individual investors. We consider a setting where
investment decisions are driven by expected revenue from participating in
short-term electricity markets over the panel's lifespan. These revenues depend
on short-term markets equilibria, i.e., prices and allocations, which are
influenced by aggregate invested panel capacity participating in the markets.
We model the interactions among investors by a non-atomic game and develop a
framework that links short-term markets equilibria to the resulting long-term
investment equilibrium. Then, within this framework, we analyze three market
mechanisms: (a) a single-product real-time energy market, (b) a
product-differentiated real-time energy market that treats solar energy and
grid energy as different products, and (c) a contract-based panel market that
trades claims or rights to the production of certain panel capacity ex-ante,
rather than the realized solar production ex-post. For each, we derive
expressions for short-term equilibria and the associated expected revenues, and
analytically characterize the corresponding long-term Nash equilibrium
aggregate capacity. We compare the solutions of these characterizing equations
under different conditions and theoretically establish that the
product-differentiated market always supports socially optimal investment,
while the single-product market consistently results in under-investment. We
also establish that the contract-based market leads to over-investment when the
extra valuations of users for solar energy are small. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings through numerical experiments.

Motivation: 解决学习未知非线性耗散动力系统的神经Koopman算子模型时如何保证耗散性的问题

Method: 两阶段方法：先学习无约束的神经Koopman模型近似系统动力学，然后最小扰动参数以强制严格耗散性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习具有耗散性保证的神经Koopman模型，为非线性动力系统控制提供理论保障

Abstract: We address the problem of learning a neural Koopman operator model that
provides dissipativity guarantees for an unknown nonlinear dynamical system
that is known to be dissipative. We propose a two-stage approach. First, we
learn an unconstrained neural Koopman model that closely approximates the
system dynamics. Then, we minimally perturb the parameters to enforce strict
dissipativity. Crucially, we establish theoretical guarantees that extend the
dissipativity properties of the learned model back to the original nonlinear
system. We realize this by deriving an exact relationship between the
dissipativity of the learned model and the true system through careful
characterization of the identification errors from the noisy data, Koopman
operator truncation, and generalization to unseen data. We demonstrate our
approach through simulation on a Duffing oscillator model.

Conclusion: 该集成设计有效解决了异构多智能体系统在时变拓扑下的安全共识控制问题，数值仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: A distributed adaptive control strategy is developed for heterogeneous
multiagent systems in nonlinear Brunovsky form with \({\pd}\)-dimensional
$n^{\text{th}}$-order dynamics, operating under time-triggered switching
communication topologies. The approach uses repulsive potential functions to
ensure agent-agent and obstacle safety, while neural network estimators
compensate for system uncertainties and disturbances. A high-order control
barrier function framework is then employed to certify the positive invariance
of the safe sets and the boundedness of the proposed control inputs. The
resulting distributed control and adaptive laws, together with dwell-time
requirements for topology transitions, achieve leader-following consensus. This
integrated design provides synchronized formation and robust disturbance
rejection in evolving network configurations, and its effectiveness is
demonstrated through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: 该模型成功描述了资源约束下多智能体意见形成的动力学特性，为理解社会网络中意见演化提供了理论框架，仿真结果验证了理论发现。

Abstract: We propose a model of opinion formation on resource allocation among multiple
topics by multiple agents, who are subject to hard budget constraints. We
define a utility function for each agent and then derive a projected dynamical
system model of opinion evolution assuming that each agent myopically seeks to
maximize its utility subject to its constraints. Inter-agent coupling arises
from an undirected social network, while inter-topic coupling arises from
resource constraints. We show that opinions always converge to the equilibrium
set. For special networks with very weak antagonistic relations, the opinions
converge to a unique equilibrium point. We further show that the underlying
opinion formation game is a potential game. We relate the equilibria of the
dynamics and the Nash equilibria of the game and characterize the unique Nash
equilibrium for networks with no antagonistic relations. Finally, simulations
illustrate our findings.

<details>

Motivation: 现代可再生能源主导的电力网给面临低惯性和非线性频率响应的安全风险，需要稳健的故障前频率安全评估方法

Method: 提出数据知识融合框架：1）物理指导知识用于神经网络预训练；2）物理约束知识确保预测在理论范围内；双通道神经网络捐捕局部和全局特征；融合训练算法

Result: 在云南省网验证：平均预测误差降至1.26%（比49.2%），未训练场景准确率达97.60%（提高3.85%），满足实际电网的准确性、可靠性和普适性要求

Conclusion: 该方法为增强电力网频率安全评估的稳健性建立了新范式，具有跨领域安全评估的潜在应用价值

Abstract: Frequency security is critical for power grids, as deviations can trigger
widespread outages and result in substantial economic losses. However, modern
renewable-dominated power grids face an increased risk of insecurity due to low
inertia and nonlinear frequency responses. To mitigate these risks, robust
pre-fault frequency security assessment (FSA) is critical, which enables grid
operators to implement preventive control strategies. We propose a
data-knowledge fusion framework to achieve intelligent FSA in actual power
grids. First, we classify FSA domain knowledge into two distinct categories:
(1) physics-guided knowledge directs the neural network pre-training process,
ensuring that the fusion model's predictions consistent with frequency response
mechanisms, and (2) physics-constrained knowledge establishes quantitative
relationship on predictions, which forces them within theoretical ranges
defined by domain knowledge. Furthermore, we develop a dual-channel neural
network architecture to simultaneously capture both local and global
characteristics of the power system. Finally, we introduce a data-knowledge
fusion training algorithm that integrates guided learning with constrained
network architecture to enhance model reliability and generalization. Case
studies on China's Yunnan Provincial Power Grid validate the superior
performance of our framework: it reduces average prediction error to 1.26% (a
49.2% reduction over data-driven methods), and maintains 97.60% accuracy in
untrained scenarios (3.85% higher than data-driven methods), therefore
satisfies the accuracy, reliability, and generalization requirements for actual
power grids. The proposed methodology establishes a new paradigm for enhancing
robustness of FSA in power grids, with potential application to cross-domain
security assessment.

Conclusion: 该方法结合了低计算负担和改善的调节性能，具有更高的实际应用性，在复杂电力系统中展现出明显的实用效果和优势。

Abstract: High penetration of renewable energy sources intensifies frequency
fluctuations in multi-area power systems, challenging both stability and
operational safety. This paper proposes a novel distributed frequency control
method that ensures transient frequency safety and enforces generation capacity
constraints, while achieving steady-state frequency restoration and optimal
economic operation. The method integrates a feedback optimization (FO)-based
controller and a safety corrector. The FO-based controller generates reference
setpoints by solving an optimization problem, driving the system to the steady
state corresponding to the optimal solution of this problem. The safety
corrector then modifies these references using control barrier functions to
maintain frequencies within prescribed safe bounds during transients while
respecting capacity constraints. The proposed method combines low computational
burden with improved regulation performance and enhanced practical
applicability. Theoretical analysis establishes optimality, asymptotic
stability, and transient frequency safety for the closed-loop system.
Simulation studies show that, compared with conventional FO-based schemes, the
method consistently enforces frequency safety and capacity limits, achieves
smaller frequency deviations and faster recovery, thereby demonstrating its
practical effectiveness and advantages.

Abstract: To address non-linear disturbances and uncertainties in complex marine
environments, this paper proposes a disturbance-resistant controller for
deep-sea cranes. The controller integrates hierarchical sliding mode control,
adaptive control, and neural network compensation techniques. By designing a
global sliding mode surface, the dynamic coordination between the driving and
non-driving subsystems is achieved, ensuring overall system stability. The
subsystem surfaces reduce oscillations and enhance tracking accuracy. Adaptive
control dynamically adjusts system parameters, enhancing robustness against
external uncertainties, while the neural network compensates for time-varying
disturbances through real-time learning. The stability of the control scheme is
verified on the basis of Lyapunov theory. The simulation results demonstrate
that, compared to traditional PID control, the proposed controller exhibits
significant advantages in trajectory tracking accuracy, response speed, and
disturbance rejection.

Result: 通过不变集约束保证递归可行性，在多重不确定性下严格证明了均方输入到状态稳定性

Conclusion: 工业电加热系统模拟验证了方法的有效性，能够显著降低通信负荷

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified adaptive event-triggered model predictive
control (ETMPC) scheme for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems subject to
state delays, actuator saturation, and external disturbances. In existing
studies, only a limited number of ETMPC methods have attempted to address
either state delays or actuator saturation, and even these few methods
typically lack co-design optimization between adaptive event-triggering
mechanisms and the control law. To overcome these limitations, this paper
presents a Lyapunov-Krasovskii-based adaptive ETMPC strategy that enables the
co-design optimization of both the triggering mechanism and the controller.
Specifically, the event-triggering parameter matrix is adaptively optimized by
embedding an internal adaptive variable within the Lyapunov-Krasovskii-like
function. Furthermore, the actuator saturation nonlinearity is transformed into
a convex hull representation. The infinite-horizon robust optimization problem
is reformulated as a convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequality
(LMI) constraints. Invariant set constraints are introduced to ensure recursive
feasibility, and mean-square input-to-state stability (ISS) under multiple
uncertainties is rigorously established. Simulations on an industrial electric
heating system validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing
communication load.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless
connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management.
By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency
through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature
monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based
visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by
overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This
approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature
scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across
methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration
significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions
and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical,
user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living
goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.

Abstract: This paper presents a kernel-based framework for physics-informed nonlinear
system identification. The key contribution is a structured methodology that
extends kernel-based techniques to seamlessly integrate partially known
physics-based models, improving parameter estimation and overall model
accuracy. The proposed method enhances traditional modeling approaches by
integrating a parametric model, which provides physical interpretability, with
a kernel-based function, which accounts for unmodelled dynamics. The two
model's components are identified from data simultaneously, minimizing a
suitable cost that balances the relative importance of the physical and the
black-box parts of the model. Additionally, nonlinear state smoothing is
employed to address scenarios involving state-space models with not fully
measurable states. Numerical simulations on an experimental benchmark system
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with performance
comparisons against state-of-the-art identification techniques.

Abstract: This article proposes a distributed control method for matrix-scaled
multi-agent networks aimed at achieving convergence within a user-defined time
frame. The control law of each individual agent relies only on information from
neighboring agents and is updated at discrete intervals determined by
state-dependent triggering functions, reducing the frequency of agent
interactions. To this end, first, the controller is augmented with a
time-varying gain. Then, the dynamics of the closed-loop system over the
finite-time interval is transformed into an infinite-time frame using time
scaling. Lyapunov-based analysis is employed to derive suitable triggering
conditions that guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the time-transformed
system, thereby ensuring the prescribed-time convergence of the original
system.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of state estimation in multivariable dynamic
systems with quantized outputs, a common scenario in applications involving
low-resolution sensors or communication constraints. A novel method is proposed
to explicitly construct the probability mass function associated with the
quantized measurements by approximating the indicator function of each region
defined by the quantizer using Gaussian mixture models. Unlike previous
approaches, this technique generalizes to any number of quantized outputs
without requiring case-specific numerical solutions, making it a scalable and
efficient solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed filter
achieves high accuracy in state estimation, both in terms of fidelity of the
filtering distributions and mean squared error, while maintaining significantly
reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Technological advancements in miniaturization and wireless communications are
yielding more affordable and versatile sensors and, in turn, more applications
in which a network of sensors can be actively managed to best support overall
decision-making objectives. We propose modeling the opportunity for sensor
management within multi-stage stochastic control problems with imperfect state
information. Such formulations inherently assume the state of the modeled
environment cannot be accessed directly but instead the controller can observe
only noisy measurements of the state and, therefore, at each decision stage
some form of state estimation is required before a control is actuated. The
notion of sensor management arises when the modeled controls not only affect
the subsequent evolution of the state but can also affect the nature of future
measurements and, hence, the quality of state estimates that drive future
control decisions. In principle, the optimal strategy for any appropriately
modeled multi-stage stochastic control problem with imperfect state information
(with or without opportunity for sensor management) is the solution to a
dynamic program; in practice, the computational requirements are typically
prohibitive yet dynamic programming methods are still useful to guide the
development of effective suboptimal strategies. In this spirit, we model the
opportunity for sensor management within small-scale examples of two
well-studied dynamic programming formulations, namely (1) the
finite-state/finite-action Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process
(PO-MDP) and (2) the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian Regulator (LQGR). These examples
admit solvable dynamic programs and confirm how the interplay between sensing
and acting is a natural by-product of a dynamic programming solution.

Abstract: This paper presents an input-output feedback linearization (IOL)-based
guidance law to ensure interception in a pursuer-evader engagement scenario. A
point-mass dynamic model for both the pursuer and the evader is considered. An
IOL guidance law is derived using range and line-of-sight (LOS) rate
measurements. It is found that the range-based IOL guidance law exhibits a
singularity under certain conditions. To address this issue, a fuzzy logic
system is employed to smoothly blend the IOL guidance with the classical
proportional guidance law, thereby avoiding the singularity. In contrast, the
LOS-based IOL guidance law is free of singularities but suffers from divergence
issues due to angle-related complications. To resolve this, a simple correction
function is introduced to ensure consistent interception behavior. Results from
Monte Carlo simulations indicate that both modifications of the IOL guidance
laws cause interception with control limits applied.

Abstract: Distribution networks will experience more installations of distributed
generation (DG) that is unpredictable and stochastic in nature. Greater
distributed control and intelligence will allow challenges such as voltage
control to be handled effectively. The partitioning of power networks into
smaller clusters provides a method to split the control problem into manageable
sub-problems. This paper presents a community detection-based partitioning
technique for distribution networks considering local DGs, allowing them to be
grouped and controlled in a distributed manner by using local signals and
measurements. This method also allows each community to control the voltage
using only neighboring DGs, and for each community to self-organize to reflect
varying DG conditions and to maintain stable control. Simulations demonstrate
that the partitioning of the large distribution network is effective, and each
community is able to self-organize and to regulate the voltage independently
using only its local DGs.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个简单的马尔可夫决策过程模型来分析入侵容忍问题，发现在理想检测器情况下，防御性响应可能不是最优策略，防御开销可能超过安全失败的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究入侵容忍系统中防御响应和重置响应的最优策略，分析在不同攻击动态和响应效果下的最佳决策。

Method: 使用马尔可夫决策过程模型，假设攻击通过多个步骤进行，防御响应可能阻止攻击，重置响应可能恢复系统安全。

Result: 分析表明即使有完美检测器，防御性响应在长期来看可能是次优的；防御措施的总开销可能超过间歇性安全失败的总风险。

Conclusion: 系统恢复的最佳策略（反应式或主动式）取决于攻击动态和响应效果，论文还讨论了模型扩展方向如不完美检测器、多类型攻击等。

Abstract: We formulate and analyze a simplest Markov decision process model for
intrusion tolerance problems, assuming that (i) each attack proceeds through
one or more steps before the system's security fails, (ii) defensive responses
that target these intermediate steps may only sometimes thwart the attack and
(iii) reset responses that are sensible upon discovering an attack's completion
may not always recover from the security failure. The analysis shows that, even
in the ideal case of perfect detectors, it can be sub-optimal in the long run
to employ defensive responses while under attack; that is, depending on attack
dynamics and response effectiveness, the total overhead of ongoing defensive
countermeasures can exceed the total risk of intermittent security failures.
The analysis similarly examines the availability loss versus the risk reduction
of employing preemptive resets, isolating key factors that determine whether
system recovery is best initiated reactively or proactively. We also discuss
model extensions and related work looking towards intrusion tolerance
applications with (i) imperfect or controllable detectors, (ii) multiple types
of attacks, (iii) continuous-time dynamics or (iv) strategic attackers.

### [209] [Renewable Energy Sources Selection Analysis with the Maximizing Deviation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07011)
*Kirisci Murat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型，结合区间值Fermatean模糊集来处理部分已知特征权重问题，并将其应用于可再生能源选择决策问题。


<details>

Result: 提出的方法成功应用于可再生能源选择问题，能够有效处理决策过程中的不确定性和模糊性，为决策者提供更好的决策工具。

Conclusion: 结合Fermatean模糊集和偏差最大化方法的优化模型为多准则决策提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于处理可再生能源选择等具有不确定性和复杂性的决策问题，同时考虑了管理和政策层面的影响。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

### [210] [From Eigenmodes to Proofs: Integrating Graph Spectral Operators with Symbolic Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07017)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个完全谱神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构将逻辑规则嵌入为谱模板，在谱域直接进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统神经符号推理系统在可扩展性、适应性和可解释性方面的局限性，作者希望开发一个能够结合符号推理严谨性和神经网络学习能力的统一框架。

Method: 利用图信号处理和基于拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择性滤波器，将逻辑规则嵌入为谱模板。包含动态图和基学习、有理和扩散滤波器、谱专家混合、证明引导训练、不确定性量化等扩展功能。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等基准测试中，Spectral NSR相比transformer、消息传递神经网络和神经符号逻辑编程系统，实现了更高的准确性、更快的推理速度、更好的对抗鲁棒性和更强的可解释性。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了一个可扩展且原则性的基础框架，在透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面超越了传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future
directions.

TL;DR: Instruction Agent是一个GUI代理，通过专家演示提取分步指令并严格遵循用户轨迹来执行复杂任务，解决了现有GUI代理在处理新颖UI元素、长时程操作和个性化轨迹方面的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理在处理涉及新颖UI元素、长时程操作和个性化轨迹的复杂任务时表现不佳，需要一种能够利用专家演示来解决这些挑战的方法。

Method: 基于单次专家演示提取分步指令，严格遵循用户预期轨迹执行；引入验证器和回溯器模块来提高鲁棒性，处理意外中断和评估操作结果。

Result: 在OSWorld任务集上达到60%的成功率，而所有顶级代理之前都未能完成这些任务。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理与可靠的真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

TL;DR: 提出Language Self-Play (LSP)方法，通过自博弈强化学习让大语言模型无需额外数据就能自我提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型发展面临的数据依赖瓶颈问题，避免需要持续获取更多训练数据的限制

Method: 基于博弈论的自博弈框架，将模型能力视为竞争游戏中的表现，通过模型与自己对抗来产生更强的策略

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct上的实验显示，仅通过自博弈就能提升指令跟随任务的性能，且效果优于数据驱动基线方法

Conclusion: 自博弈强化学习是突破大语言模型数据依赖瓶颈的有效途径，能够实现无数据条件下的持续性能提升

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤神经活动(SKNA)作为交感神经系统活动的无创监测指标，但容易受肌电污某(EMG)干扰，传统滤波方法效果有限

Method: 采用轻量化一维卷积自动编码器网络，结合LSTM瓶颈结构，使用清洁SKNA数据和EMG噪声模拟污某进行训练，采用留一受试者交叉验证

Result: 信噪比提高达9.65dB，相关系数从0.40提升到0.72，疯爆特征识别能力恢复到清洁数据水平(AUROC≥0.96)，基线与压力条件分类准确率91-98%

Conclusion: 深度学习方法能够在严重EMG干扰下保留生理学相关的交感神经疯爆信息，为自然环境下的SKNA监测提供更稳健的方案

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL是一个结合部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习的框架，用于提升Text-to-SQL模型的执行准确率，在工业级数据库和复杂问题上达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要改进。

Method: 采用两种管道：(1)基于大语言模型的上下文学习框架和组自评估(verbal-RL)；(2)基于小模型(OmniSQL-7B)的思维链强化学习管道，使用特殊设计的奖励函数和两阶段RL训练。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA。在Spider2.0-SQLite基准上，verbal-RL管道比SOTA高7.4%，CoT管道高1.4%。混合SQL方言训练带来三倍增益。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠、SOTA级别的Text-to-SQL解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at
https://github.com/PaVeRL-SQL/PaVeRL-SQL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 每年数百万人通过法律援助热线、办公室或律师转介服务寻求法律帮助，错误分类会导致严重后果（错过截止日期、遭受虐待、失去住房或子女监护权等），需要准确识别法律问题以匹配正确的帮助。

Method: 采用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，结合自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，使用包含419个真实查询的新数据集进行评估。

Result: 分类准确率（hits@2）达到97.37%，使用低成本模型组合超越了当前最先进的GPT-5模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低法律系统用户引导成本的同时实现了高准确性，有望改善法律求助服务的匹配效率。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

Motivation: 当前广泛存在一种假设，认为语言模型生成的中间思维链长度反映了问题难度，但其实际机制不清楚。本文想要重点考察中间令牌序列长度是否真的与问题难度相关

Method: 使用A* 搜索算法的演绎迹跳训练变换器模型，因为A* 解决迷宫问题所需的操作步数可以精确量化问题复杂性。在简单的自由空间问题和分布外问题上进行系统性评估

Result: 发现即使在最简单的任务中，模型也经常会生成过长的推理迹跳，有时甚至无法生成解决方案。中间令牌长度与真实A* 迹跳长度只有弱相关性。仅在问题更接近训练数据分布时才会出现相关性

Conclusion: 中间迹跳生成并不是适应性地根据问题难度调整的，而是更多受券练数据分布的影响。这些结果挑战了将语言模型中间令牌解释为"思考"的假设，并警告不要将更长的序列自动解释为更多的"思考努力"

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代码进化方法（如AlphaEvolve）仅限于孤立的小规模代码片段，需要扩展到完整代码库规模来处理现实世界的复杂软件系统。

Method: 构建SATLUTION框架，使用LLM代理在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接进化求解器代码库，同时自我进化进化策略和规则。

Result: 从SAT Competition 2024代码库开始，SATLUTION进化的求解器在SAT Competition 2025中显著超越人类设计获胜者，并在2024基准测试中超越了2024和2025年的冠军。

Conclusion: SATLUTION成功证明了LLM代码进化可以扩展到完整代码库规模，在复杂算法问题上实现超越人类专家的性能，为自动化软件进化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

TL;DR: SheetDesigner是一个零样本、无需训练的电子表格布局生成框架，使用多模态大语言模型结合规则和视觉反射，在离散网格结构上优于现有方法22.6%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格具有丰富的结构化布局，但手动设计耗时且需要专业知识。现有自动布局模型不适合电子表格，因为它们忽略其离散网格结构和独特的语义关联

Method: 提出SheetDesigner框架，使用多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)，结合规则反射和视觉反射进行组件放置和内容填充，无需训练

Result: 在3,326个电子表格数据集上评估，SheetDesigner比5个基线方法至少提升22.6%。视觉模态能很好处理重叠和平衡，但对齐仍需混合策略

Conclusion: 通过结合规则和视觉反射的多模态方法，SheetDesigner能有效生成电子表格布局，解决了现有方法在离散网格结构和语义关联方面的不足

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Motivation: 深度学习在系统动力学建模中虽然提高了可扩展性和预测准确性，但牺牲了可解释性和因果可靠性，这在关键决策系统中是不可接受的。

Method: 提出混合框架，结合概念可解释性、机制可解释性和因果机器学习技术，构建基于语义有意义变量的神经网络模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法可以弥合黑盒预测模型与复杂动态环境中关键决策支持需求之间的差距，特别是在工业物联网支持的网络物理系统中。

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于激活值指导的提示注入攻击框架，通过能量模型和MCMC采样优化攻击提示，实现了高效的黑盒跨模型攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有白盒/灰盒攻击方法实用性低，黑盒攻击转移性差的问题，以应对直接提示注入攻击的安全威胁。

Method: 构建基于替代模型激活值的能量模型(EBM)评估攻击提示质量，继而使用标记级Markov链蒙特卡洛采样(MCMC)进行适应性优化，实现无梯度的黑盒攻击。

Result: 在5个主流LLM上达到49.6%的攻击成功率，比人工制作提示提高34.6%，在未见任务场景中仍保持36.6%的成功率。

Conclusion: 激活值与攻击效果存在相关性，语义模式在转移性漏洞利用中发挥关键作用，提出的框架有效提升了黑盒攻击的转移性。

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架为组织采用LLM时的对齐问题提供了理论基础和实用指导，填补了现有研究的空白

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

TL;DR: DeepGraphLog是一个新型神经符号AI框架，通过图神经网络谓词扩展ProbLog，支持多层神经符号推理，能够处理图结构数据中的复杂关系依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理在前、符号推理在后的流程，无法处理复杂依赖关系，特别是在图等不规则数据结构中表现受限。

Method: 扩展ProbLog并引入图神经网络谓词，将符号表示视为图，允许神经和符号组件以任意顺序分层，支持图神经网络处理符号推理。

Result: 在规划、知识图谱补全和GNN表达能力等任务上验证了DeepGraphLog的有效性，能够捕获复杂关系依赖，克服现有神经符号系统的关键限制。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更表达性和灵活的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时容易生成错误内容，现有自我纠正方法存在两个根本局限：缺乏可靠的错误定位信号，以及受限于传统next-token解码的浅层推理

Method: 提出Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架，仅在收到负反馈时激活响应再生；引入Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码，通过延迟序列评估实现多路径推理探索

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，该框架相比最先进的基于提示的自我纠错方法取得了持续且显著的改进

Conclusion: FTR框架通过结合用户反馈和增强解码机制，有效解决了大语言模型自我纠错中的关键挑战，为提升模型推理可靠性提供了新思路

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

TL;DR: RIMO是一个新的数学奥林匹克竞赛基准测试，包含两个轨道：RIMO-N（335个整数答案问题）和RIMO-P（456个证明问题），旨在消除评估噪声并提供精确的性能测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奥林匹克级别基准测试存在评分噪声和潜在偏见问题，如异构答案格式需要模型判断、依赖可能有缺陷的解决方案等，需要更精确的评估方法。

Method: 设计两轨道基准：RIMO-N将IMO问题重写为单一整数答案，支持确定性正确性检查；RIMO-P提供专家验证的证明问题，分解为子问题序列，通过自动化评分系统评估逐步推理过程。

Result: 对10个前沿LLM（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Flash）的测试显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现优异，但在RIMO上性能急剧下降，揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥林匹克级推理之间的巨大差距。

Conclusion: RIMO提供了一个具有挑战性且易于评估的测试套件，为未来研究提供了高分辨率的标准，揭示了需要解决的深刻推理差距。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型(LRLMs)在解决复杂任务时使用固定的推理token预算，缺乏对推理充分性的自适应判断，需要一种能动态调整推理深度的方法

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用批判模型定期评估自身推理置信度，达到目标置信阈值则终止，否则继续推理，实现自适应推理控制

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高基线准确率的同时减少token使用；64次多种子评估显示稳定性提升，方差降低；可节省数百万token

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有效信号，CGR方法使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信性和资源效率，为实际部署提供可行方案

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: CP-Model-Zoo是一个基于专家编写的模型数据库的辅导系统，能够根据用户自然语言描述检索最接近的组合问题源代码模型，无需人工数据标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程及其高级建模语言虽然具有强大的问题解决潜力，但由于建模语言复杂、全局约束众多以及建模技巧要求高，阻碍了非专家用户选择CP来解决组合问题。

Method: 利用多年积累的专家编写模型构建数据库，通过用户自然语言描述检索最接近的源代码模型，确保提供经过专家验证的模型，同时无需人工数据标注。

Result: 实验显示，基于不同专业水平的用户输入问题描述，系统在检索正确模型方面表现出色准确率。

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo系统通过利用现有专家模型资源，有效降低了非专家用户使用约束编程的门槛，为组合问题求解提供了实用的辅助工具。

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

TL;DR: HiPhO是首个专门针对高中物理奥林匹克竞赛的基准测试，提供人类对齐的评估，包含13个最新竞赛试题、专业评分标准和与人类选手的直接比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准测试缺乏对真实物理竞赛（如物理奥林匹克）的系统覆盖，且无法实现与人类选手的直接性能比较。

Method: 收集13个2024-2025年国际和地区奥林匹克竞赛试题，采用官方评分标准进行细粒度评分，基于奖牌阈值将模型与人类选手对比。

Result: 开源MLLM大多处于铜牌水平；开源LLM有进步但偶尔获金牌；闭源推理MLLM可获得6-12枚金牌；所有模型与满分仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在显著性能差距，闭源推理模型展现强大物理推理能力，物理推理仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了测量语言模型神福感的实验方法，通过比较言语报告咊行为表现来验证偏好满足度作为神福感代理指标的可行性


<details>

Motivation: 探索如何在人工智能系统中实验性地测量神福感，解决语言模型神福状态评估的挑战

Method: 开发新的实验范式，比较模型的言语偏好报告与虚拟环境中的行为表现，测试成本和奖励影响，验证神福量表在语义等价提示下的一致性

Result: 观察到说明的偏好与行为之间存在可靠相关性，偏好满足度可以作为神福感的实证测量代理指标，但不同模型咊条件下一致性存在差异，并且对提示变化敏感

Conclusion: 虽然不确定是否成功测量了语言模型的神福状态，但这些发现高亮了在语言模型中进行神福测量的可行性，引领了进一步探索

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过使用LLM生成反事实样本、针对性GNN训练和图解释性方法，有效减少虚假相关性，显著提升漏洞检测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的漏洞检测方法存在训练数据不平衡和标签噪声问题，容易学习到虚假的代码相似性相关性，导致在真实数据上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出VISION框架：1）使用大语言模型生成语义最小修改但标签相反的反事实样本；2）在成对的正反例代码上进行针对性GNN训练；3）基于图的解释性方法识别关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测上，总体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，成对对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION通过反事实训练有效减少了虚假学习，实现了更鲁棒和可泛化的漏洞检测，并发布了CWE-20-CFA基准数据集，推动了透明可信的AI网络安全系统发展。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Motivation: 解决缬羊优化算法(GOA)在探索与利用不平衡、群体内信息交换不充分等缺陷，提高算法在复杂问题中的优化能力和效率。

Method: 采用迭代基于的更新框架切换探索与利用阶段，使用两种自适应参数调整策略促进优化过程平滑，通过优势群体重启策略提高避免局部最优的能力。

Result: 在CEC2017和CEC2022测试集上，MSIGOA在92.2%和83.3%的函数上不比GOA差，在88.57%和87.5%的函数上不比其他先进算法差，工程设计优化问题也验证了其扩展性。

Conclusion: MSIGOA通过多策略改进有效提升了缬羊优化算法的性能，在收敛速度、稳定性和解决复杂问题能力方面都显著优于原算法和其他先进算法。

Abstract: Aiming at the shortcomings of the gazelle optimization algorithm, such as the
imbalance between exploration and exploitation and the insufficient information
exchange within the population, this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved
gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA). To address these issues, MSIGOA
proposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between
exploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which
effectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global
exploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two
adaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm
and promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based
restart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima
and avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve
the exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior
convergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the
parameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the
proposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and
CEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic
GOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the
proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%,
respectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than
other algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively. Finally, the extensibility
of MSIGAO is further verified by several engineering design optimization
problems.

TL;DR: 本文挖成传统的前向传播与反向传播对称性要求，证明激活函数的精确梯度大小并非必需，保持梯度方向即可。通过实验验证了使用简化或随机梯度替代响的可行性，拓展了激活函数的设计灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度基于的神经网络训练强制要求前向传播与反向传播对称，这严格限制了激活函数的选择，特别排除了具有显著平坦或非可微区域的函数。本文挖成这一偏见，以扩大激活函数的设计灵活性和计算效率。

Method: 通过数学分析证明精确梯度大小的多余性，只需保持梯度方向。在MLP、CNN和BNN等基础架构上进行实验，用简单或随机梯度替代传统梯度，包括使用平坦或非可微激活函数如Heaviside函数。

Result: 实验结果表明，放宽前向-反向对称性要求并不影响学习效果，反而可能提高训练稳定性和效率。网络能够有效训练并获得良好性能。

Conclusion: 本文成功挖成了前向-反向对称性的传统偏见，为激活函数设计提供了更大灵活性。这一发现有望提升神经网络的计算效率和训练稳定性，为更复杂架构的应用投下基础。

Abstract: Gradient-based neural network training traditionally enforces symmetry
between forward and backward propagation, requiring activation functions to be
differentiable (or sub-differentiable) and strictly monotonic in certain
regions to prevent flat gradient areas. This symmetry, linking forward
activations closely to backward gradients, significantly restricts the
selection of activation functions, particularly excluding those with
substantial flat or non-differentiable regions. In this paper, we challenge
this assumption through mathematical analysis, demonstrating that precise
gradient magnitudes derived from activation functions are largely redundant,
provided the gradient direction is preserved. Empirical experiments conducted
on foundational architectures - such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) -
confirm that relaxing forward-backward symmetry and substituting traditional
gradients with simpler or stochastic alternatives does not impair learning and
may even enhance training stability and efficiency. We explicitly demonstrate
that neural networks with flat or non-differentiable activation functions, such
as the Heaviside step function, can be effectively trained, thereby expanding
design flexibility and computational efficiency. Further empirical validation
with more complex architectures remains a valuable direction for future
research.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer a promising path toward energy-efficient,

word vectors into spike-based attractor states using Poisson processes. Using
BitNet b1.58 quantization, we maintain 97% semantic similarity of continuous
embeddings on SimLex-999 while achieving 100% reconstruction accuracy on 10,000
words from OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large. We preserve analogy performance
(100% of original embedding performance) even under intentionally introduced
noise, indicating a resilient mechanism for semantic encoding in neuromorphic
systems. Next steps include integrating the mapping with spiking transformers
and liquid state machines (resembling Hopfield Networks) for further
evaluation.

Abstract: With the evolution of new manufacturing technologies such as multi-material

manufactured from one single solid material. We aim at questioning five decades
of traditional paradigms in geometric CAD and focus at new generation of CAD
objects that are not solid, but contain heterogeneous free-form internal
microstructures. We propose a unified manufacturing pipeline that involves all
stages, namely design, optimization, manufacturing, and inspection of
microstructured free-form geometries. We demonstrate our pipeline on an
industrial test case of a blisk blade that sustains the desired pressure

Motivation: 现有的图像评估指标（如FID、LPIPS、CLIPScore）无法满足SVG图像的符号性和矢量性特性，需要专门针对SVG的评估标准。

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少不必要的剪切操作和支持并行计算，显著提高了剪切克罗纳余图的计算效率，具有强大的应用潜力

Abstract: Since the Voronoi diagram appears in many applications, the topic of
improving its computational efficiency remains attractive. We propose a novel
yet efficient method to compute Voronoi diagrams bounded by a given domain,
i.e., the clipped or restricted Voronoi diagrams. The intersection of the
domain and a Voronoi cell (domain-cell intersection) is generated by removing
the part outside the cell from the domain, which can be accomplished by several
clippings. Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search
scheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is
first set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.
Then, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will
launch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside
the corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be
found by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only
involves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great
advantage over the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, because each
domain-cell intersection can be generated independently, we extend the proposed
method to the GPUs for computing Voronoi diagrams in parallel. The experimental
results show the best performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art
ones, regardless of site distribution. This paper was first submitted to
SIGGRAPH Asia 2025.

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

Motivation: 解决动态场景中拓扑变化和长程跟踪的根本挑战，为六自由度虚拟环境提供沉浸式体验。

Method: 使用稀疏运动高斯表示场景运动，通过时空跟踪器和光度线索更新；每个运动高斯锚定一组局部外观高斯，通过激活机制实现高效纹理建模；引入全局高斯查找表支持压缩。

Conclusion: TaoGS为拓扑变化下的可扩展体积视频提供了统一的适应性解决方案，实现了运动中的优雅和静止中的力量的和谐统一。

Abstract: Volumetric video is emerging as a key medium for digitizing the dynamic
physical world, creating the virtual environments with six degrees of freedom
to deliver immersive user experiences. However, robustly modeling general
dynamic scenes, especially those involving topological changes while
maintaining long-term tracking remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we present TaoGS, a novel topology-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that
disentangles motion and appearance to support, both, long-range tracking and
topological adaptation. We represent scene motion with a sparse set of motion
Gaussians, which are continuously updated by a spatio-temporal tracker and
photometric cues that detect structural variations across frames. To capture
fine-grained texture, each motion Gaussian anchors and dynamically activates a
set of local appearance Gaussians, which are non-rigidly warped to the current
frame to provide strong initialization and significantly reduce training time.
This activation mechanism enables efficient modeling of detailed textures and
maintains temporal coherence, allowing high-fidelity rendering even under
challenging scenarios such as changing clothes. To enable seamless integration
into codec-based volumetric formats, we introduce a global Gaussian Lookup
Table that records the lifespan of each Gaussian and organizes attributes into
a lifespan-aware 2D layout. This structure aligns naturally with standard video
codecs and supports up to 40 compression. TaoGS provides a unified, adaptive
solution for scalable volumetric video under topological variation, capturing
moments where "elegance in motion" and "Power in Stillness", delivering
immersive experiences that harmonize with the physical world.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 通过显式能量序列条件化模型，实现了用户可驱动的唱歌声音合成中音量动态控制，在保持音频质量的同时大幅提升了控制精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前唱歌声音合成系统多依赖概率模型，对音量动态等属性缺乏精确控制能力，而音量动态变化对音乐表现力至关重要

Method: 使用从真实语音谱中提取的能量序列显式条件化SVS模型，减少注释成本；提出音素级能量序列方案使用户控制更友好

Result: 实验结果显示，与基线模型和能量预测器模型相比，在音素级输入下能量序列的均宝绝对误差减少超过50%，且不影响合成质量

Conclusion: 这是SVS领域首次实现用户可驱动的音量动态控制，通过显式能量条件化有效提升了系统的可控制性

Abstract: Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive
singing voices reflecting user intent. While recent SVS systems achieve high
audio quality, most rely on probabilistic modeling, limiting precise control
over attributes such as dynamics. We address this by focusing on dynamic
control--temporal loudness variation essential for musical expressiveness--and
explicitly condition the SVS model on energy sequences extracted from
ground-truth spectrograms, reducing annotation costs and improving
controllability. We also propose a phoneme-level energy sequence for
user-friendly control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
enabling user-driven dynamics control in SVS. Experiments show our method
achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for
phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, without
compromising synthesis quality.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了多种轻量级神经网络架构在MCU上的关键词检测性能，提出了基于MobileNet的TKWS架构，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了内存占用，并强调了特征提取参数和硬件优化的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌入式设备和IoT设备对内存和能耗有严格限制，需要开发高效的AI模型来实现免提交互。现有研究主要关注模型推理，而忽略了整个处理流程的优化。

Method: 提出了基于MobileNet的TKWS架构，系统评估了DS-CNN、LiCoNet、TENet等多种轻量级网络，涵盖了从MFCC特征提取到神经网络推理的完整处理流程，并在三个STM32平台上进行基准测试。

Result: TKWS仅用14.4k参数就达到了92.4%的F1分数，显著减少了内存占用。集成神经加速的N6 MCU实现了最佳能耗延迟乘积，支持高分辨率特征下的高效低延迟操作。

Conclusion: 模型精度不是决定实际效果的唯一因素，最优的关键词检测部署需要仔细考虑特征提取参数和硬件特定的优化策略。

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key enabling technology for hands-free
interaction in embedded and IoT devices, where stringent memory and energy
constraints challenge the deployment of AI-enabeld devices. In this work, we
systematically evaluate and compare several state-of-the-art lightweight neural
network architectures, including DS-CNN, LiCoNet, and TENet, alongside our
proposed Typman-KWS (TKWS) architecture built upon MobileNet, specifically
designed for efficient KWS on microcontroller units (MCUs). Unlike prior
studies focused solely on model inference, our analysis encompasses the entire
processing pipeline, from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) feature
extraction to neural inference, and is benchmarked across three STM32 platforms
(N6, H7, and U5). Our results show that TKWS with three residual blocks
achieves up to 92.4% F1-score with only 14.4k parameters, reducing memory
footprint without compromising the accuracy. Moreover, the N6 MCU with
integrated neural acceleration achieves the best energy-delay product (EDP),
enabling efficient, low-latency operation even with high-resolution features.
Our findings highlight the model accuracy alone does not determine real-world
effectiveness; rather, optimal keyword spotting deployments require careful
consideration of feature extraction parameters and hardware-specific
optimization.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

### [253] [When Fine-Tuning is Not Enough: Lessons from HSAD on Hybrid and Adversarial Audio Spoof Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07323)
*Bin Hu,Kunyang Huang,Daehan Kwak,Meng Xu,Kuan Huang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了混合欺骗音频数据集HSAD，包含4类音频样本，评估了多种transformer模型在混合语音欺骗检测中的表现，发现预训练模型在混合条件下表现不佳，而数据集特定适配能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音欺骗检测大多处理二分类问题，但现实攻击常包含混合真实和合成语音的混合音频，检测更具挑战性，需要专门的数据集和评估框架。

Method: 创建HSAD数据集（包含41,044个退化语音样本），评估6种基于transformer的模型（包括频谱图编码器和自监督波形模型），分析模型在混合音频检测中的表现。

Result: 预训练模型在混合条件下过度泛化且性能崩溃；欺骗特定微调可改善可分性但难以处理未见组合；HSAD数据集适配使AST模型准确率超过97%，F1分数约99%，但对复杂混合音频仍存在残留错误。

Conclusion: 仅靠微调不足够，需要像HSAD这样的混合感知基准来暴露校准失败和模型偏差，为构建鲁棒可信的语音认证系统提供数据集和分析框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has enabled highly realistic speech synthesis and
voice cloning, posing serious risks to voice authentication, smart assistants,
and telecom security. While most prior work frames spoof detection as a binary
task, real-world attacks often involve hybrid utterances that mix genuine and
synthetic speech, making detection substantially more challenging. To address
this gap, we introduce the Hybrid Spoofed Audio Dataset (HSAD), a benchmark
containing 1,248 clean and 41,044 degraded utterances across four classes:
human, cloned, zero-shot AI-generated, and hybrid audio. Each sample is
annotated with spoofing method, speaker identity, and degradation metadata to
enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate six transformer-based models,
including spectrogram encoders (MIT-AST, MattyB95-AST) and self-supervised
waveform models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT). Results reveal critical lessons: pretrained
models overgeneralize and collapse under hybrid conditions; spoof-specific
fine-tuning improves separability but struggles with unseen compositions; and
dataset-specific adaptation on HSAD yields large performance gains (AST greater
than 97 percent and F1 score is approximately 99 percent), though residual
errors persist for complex hybrids. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuning
alone is not sufficient-robust hybrid-aware benchmarks like HSAD are essential
to expose calibration failures, model biases, and factors affecting spoof
detection in adversarial environments. HSAD thus provides both a dataset and an
analytic framework for building resilient and trustworthy voice authentication
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的细粒度面部属性建模方法，通过分解面部图像并渐进整合多粒度表示，结合多任务学习和多视角训练策略，显著提升了面部到语音合成的质量和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对中风等创伤患者无法说话的问题，现有文本转语音技术无法保留用户原声。面部到语音合成虽有望解决此问题，但现有方法依赖预训练视觉编码器，丢失了性别、种族等与声音特征相关的细粒度信息，且多阶段训练效率低下。

Method: 1）将面部图像分解为不重叠片段并渐进整合为多粒度表示；2）在视觉和声学域进行性别和种族等说话人属性的多任务学习；3）采用多视角训练策略，将不同角度和光照条件下的面部图像与相同语音配对。

Result: 通过主客观评估验证，该方法显著提升了面部-语音一致性和合成稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度面部属性建模和多视角训练方法有效解决了现有面部到语音合成中的信息丢失和训练效率问题，为创伤患者的语音恢复提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: For individuals who have experienced traumatic events such as strokes, speech
may no longer be a viable means of communication. While text-to-speech (TTS)
can be used as a communication aid since it generates synthetic speech, it
fails to preserve the user's own voice. As such, face-to-voice (FTV) synthesis,
which derives corresponding voices from facial images, provides a promising
alternative. However, existing methods rely on pre-trained visual encoders, and
finetune them to align with speech embeddings, which strips fine-grained
information from facial inputs such as gender or ethnicity, despite their known
correlation with vocal traits. Moreover, these pipelines are multi-stage, which
requires separate training of multiple components, thus leading to training
inefficiency. To address these limitations, we utilize fine-grained facial
attribute modeling by decomposing facial images into non-overlapping segments
and progressively integrating them into a multi-granular representation. This
representation is further refined through multi-task learning of speaker
attributes such as gender and ethnicity at both the visual and acoustic
domains. Moreover, to improve alignment robustness, we adopt a multi-view
training strategy by pairing various visual perspectives of a speaker in terms
of different angles and lighting conditions, with identical speech recordings.
Extensive subjective and objective evaluations confirm that our approach
substantially enhances face-voice congruence and synthesis stability.

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的调度设计和网络架构，有效解决了现有生成模型的限制，在语音增强任务中展示了优异的性能。

Abstract: The design of mean and variance schedules for the perturbed signal is a
fundamental challenge in generative models. While score-based and Schr\"odinger
bridge-based models require careful selection of the stochastic differential
equation to derive the corresponding schedules, flow-based models address this
issue via vector field matching. However, this strategy often leads to
hallucination artifacts and inefficient training and inference processes due to
the potential inclusion of stochastic components in the vector field.
Additionally, the widely adopted diffusion backbone, NCSN++, suffers from high
computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
target-based generative framework that enhances both the flexibility of
mean/variance schedule design and the efficiency of training and inference
processes. Specifically, we eliminate the stochastic components in the training
loss by reformulating the generative speech enhancement task as a target signal
estimation problem, which therefore leads to more stable and efficient training
and inference processes. In addition, we employ a logistic mean schedule and a
bridge variance schedule, which yield a more favorable signal-to-noise ratio
trajectory compared to several widely used schedules and thus leads to a more
efficient perturbation strategy. Furthermore, we propose a new diffusion
backbone for audio, which significantly improves the efficiency over NCSN++ by
explicitly modeling long-term frame correlations and cross-band dependencies.

TL;DR: Falcon3-Audio是一个高效的音频-语言模型家族，仅用不到3万小时公开音频数据就达到了与更大模型相当的性能，证明了数据效率和训练简化的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管音频在人类交流中至关重要，但大语言模型与音频的整合仍未被充分探索。研究旨在开发高效的音频-语言模型，减少对大量数据和复杂训练策略的依赖。

Method: 基于指令调优的LLM和Whisper编码器构建Falcon3-Audio模型家族，使用单阶段训练，仅需少量公开音频数据（<30K小时），避免了课程学习、多编码器和复杂交叉注意力连接器等复杂设计。

Result: Falcon3-Audio-7B在MMAU基准测试中获得64.14分，与R1-AQA性能相当，同时在数据和参数效率、训练透明度和单阶段训练方面表现优异。最小的1B模型也能与2B-13B参数的开源模型竞争。

Conclusion: 研究表明，常见复杂训练策略并非必要，即使相比使用50万小时数据训练的模型，简单高效的架构设计也能实现强大的音频-语言理解性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with
audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human
communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models
(ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably
small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) --
Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum
learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors --
are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on
over 500K hours of data.

Abstract: Deep learning appears as an appealing solution for Automatic Synthesizer
Programming (ASP), which aims to assist musicians and sound designers in
programming sound synthesizers. However, integrating software synthesizers into
training pipelines is challenging due to their potential non-differentiability.
This work tackles this challenge by introducing a method to approximate
arbitrary synthesizers. Specifically, we train a neural network to map
synthesizer presets onto an audio embedding space derived from a pretrained
model. This facilitates the definition of a neural proxy that produces compact
yet effective representations, thereby enabling the integration of audio
embedding loss into neural-based ASP systems for black-box synthesizers. We
evaluate the representations derived by various pretrained audio models in the
context of neural-based nASP and assess the effectiveness of several neural
network architectures, including feedforward, recurrent, and transformer-based
models, in defining neural proxies. We evaluate the proposed method using both
synthetic and hand-crafted presets from three popular software synthesizers and
assess its performance in a synthesizer sound matching downstream task. While
the benefits of the learned representation are nuanced by resource
requirements, encouraging results were obtained for all synthesizers, paving
the way for future research into the application of synthesizer proxies for
neural-based ASP systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SMIA的新型对抗攻击方法，通过操纵AI生成音频中人耳无法感知的频率区域，成功欺骗了语音认证系统和反欺骗措施，攻击成功率高达82-100%，揭示了当前安全防御的严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音认证系统虽然采用深度学习技术不断改进，但仍面临深度伪造和对抗攻击等严重漏洞。现有的反欺骗措施多依赖静态检测模型，容易被新型对抗方法绕过，存在关键安全缺口。

Method: 提出了频谱掩蔽和插值攻击(SMIA)方法，策略性地操纵AI生成音频中人耳无法感知的频率区域，创建听起来真实但能欺骗检测系统的对抗样本。

Result: SMIA在模拟真实环境下的综合评估中表现优异：对组合VAS/CM系统的攻击成功率达82%以上，对独立说话人验证系统达97.5%以上，对反欺骗措施达到100%的成功率。

Conclusion: 当前安全防御姿态不足以应对自适应对抗攻击，迫切需要向下一代防御范式转变，采用能够随威胁环境演变的动态、上下文感知框架。

Abstract: Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) use unique vocal characteristics for
verification. They are increasingly integrated into high-security sectors such
as banking and healthcare. Despite their improvements using deep learning, they
face severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and
adversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates
detection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio.
While anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many
rely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial
methods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we
propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method
that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated
audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA
creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions.
SMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against
combined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification
systems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively
demonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive
adversarial attacks. This work highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift
toward next-generation defenses that employ dynamic, context-aware frameworks
capable of evolving with the threat landscape.

Conclusion: 对于深度卷积神经网络音频分类任务，梅尔谱图和MFCC是最有效的特征表示方法，其性能显著超过其他研究的谱和节奏特征

Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains
like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various
spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input
data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm
features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000
labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning
pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for
multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then
the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio
classification tasks using deep CNNs.
