A key challenge in managing and securing these\ndevices is accurate identification and classification. To address this\nchallenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a\npromising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of\nidentifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner.\nThis research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum\nanalysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from\nRF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample\ncontaining 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples\nacross the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling\nframework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning\nmethods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for\nlearning the identification of RF devices based on their transient\ncharacteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation\nperformance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%,\nand classification accuracy of 99.17%.

A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks.
