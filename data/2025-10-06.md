### [1] [FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691)
*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从自由稀疏图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强场景优化，解决了传统方法需要密集校准视图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯溅射方法需要密集校准视图，而从自由稀疏图像重建往往由于有限重叠和过拟合导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用贡献度剪枝消除局部漂浮物，利用深度和多视图特征监督缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从自由稀疏图像实现高质量表面重建，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

### [3] [ROGR: Relightable 3D Objects using Generative Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03163)
*Jiapeng Tang,Matthew Lavine,Dor Verbin,Stephan J. Garbin,Matthias Nießner,Ricardo Martin Brualla,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Philipp Henzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROGR是一种新颖的可重光照3D重建方法，使用生成式重光照模型从多视角图像中重建物体，并通过双分支架构的NeRF实现任意环境光照下的高效前向重光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D重建方法在重光照方面存在局限性，需要针对每种光照进行优化或进行复杂的光传输模拟。ROGR旨在实现无需逐光照优化或光传输模拟的高效重光照。

Method: 通过在不同光照环境下采样物体外观创建数据集，训练光照条件神经辐射场(NeRF)。采用新颖的双分支架构分别编码一般光照效果和镜面反射，实现任意环境贴图下的前向重光照。

Result: 在TensoIR和Stanford-ORB数据集上评估，在大多数指标上优于现有最先进方法，并在真实世界物体捕捉上展示了良好效果。

Conclusion: ROGR提供了一种高效的可重光照3D重建解决方案，通过双分支NeRF架构实现了无需逐光照优化的任意环境光照重光照能力。

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

### [4] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用Oracle排序器替代训练奖励模型，结合基于排名的GRPO_rank损失函数，在视频理解任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集人类反馈的成本增加；现有RLAIF框架依赖训练专门的奖励模型，流程昂贵且受限。

Method: 使用Oracle排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非打分，提出基于排名的GRPO_rank损失函数直接优化序数反馈。

Result: Oracle-RLAIF在各种视频理解基准测试中持续优于领先的视频语言模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为大型多模态视频模型的对齐提供了灵活且数据高效的强化学习路径，基于排名而非分数。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Conclusion: 人类和机器在确保准确面部识别中都具有重要意义，智能人机协作是实现高精度面部识别系统的有效途径。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个视频生成模型不确定性量化框架S-QUBED，包含校准评估指标、黑盒UQ方法和基准数据集，能够分解预测不确定性为偶然性和认知性成分。

Result: 在基准视频数据集上的实验表明，S-QUBED能够计算与任务准确度负相关的校准总不确定性估计，并有效分解偶然性和认知性不确定性成分。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对视频生成模型的不确定性量化工作，提出的S-QUBED框架能够可靠地量化视频模型的不确定性，为视频生成系统的安全部署提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [8] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)方法，通过优化文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型的生成图像美学质量，无需训练且与主干模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示词下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，希望通过优化文本嵌入来改善生成效果。

Method: 使用预训练扩散模型作为主干，通过三目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升美学保真度、确保与优化嵌入的一致性、最小化与初始提示的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明该方法有效，在性能上超过或等同于最先进的文本到图像和提示适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO方法能够有效提升简单提示词下生成图像的美学质量，且具有无需训练和主干模型无关的优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型无标记多相机系统，用于在真实野外条件下捕获精确的3D手部和物体数据，解决了现有数据集在环境多样性和模型泛化方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手部跟踪数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，限制了环境多样性并影响模型泛化能力，需要开发能够在真实野外条件下进行精确3D手部跟踪的方法。

Method: 设计了一种轻量级背戴式捕捉系统，包含8个外中心相机和Meta Quest 3头显提供的2个自我中心视角，开发了自我-外中心跟踪流程来生成准确的3D手部姿态真值。

Result: 通过收集包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿态的标注数据集，证明了该方法能够显著减少环境真实性与3D标注精度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该无标记多相机系统能够在真实野外条件下实现精确的3D手部跟踪，为计算机视觉研究提供了更真实和多样化的数据基础。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频蒸馏方法，通过输入人体姿态条件引导注意力和损失函数，将多步扩散视频模型蒸馏为少步学生模型，实现实时性能并提升视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法由于大量去噪步骤和昂贵的注意力机制导致速度慢，无法实现实时部署

Method: 利用输入人体姿态关键点的准确对应关系指导注意力到相关区域（如说话者的面部、手部和上半身），提出输入感知稀疏注意力和输入感知蒸馏损失

Result: 实现了实时性能，与最近的音频驱动和输入驱动方法相比视觉质量有所提升

Conclusion: 通过集成输入感知稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，在保持视觉质量的同时显著提高了推理效率

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [11] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FunLoRA的新方法，通过使用仅包含秩1矩阵的低秩适应机制来缓解生成模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需依赖合成数据重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型在持续适应过程中面临灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法依赖合成数据重训练会导致训练时间不可控和长期性能下降。

Method: 设计基于低秩适应(LoRA)的功能性条件机制FunLoRA，使用秩1矩阵并通过精心选择的函数增加重参数化矩阵的秩，实现动态条件化。

Result: 实验表明FunLoRA在基于流匹配的模型上超越了基于扩散模型的现有最优结果，达到更高分类准确率，同时仅需少量内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA方法能有效避免灾难性遗忘，只需在当前任务数据上训练，在参数效率和性能方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到有声视频生成中的两个关键挑战：单一共享文本标题导致的模态干扰，以及跨模态特征交互机制不明确的问题。

Method: 提出分层视觉基础字幕框架生成解耦的视频和音频字幕，并设计BridgeDiT双塔扩散变换器，采用双交叉注意力机制实现双向信息交换。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在大多数指标上达到了最先进水平，人类评估也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来文本到有声视频生成任务提供了关键见解，代码和检查点将公开发布。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个双视场、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，通过统一的三层防御堆栈（特征压缩、防御蒸馏、基于熵的异常检测）结合时序投票，显著提升模型对数字和自然扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全。现有方法缺乏对时间连续性、多静态视场感知以及对数字和自然退化鲁棒性的考虑。

Method: 基于aiMotive、Udacity、Waymo和自录德克萨斯视频构建多源数据集，对高速公路、夜间、雨天和城市四种操作设计域进行时序对齐。采用统一三层防御堆栈框架，包含特征压缩、防御蒸馏和基于熵的异常检测，并结合序列时序投票增强。

Result: 统一防御堆栈达到79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，同时将高风险误分类降至32%。通过重捕获探针确认物理可转移性。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了交通灯和标志识别系统对对抗攻击和自然扰动的鲁棒性，为自动驾驶安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

TL;DR: MoGIC是一个统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过整合意图建模和视觉先验，解决了现有方法在捕捉动作执行因果逻辑和人类意图方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法将合成视为语言和运动之间的双向映射，但在捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑和驱动行为的人类意图方面仍有局限。缺乏视觉基础进一步限制了精度和个性化。

Method: 提出MoGIC框架，通过联合优化多模态条件运动生成和意图预测，揭示潜在的人类目标，利用视觉先验增强生成。引入具有自适应范围的注意力混合机制，实现条件标记和运动子序列之间的有效局部对齐。

Result: 在HumanML3D上FID降低38.6%，在Mo440H上降低34.6%，在运动字幕生成方面超越基于LLM的方法，并进一步实现意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC推进了可控运动合成和意图理解，展示了统一多模态生成框架的优势。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于运动自适应的动态3D重建框架，通过语义和运动先验优化控制点分配，解决现有方法中静态冗余和动态不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏控制方法仅基于几何分配控制点，导致静态区域冗余和动态区域不足，无法有效处理运动复杂度的变化

Method: 利用视觉基础模型的语义和运动先验，建立patch-token-node对应关系，通过运动自适应压缩在动态区域集中控制点；引入样条轨迹参数化替代MLP变形场

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面相比现有最先进方法有显著提升

Conclusion: 运动自适应框架通过控制点密度与运动复杂度对齐，有效解决了动态3D重建中的核心挑战

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，难以处理真实噪声复杂性；深度学习方法需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。需要一种能结合两者优势的方法来处理真实世界噪声。

Method: 提出Net2Net混合框架，结合无监督深度图像先验(DIP)和监督预训练模型DRUNet，通过去噪正则化(RED)进行集成。无监督网络适应输入图像的独特噪声特征，预训练网络利用大规模数据集学习表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面表现出优越性能，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: Net2Net通过结合无监督和监督网络的混合方法，有效解决了真实世界噪声去除的挑战，提高了跨不同噪声模式的泛化能力。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过引入信息压缩模块和新的训练范式，解决了DeepSeek-R1方法直接应用于检索任务时的高计算成本和训练不稳定性问题，实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了RL增强LLM推理能力的巨大潜力，但直接将其方法应用于检索任务不可行，主要因为：(1)多候选推理过程导致的高计算成本；(2)直接应用RL训练检索任务的不稳定性和次优结果。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制，减少token数量同时保留关键信息；提出新的训练范式，包括使用检索定制合成CoT数据集的激活阶段，以及采用课程奖励的RL训练。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中展现出SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过信息压缩和新的训练范式设计，Retrv-R1成功解决了R1方法在检索任务中的应用挑战，为多模态通用检索提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Motivation: 现有的测试时适应方法要么依赖计算昂贵的反向传播，要么只关注似然适应而忽略了先验的重要性。BCA+旨在解决这些问题，为对象识别和检测提供统一的训练免费适应框架。

Method: 引入动态缓存机制，自适应存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度（用于检测）以及自适应类别先验。将适应问题建模为贝叶斯推理，通过融合初始VLM输出和基于缓存的预测来生成最终预测。

Conclusion: BCA+通过双适应机制和不确定性引导融合，能够同时校正模型的语义理解和上下文置信度，为视觉语言模型在真实世界分布偏移下的性能提供了有效的测试时适应解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于脑肿瘤分类的层次化广义类别发现方法（HGCD-BT），通过结合层次聚类和对比学习，能够识别训练时未见过的肿瘤类别，在OpenSRH数据集上比现有GCD方法准确率提升28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义的固定类别，无法识别训练时未见的肿瘤类型。无监督学习缺乏利用标注数据先验知识的能力，而半监督方法通常假设所有潜在类别都在标注数据中。广义类别发现（GCD）旨在解决这一问题，但需要适应脑肿瘤分类的层次化结构。

Method: HGCD-BT方法将层次聚类与对比学习相结合，在基于对比学习的GCD基础上引入半监督层次聚类损失函数，能够捕获脑肿瘤分类的层次化结构。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，HGCD-BT在斑块级别分类中比最先进的GCD方法准确率提升28%，特别是在识别未见过的肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在Digital Brain Tumor Atlas的H&E染色全玻片图像上验证了方法的跨模态泛化能力。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT方法能够有效识别已知和未知的脑肿瘤类别，适应层次化分类结构，并在不同成像模态上展现出良好的泛化性能，为神经肿瘤手术中的术中决策提供了更准确的分类工具。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中存在关键时刻遗漏和短时细粒度线索丢失的问题，均匀采样和固定时间间隔策略效果有限，需要更好的关键帧选择方法。

Method: 提出统一的RD-MV目标函数，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件，使用轻量级相关性感知门控机制处理弱对齐情况。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key提供了一种无需训练、即插即用的高效关键帧采样解决方案，显著提升了长视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但它们在复杂横向思维挑战（如字谜）中的认知过程仍不透明，且失败模式未被充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别，并开发了将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架，研究了三种提示策略。

Result: 推理质量在不同谜题类别间差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现出系统性优势，但在缺失解释和文化符号理解方面存在根本性局限。

Conclusion: 提示策略显著影响认知方法和问题解决效果，可解释性应被视为模型性能的组成部分而非事后考虑。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: 为鲁棒的多模态医学目标检测提供了一条实用路径，能够产生模态感知且类别忠实的查询表示

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在视觉语言理解方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，即生成与输入视觉和文本内容相矛盾的内容。现有的对比解码方法难以构建合适的对比样本，注意力操作方法缺乏稳定性。

Method: 提出图像头掩码对比解码(MaskCD)，利用LVLMs中的"图像头"，通过掩码这些头来构建对比样本进行对比解码。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b上的评估显示，MaskCD在CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试中有效缓解了幻觉现象，同时保持了LVLMs的通用能力。

Conclusion: MaskCD是一种有效的缓解LVLMs幻觉问题的方法，通过掩码图像头构建对比样本，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Method: 将多模态医学数据视为具有质量驱动选择机制的序列帧，设计三个协作模块：PreWeightNet用于全局贡献评估、ThresholdNet用于自适应过滤、EffiWeightNet用于有效权重计算，并提出因果模态身份模块(CMIM)通过视觉语言建模建立生成图像与目标模态描述之间的因果约束。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Med-K2N方法显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过渐进增强和质量控制机制，有效解决了跨模态医学图像合成中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了灵活可靠的模态重建能力。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要准确、无损的鸡蛋质量评估方法来确保食品安全、维持产品标准和提高商业家禽生产效率。

Method: 使用预训练CNN模型提取外部图像特征，结合鸡蛋形状和重量等结构特征，通过PCA降维、SMOTE增强和多种机器学习算法分类，最后采用集成投票机制。

Result: 多模态方法显著优于仅使用图像或仅使用表格特征的基线方法，在等级分类和新鲜度预测上分别达到86.57%和70.83%的准确率。

Conclusion: 仅使用外部非侵入性特征就能有效评估鸡蛋内部质量，多模态融合方法优于单一模态，相关代码和数据集已公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

transparency, reproducibility, and further research in this domain.

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的零样本图像描述框架，从图像中心转向补丁中心范式，能够描述任意图像区域而无需区域级监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本描述模型局限于全局表示和整图描述，无法描述图像中的特定区域。

Method: 将单个图像补丁作为原子描述单元，通过聚合补丁特征来描述任意区域，从单个补丁到非连续区域和整个图像。

Result: 使用DINO等生成有意义的密集视觉特征的主干网络，在多个基于区域的描述任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示对于可扩展的描述生成非常有效，在密集描述、区域集描述和新引入的追踪描述任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

*Bing Li,Jiaxin Chen,Dongming Zhang,Xiuguo Bao,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MEACI-Net框架，通过运动增强和多模态交互改进压缩视频动作识别，解决动态信息粗糙和模态融合不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别虽然能显著降低存储和计算成本，但存在动态信息粗糙噪声大、RGB与运动模态融合不足的问题

Method: 采用双流架构，运动流使用多尺度块和去噪模块增强表示学习，通过SMC和CMA模块加强模态间交互

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试上验证了方法的有效性和效率

Conclusion: MEACI-Net通过运动增强和跨模态交互有效提升了压缩视频动作识别的性能

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型在语义分割中检测分布外区域的能力，这对于自动驾驶等安全关键应用至关重要。

Method: 使用InternImage骨干网络特征，结合K-Means聚类和置信度阈值来识别OoD聚类，无需任何异常监督或训练。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准上达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准上达到48.77，超越了多个有监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用OoD分割提供了有前景的方向，只需最少假设或额外数据。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从全局视角重新思考token保留策略，在不同空间区域自适应分配剪枝预算，解决了现有注意力优先剪枝方法在高剪枝率下性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，现有基于注意力机制的token剪枝方法倾向于保留语义相似的token，在高剪枝率下会造成性能显著下降。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，通过在不同空间区域自适应分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token能够捕捉全局视觉上下文而非孤立显著特征。

Result: 实验结果表明HoloV在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝率下均优于现有方法。例如，LLaVA1.5配备HoloV后在剪枝88.9%视觉token时仍能保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过整体视角的token剪枝策略，最小化了表示崩溃，在激进剪枝下仍能保持任务相关信息，实现了优越的效率-精度权衡。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW)方法，通过置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化来增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：(1)置信度感知损失，通过缩放干净和对抗预测之间的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本；(2)特征对齐正则化，通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离来保持语义一致性。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAW在AutoAttack等强攻击下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，同时使用更少内存。

Conclusion: CAW能够在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下同时提高干净准确率和鲁棒准确率。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型视觉语言模型在颈动脉粥样硬化疾病风险评估中的应用，通过整合超声成像与临床数据，开发了一个模拟真实诊断场景的框架，并发现领域适应和多模态整合能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样的临床和影像信息，且需对临床医生透明可解释，这是一个重大临床挑战。

Method: 提出了一个通过访谈式问题序列模拟真实诊断场景的框架，比较了多种开源大型视觉语言模型，包括通用模型和医学调优模型，并使用低秩适应( LoRA)对LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna进行超声领域适应。

Result: 零样本实验显示，并非所有LVLM都能准确识别成像模式和解剖结构，所有模型在风险分类方面表现均不佳。经过领域适应后，模型在卒中风险分层方面有显著改善，整合多模态表格数据进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率，性能可与先前在同一数据集上训练的CNN基线相媲美。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了LVLM在基于超声的心血管风险预测中的潜力和局限性，强调了多模态整合、模型校准和领域适应对于临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用深度自编码器生成器参数效率低，缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进多期相增强MRI合成中的特征分离。

Method: 使用变分自编码器将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，采用Y形双向训练策略增强特征分离的可解释性。

Result: 与现有深度自编码器方法相比，FDA-VAE显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提高合成质量。

Conclusion: FDA-VAE是一种高效的多期相增强MRI合成方法，在参数效率和合成质量方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在短提示下表现良好，但在理解和遵循长而详细的提示时存在困难，生成结果不一致。

Method: 构建包含200个平均长度超过250词的长提示基准LPG-Bench，并提出基于文本-图像-文本一致性的零样本评估指标TIT，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现方式。

Result: 实验表明TIT方法在人类偏好对齐方面优于现有指标，TIT-Score-LLM在成对准确率上比最强基线提升7.31%。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为评估和促进文本到图像模型发展提供了新视角，所有资源将公开。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3DEditVerse数据集和3DEditFormer模型，通过大规模配对数据和结构保持的Transformer架构，解决了3D编辑中的跨视图一致性和结构保真度问题，无需依赖手动3D掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D编辑任务中存在的跨视图一致性、结构保真度和细粒度控制等挑战，现有方法往往速度慢、易产生几何失真或依赖错误率高且不实用的手动3D掩码。

Method: 在数据层面构建了包含116,309个高质量训练对和1,500个测试对的3DEditVerse数据集；在模型层面提出了3DEditFormer，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控的3D结构保持条件Transformer。

Result: 通过广泛实验证明，该框架在定量和定性评估中都优于现有最先进基线，为实用和可扩展的3D编辑设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 提出的3DEditVerse数据集和3DEditFormer模型成功解决了3D编辑的关键挑战，实现了无需辅助3D掩码的精确一致编辑，推动了3D编辑技术的发展。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，在热带多云地区实用性有限，需要评估云层对土地覆盖分割的影响并开发应对方法。

Method: 开发云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖；提出轻量级方法将归一化差异指数注入解码层以保留关键空间特征；结合Sentinel-1雷达数据填补光学图像云遮挡的空白。

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，NDI注入使U-Net和DeepLabV3在无云图像上的性能分别提升1.99%和2.78%；在云覆盖条件下，结合Sentinel-1数据相比仅使用光学数据在所有模型上都取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 雷达-光学数据融合在挑战性大气条件下具有显著效果，提出的方法能有效提升云覆盖地区的土地覆盖分割性能。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event
conditioning in future models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在辐射场语义蒸馏中几何基础特征与纯视觉特征的对比，发现几何基础特征包含更多几何细节但降低了姿态估计精度，而纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索几何基础语义特征在蒸馏辐射场中的潜在优势，特别是在空间任务如姿态估计中的表现，填补了现有工作缺乏语义集成和几何基础研究的空白。

Method: 提出了SPINE框架，包含两个核心组件：使用蒸馏语义进行粗反转和使用光度优化进行精细反转，用于无需初始猜测的辐射场反转。

Result: 几何基础特征包含更精细的结构细节，但在语义目标定位任务中无显著差异，在姿态估计任务中精度反而下降。纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 纯视觉特征在通用性方面优于几何基础特征，未来需要研究更有效的几何基础策略来增强预训练语义特征的多功能性和性能。

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InsideOut是一个基于EfficientNetV2-S的可复现面部表情识别框架，通过迁移学习、数据增强和类别不平衡优化，在FER2013数据集上达到62.8%准确率和0.590宏平均F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部表情识别在情感计算中至关重要，但现有方法面临遮挡、光照变化、姿态变化、类内细微差异和数据集不平衡等挑战，特别是对少数类别表情的识别困难。

Method: 基于EfficientNetV2-S构建框架，采用迁移学习、强数据增强和分层分割，使用类别加权损失函数处理不平衡分布，微调轻量级分类头。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高效架构结合针对性的不平衡处理可以提供实用、透明且可复现的面部表情识别解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个用于交互中心视频生成的两阶段框架，无需密集掩码输入，通过预测动作轨迹来生成高质量的人机交互视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂的动态交互，而获取精确掩码标注在现实应用中具有挑战性。需要一种无需密集掩码输入但能生成高质量交互视频的方法。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段流程：首先预测执行者和对象的合理运动轨迹，然后基于这些轨迹生成视频。支持通过动作描述或空间位置线索来指导运动轨迹。

Result: 在两个涵盖人机交互和机器人操作场景的基准测试中，该方法在视觉真实性和可控性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架成功解决了交互中心视频生成的挑战，无需密集掩码输入就能实现高质量的生成效果，为具身智能提供了丰富的视觉先验。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了视觉生成模型中影响组合泛化的设计选择，发现离散vs连续训练目标和条件信息程度是关键因素，并提出通过添加连续JEPA目标来改进MaskGIT的组合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉生成模型中促进或抑制组合泛化（生成已知概念的新颖组合）的机制，目前尚未完全清楚。

Method: 通过受控实验研究不同设计选择对组合泛化的影响，并基于发现提出在MaskGIT离散损失基础上添加辅助连续JEPA目标的方法。

Result: 识别出两个关键因素：(i) 训练目标是离散还是连续分布，(ii) 条件在训练期间提供构成概念信息的程度。提出的方法能改进离散模型如MaskGIT的组合性能。

Conclusion: 训练目标的离散/连续性质和条件信息的充分程度是影响组合泛化的关键因素，通过混合离散和连续目标可以提升组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型潜在空间的图像扰动方法，通过改变去噪轨迹的起始点来生成视觉保真度高且对下游生成模型具有抵抗力的不可学习样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对文本到图像扩散模型在个性化应用中的数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用问题，现有像素空间扰动方法存在噪声和伪影问题，需要更隐蔽的防御方法。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，交替进行去噪和反转过程，修改去噪轨迹的起始点，通过轨迹偏移采样确保扰动图像既保持高视觉保真度又抵抗下游模型的逆向工程和个性化。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的验证显示，该方法在感知指标（PSNR、SSIM、FID）上提升约8%-10%，在五种对抗设置下平均鲁棒性提升约10%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将不可学习性集成到潜在扩散模型框架中，为敏感数据保护提供了实用且难以察觉的防御手段。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个基于3D几何引导的参考驱动图像补全框架，通过双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，显著提升几何一致性和补全质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机位姿或深度），导致补全内容错位或不合理，特别是在目标视图与参考图像差异较大时。

Method: 提出双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征；采用联合自注意力确保一致性；引入目标感知掩码策略，在训练时屏蔽参考图像中的遮挡区域。

Result: 实验显示GeoComplete在PSNR指标上比现有最优方法提升17.1，显著提高几何准确性的同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过整合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的两个层次区域，分别提取结构和语义特征，结合潜在扩散先验和CLIP嵌入，使用Versatile Diffusion模型合成图像，显著提升了复杂场景下脑活动重建图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重建复杂视觉刺激时面临困难，因为自然场景的低级特征具有异质性，而高级特征由于上下文重叠存在语义纠缠。受视觉皮层层次表示理论启发，需要开发能分别处理结构和语义信息的方法。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验；语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入；通过Versatile Diffusion模型整合这些组件合成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，HAVIR在复杂场景下显著提升了重建图像的结构和语义质量，性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR模型通过层次化处理视觉皮层的结构和语义信息，有效解决了复杂视觉刺激重建的挑战，为脑活动解码提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: 马尔可夫Reeb图是一个可扩展的轨迹模拟框架，在多样化城市环境中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，是导致残疾的主要原因，但AI辅助诊断因缺乏椎体级别感知的多模态数据集而受限。临床决策需要跨X光、CT和MRI在特定椎体级别进行复杂推理。

Method: 与执业脊柱外科医生共同设计，采用两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订）创建SpineMed-450k数据集，包含45万条指令实例，涵盖教科书、指南、开放数据集和约1000个医院病例。

Result: 在SpineBench上的评估显示，现有大型视觉语言模型在细粒度、椎体特定推理方面存在系统性弱点，而基于SpineMed-450k微调的模型在所有任务上均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 临床医生评估证实了该模型输出的诊断清晰度和实用性，为脊柱疾病AI辅助诊断提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Conclusion: UniShield通过多智能体统一框架有效解决了伪造图像检测和定位中的跨领域泛化问题，为维护信息完整性和社会安全提供了有力工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

the image encoder. Our method simulates realistic user interaction patterns
during training while addressing the computational challenges of learning from
sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU. For efficient training, we
initialize our network using the publicly available weights from the
nnInteractive segmentation model. Evaluation on the \textbf{Foundation Models

Motivation: 产品量化(PQ)在可扩展向量编码中表现优异，但在高保真图像生成的潜在表示中应用有限，作者希望将PQ集成到VQGAN框架中提升性能。

Method: 在VQGAN的向量量化框架中集成产品量化，深入分析码本大小、嵌入维度和子空间分解之间的相互作用，将向量和标量量化作为特例。

Result: PSNR达到37dB（之前工作为27dB），FID、LPIPS和CMMD分数降低高达96%。分析发现VQ和PQ在扩展嵌入维度时性能表现相反。

Conclusion: PQGAN展示了产品量化在图像合成中作为离散潜在表示的强大扩展能力，能够实现更快速、计算效率更高的生成，或在无额外成本下将输出分辨率提高一倍。

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了Memory Forcing学习框架，通过几何索引的空间记忆和混合训练协议，解决自回归视频扩散模型在长期空间一致性和新场景生成质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型在模拟游戏玩法时需要同时生成自然的新场景内容，并在重新访问已探索区域时保持空间一致性。现有方法在有限计算预算下面临权衡：仅使用时间记忆缺乏长期空间一致性，而添加空间记忆可能因过度依赖不充分的空间上下文而降低新场景生成质量。

Conclusion: Memory Forcing框架通过精心设计的训练协议和空间记忆机制，成功解决了自回归视频扩散模型在长期空间一致性和新场景生成质量之间的权衡，为世界建模和交互式场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏评估骨骼运动、意图文本和周围场景对齐关系的工具，尽管这种机制在人类复杂环境运动中很直观。

Method: 受高阶关系建模启发，MonSTeR利用单模态和跨模态表示构建统一潜在空间，捕捉模态间的复杂依赖关系。

Result: MonSTeR在性能上超越了仅依赖单模态表示的三模态模型，并通过用户研究验证了检索分数与人类偏好的一致性。

Conclusion: MonSTeR的潜在空间具有多功能性，在零样本场景内物体放置和运动字幕生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

### [55] [Test-Time Defense Against Adversarial Attacks via Stochastic Resonance of Latent Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03224)
*Dong Lao,Yuxiang Zhang,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Yangchao Wu,Alex Wong,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机共振的测试时防御机制，通过引入小的平移扰动来对抗对抗性攻击，无需训练、架构无关且攻击类型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖特征过滤或平滑，可能导致信息损失，需要一种既能增强鲁棒性又能最小化信息损失的方法。

Method: 对输入图像引入小的平移扰动，对齐变换后的特征嵌入，聚合后再映射回原始参考图像，采用闭式公式实现。

Result: 在图像分类上恢复高达68.1%的准确率损失，在立体匹配上恢复71.9%，在光流上恢复29.2%，首次为密集预测任务建立通用测试时防御。

Conclusion: 该方法具有训练免费、架构无关和攻击无关的特点，展现了在多种任务上的实用性和通用性。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机神经网络方法主要关注改进跨信息预测，而没有对整体随机网络架构进行显著改进。

Method: 利用超球面随机嵌入结合双分支学习模块来捕获通道内和通道间关系，并通过新制定的优化问题构建丰富的纹理表示。

Result: 在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中显示出有趣的结果。

Conclusion: Mixer方法在纹理表示学习方面取得了显著成果，源代码将在发表后提供。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RULER tokens和I-MRoPE两种创新方法，解决GUI grounding任务中高分辨率显示器的坐标映射问题，显著提升了跨分辨率平台的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在GUI grounding任务中面临核心瓶颈：可靠的补丁到像素映射在训练未见的高分辨率显示器上失效。现有方法直接生成文本坐标，迫使模型隐式学习复杂的位置到像素映射，导致精度下降和失败增多。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，让模型能够像地图上的网格线一样参考位置，而不是从头生成坐标；2. 交错MRoPE(I-MRoPE)改进空间编码，确保宽度和高度维度得到平等表示，解决标准位置方案的不对称问题。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示，定位精度持续提升，在高分辨率界面上改进最为显著。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而非依赖隐式学习，该方法能够在不同分辨率和平台上实现更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

TL;DR: LEAML是一个标签高效的MLLM适应框架，利用少量标注数据和大量未标注图像，通过QA生成器和选择性神经元更新来解决专业领域OOD任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在通用视觉基准上表现良好，但在医学影像等专业领域的OOD任务中表现不佳，因为标注数据有限且昂贵。

Method: 使用QA生成器为未标注数据生成领域相关的伪问答对，通过标题蒸馏进行正则化，并选择性更新与问答最相关的神经元。

Result: 在胃肠道内窥镜和体育VQA任务上的实验表明，LEAML在最小监督下始终优于标准微调。

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺的专业领域视觉问答任务中表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

TL;DR: BrowserArena是一个开放的网页代理评估平台，通过收集用户提交的任务、进行Arena式对比测试和使用步骤级人工反馈来识别代理失败模式，发现了验证码解析、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航三个主要失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实的开放网页环境来评估代理性能。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户任务，进行头对头对比测试，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对失败模式构建专门数据集。

Result: 识别出三个一致的失败模式：验证码解析、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航。发现不同语言模型在这些任务上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，而DeepSeek-R1在验证码解析上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网页代理具有多样性和脆弱性，该基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网页代理失败模式提供了途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has
opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI
agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their
effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied

our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患：恶意或错误的示例可能影响模型行为，需要内置防御机制来保护模型免受此类攻击。

Method: 定义零样本下的安全行为基准，应用分布无关风险控制来限制上下文示例对性能的负面影响，通过动态提前退出机制忽略关注有害输入的后层注意力头。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上实现显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功平衡了安全性和效率，为LLMs在面对不确定上下文示例时提供了可靠的防御机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型多模态模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但其内部支持任务学习的机制仍然不透明，需要深入理解模型如何编码和利用空间关系知识。

Method: 使用合成和真实图像数据集，应用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持LMM参数冻结的情况下用少量训练数据微调这些向量。

Result: 提取的功能向量在推理时提高了零样本准确率，微调后显著优于上下文学习基线，并能通过线性组合解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: LMM在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，这增进了对模型模块化的理解，并增强了对LMM中关系推理的控制能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Motivation: 研究基础模型在真实世界任务中处理多模态数据时的联合推理能力，特别是当不同模态之间存在交互和关联形成跨模态上下文时。通过跨模态冲突场景来检验模型是否能够协调处理多模态信息。

Method: 使用跨模态冲突场景进行实验，分析模型在单模态和跨模态情况下的表现差异。通过注意力分析发现跨模态注意力不平衡问题，并提出通过在每个训练实例中显式组合多种模态的简单可扩展方法来减少注意力不平衡。

Result: 实验显示模型在单模态冲突识别中达到90%准确率，但在跨模态情况下骤降至3%。跨语言场景也有类似现象。注意力分析显示模型存在极端不对称的注意力分布。提出的方法能显著减少注意力不平衡，并直接提升多个视觉语言基准测试的下游性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了系统性地处理跨模态上下文对于构建可靠基础模型的重要性。盲目扩大多模态或多语言数据集无法解决跨模态注意力不平衡问题，需要显式训练跨模态推理能力。

reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

TL;DR: AutoMaAS是一个自进化的多智能体架构搜索框架，通过神经架构搜索原则自动发现最优智能体配置，在保持性能的同时降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化设计方法寻求单一解决方案，无法根据查询复杂度和领域需求自适应分配资源，需要更灵活的多智能体系统设计框架。

Method: 采用神经架构搜索原则，包含四个关键创新：自动算子生成、融合和消除；动态成本感知优化；在线反馈集成；增强可解释性的决策追踪机制。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，AutoMaAS实现了1.0-7.1%的性能提升，同时推理成本降低3-5%，在数据集和LLM骨干网络上表现出优异的可迁移性。

Conclusion: AutoMaAS为大型语言模型时代的多智能体系统自动化设计建立了新范式，展示了优越的性能和成本效益。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

### [70] [On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611)
*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时扩展(TTS)在样本数量K很大时收益递减，提出温度维度扩展能显著提升LLM推理能力，使基础模型达到接近RL训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法仅通过增加样本数量来提升推理能力，但这种方法在大K值时收益递减，且不同温度设置能解决不同子集的问题，说明单温度扩展只探索了模型潜力的一部分。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展方法，在不同采样温度下生成多个推理轨迹，并设计多温度投票方法来降低温度扩展的开销。

Result: 在Qwen3系列模型和五个推理基准测试上，温度扩展比单温度TTS额外提升7.3个百分点，使基础模型性能接近RL训练模型，无需额外后训练。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展比之前认为的更强大，温度扩展提供了一种简单有效的方法来解锁基础模型的潜在能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的可能性概念作为Zadeh传统可能性理论的替代，专注于现实世界事件的可能性计算，基于事件前提条件和约束的概率函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代Zadeh于1978年提出的传统可能性理论，专注于现实世界事件的可能性评估，特别适用于规划问题。

Method: 将事件视为具有促成其发生的前提条件和阻碍其发生的约束，可能性通过前提条件成立概率和约束不成立概率的函数计算。

Result: 开发了一个新的可能性理论框架，能够评估多个计划中哪个最容易完成，并通过车辆路线规划示例进行了说明。

Conclusion: 这种可能性模型可能正确捕捉了人类关于计划的正常推理，在规划问题中具有应用潜力，并提出了未来应用方向。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs是一个自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效引发目标视觉语言模型的有害输出，在基准测试中攻击成功率平均超过基线52.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型(VLMs)的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界VLM漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式，通过模型上下文协议(MCP)集成17种红队算法，设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法来平衡攻击的多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs实现了最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建了ARMs-Bench数据集，包含超过30K红队实例，涵盖51个风险类别。

Conclusion: 使用ARMs-Bench进行安全微调显著提高了VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可操作指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Motivation: 现代制造业中，将制造需求转化为正式约束的过程仍然依赖人工且劳动密集，而直接应用生成模型面临自然语言歧义、非确定性输出和领域知识有限的挑战。

Method: 设计了一个分层结构化空间的约束中心架构，通过领域特定表示确保精确性和可靠性，同时开发了自动生产场景适配算法来定制特定制造配置。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法成功平衡了LLM的生成能力与制造系统的可靠性需求，在约束规范任务中显著优于纯基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的约束中心架构能够可靠地自动化生产调度中的约束规范，为制造业提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力分散，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: NCV将验证重构为节点级的轻量级二元一致性检查，将思维链分解为相互连接的验证节点，避免不必要的长文本生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上，NCV相比基线方法F1分数提升10%到25%，同时比传统方法如基于CoT的验证器减少6到58倍的token使用。

Conclusion: NCV提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，提高了LLM推理验证的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个用于评估工具增强型LLM代理性能的多维评估框架，通过证据库机制实现对推理轨迹的多方面分析，解决了传统仅关注最终答案匹配的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准主要依赖答案匹配评估，无法评估代理在复杂任务中的推理轨迹质量，包括效率、幻觉和适应性等重要维度。

Method: 提出TRACE框架，通过证据库积累推理步骤中的知识，实现对代理推理轨迹的多维度评估，并构建了包含多样化有缺陷轨迹的元评估数据集进行验证。

Result: TRACE能够准确、可扩展且经济高效地评估复杂代理行为，即使是小型开源LLM也能实现良好效果，并揭示了之前未报告的观察结果。

Conclusion: TRACE框架为工具增强型LLM代理提供了全面的评估方法，超越了传统答案匹配的限制，能够深入分析推理轨迹的多个重要维度。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了机器学习中的目标满足假设(OSA)，指出由于近似、估计和优化误差，模型无法真正满足指定目标函数，且开发者意图无法完美转化为形式化目标，导致目标错误设定不可避免。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验机器学习中一个常见但很少被验证的假设——训练得到的模型确实满足其指定的目标函数(OSA)，并探讨OSA失效的现实影响。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的框架，分析近似误差、估计误差和优化误差如何导致系统性偏离预期目标，并基于近期数学结果论证这些差距与Goodhart定律失效模式难以区分。

Result: 证明在现实条件下OSA必然失效，目标错误设定不可避免，且无法预先确定Goodhart临界点，持续优化可能导致系统进入可预测且不可控的状态。

Conclusion: 需要对通用人工智能系统的优化设定原则性限制，否则持续优化可能推动系统进入可预测且不可逆的失控状态。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BayesianRouter框架，通过结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，动态选择奖励模型来提升大语言模型对齐质量，避免单一RM的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLHF/RLAIF流程依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并存在过拟合风险。现有RM路由方法存在冷启动和探索不足的问题。

Method: 采用混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个RM的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行逐查询RM选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布。

Result: 在指令跟随（AlpacaEval-2、Arena-Hard、MT-Bench）和推理（GSM8K、MMLU）基准测试中，BayesianRouter始终优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过有效结合离线和在线学习，解决了RM路由中的冷启动和探索不足问题，显著提升了语言模型对齐性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来了更稳定和高效的更新，导致更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了MaskGRPO作为一种系统性的策略优化方法，并且是离散化视觉扩散的第一个实用方法。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Conclusion: 在选择XAI方法时需要考虑其基础的本体论和认识论假设，为不同应用领域选择和适配适当的XAI方法至关重要，以避免解释的有效性问题。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Method: 在Impartial-RAVEN数据集上，故意在训练时遗漏若干结构规则，然后评估序列到序列transformer模型和视觉架构（如CoPINet和Dual-Contrast Network）的泛化能力。

Result: transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或遗漏规则时准确率急剧下降；token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 当前深度学习方法在抽象推理方面存在根本局限，需要开发超越模式识别、实现稳健抽象推理的新架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合连续离散扩散模型CCDD，通过在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的联合空间中进行多模态扩散，解决了连续扩散模型在语言建模中表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散模型理论上比离散扩散模型和循环变换器具有更强的表达能力，但实际性能较差。作者认为这种矛盾源于训练性问题：连续扩散虽然提供中间监督，但从连续表示解码到离散标记空间存在困难。

Method: 提出CCDD模型，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的联合空间上定义联合多模态扩散过程，使用单一模型同时在联合空间中进行去噪。结合两种模态的优势，在潜在空间中具有丰富的语义表达，同时通过显式离散标记获得良好的训练性和样本质量。

Result: 在真实世界任务的语言建模实验中展现出强大的实证性能，证明了CCDD方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CCDD通过联合连续离散扩散过程，成功解决了连续扩散模型在语言建模中的训练性问题，实现了理论表达能力与实际性能的统一。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

Motivation: 传统CTF-MNMF在高度混响环境中表现出色，但其迭代投影更新规则需要为每个源进行矩阵求逆，计算成本高，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 将迭代源转向(ISS)集成到CTF-MNMF中，ISS是一种无需矩阵求逆的分离滤波器更新规则。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在分离性能上与原CTF-MNMF相当或更优，同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的CTF-MNMF-ISS方法在保持高性能的同时，大幅提升了计算效率，解决了原方法实际部署的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Among numerous blind source separation (BSS) methods, convolutive transfer
function-based multichannel non-negative matrix factorization (CTF-MNMF) has
demonstrated strong performance in highly reverberant environments by modeling
multi-frame correlations of delayed source signals. However, its practical
deployment is hindered by the high computational cost associated with the
iterative projection (IP) update rule, which requires matrix inversion for each
source. To address this issue, we propose an efficient variant of CTF-MNMF that
integrates iterative source steering (ISS), a matrix inversion-free update rule
for separation filters. Experimental results show that the proposed method
achieves comparable or superior separation performance to the original
CTF-MNMF, while significantly reducing the computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接以自回归方式生成音频波形具有挑战性，因为原始序列长度长且存在多时间尺度的重要结构。传统RNN、因果卷积和自注意力方法在此任务上效果有限。

Method: 使用深度状态空间模型（线性RNN），探索不同架构选择，并采用上下文并行性技术，支持在长达1分钟（100万个token）的序列上进行训练。

Result: HarmonicRNN在小规模数据集上获得了最先进的似然度和感知指标。

Conclusion: 线性RNN在原始音频建模中具有显著潜力，通过适当的架构改进和训练技术可以取得优异性能。

Abstract: Directly learning to generate audio waveforms in an autoregressive manner is
a challenging task, due to the length of the raw sequences and the existence of
important structure on many different timescales. Traditional approaches based
on recurrent neural networks, as well as causal convolutions and
self-attention, have only had limited success on this task. However, recent
work has shown that deep state space models, also referred to as linear RNNs,
can be highly efficient in this context. In this work, we push the boundaries
of linear RNNs applied to raw audio modeling, investigating the effects of
different architectural choices and using context-parallelism to enable
training on sequences up to one minute (1M tokens) in length. We present a
model, HarmonicRNN, which attains state of the art log-likelihoods and
perceptual metrics on small-scale datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的集成对比学习和生成方法的多视图框架在环境声音表示学习方面优于传统自监督技术，并能有效捕获和解耦声音属性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, such as contrastive and generative
methods, have advanced environmental sound representation learning using
unlabeled data. However, how these approaches can complement each other within
a unified framework remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose
a multi-view learning framework that integrates contrastive principles into a
generative pipeline to capture sound source and device information. Our method
encodes compressed audio latents into view-specific and view-common subspaces,
guided by two self-supervised objectives: contrastive learning for targeted
information flow between subspaces, and reconstruction for overall information
preservation. We evaluate our method on an urban sound sensor network dataset
for sound source and sensor classification, demonstrating improved downstream
performance over traditional SSL techniques. Additionally, we investigate the
model's potential to disentangle environmental sound attributes within the
structured latent space under varied training configurations.

Motivation: 吉他自动转录系统存在局限性：无法检测和标注表达技巧（如滑音、弯音、打击音），在生成的指法谱中将音符映射到错误的弦和品组合，且通常在小规模孤立数据集上训练，限制了在真实世界吉他录音中的泛化能力。

Method: 四阶段端到端管道：(1) 通过适应吉他数据集的钢琴转录模型进行音频到MIDI音高转换；(2) 基于MLP的表达技巧分类；(3) 基于Transformer的弦和品分配；(4) 基于LSTM的指法谱生成。

Conclusion: 提出的端到端管道克服了现有吉他自动转录系统的局限性，能够生成包含表达技巧和准确指法分配的详细吉他指法谱。

Abstract: Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) has advanced significantly for the piano,
but transcription for the guitar remains limited due to several key challenges.
Existing systems fail to detect and annotate expressive techniques (e.g.,
slides, bends, percussive hits) and incorrectly map notes to the wrong string
and fret combination in the generated tablature. Furthermore, prior models are
typically trained on small, isolated datasets, limiting their generalizability
to real-world guitar recordings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
four-stage end-to-end pipeline that produces detailed guitar tablature directly
from audio. Our system consists of (1) Audio-to-MIDI pitch conversion through a
piano transcription model adapted to guitar datasets; (2) MLP-based expressive
technique classification; (3) Transformer-based string and fret assignment; and
(4) LSTM-based tablature generation. To the best of our knowledge, this
framework is the first to generate detailed tablature with accurate fingerings
and expressive labels from guitar audio.

Motivation: 解决现有零样本TTS方法中存在的合成不可靠、推理速度慢、计算开销大以及时间多样性不足等问题，提升合成语音的自然度和质量。

Method: 重新设计流匹配训练范式，结合离散和连续的语音表示，分别对应语音的不同属性，以优化合成过程。

Conclusion: Flamed-TTS在零样本TTS任务中表现出色，平衡了计算效率、合成质量和时间多样性，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) has recently advanced significantly, enabling
models to synthesize speech from text using short, limited-context prompts.
These prompts serve as voice exemplars, allowing the model to mimic speaker
identity, prosody, and other traits without extensive speaker-specific data.
Although recent approaches incorporating language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have proven their effectiveness in zero-shot TTS, they still encounter
challenges such as unreliable synthesis caused by token repetition or
unexpected content transfer, along with slow inference and substantial
computational overhead. Moreover, temporal diversity-crucial for enhancing the
naturalness of synthesized speech-remains largely underexplored. To address
these challenges, we propose Flamed-TTS, a novel zero-shot TTS framework that
emphasizes low computational cost, low latency, and high speech fidelity
alongside rich temporal diversity. To achieve this, we reformulate the flow
matching training paradigm and incorporate both discrete and continuous
representations corresponding to different attributes of speech. Experimental
results demonstrate that Flamed-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art models in terms
of intelligibility, naturalness, speaker similarity, acoustic characteristics
preservation, and dynamic pace. Notably, Flamed-TTS achieves the best WER of 4%
compared to the leading zero-shot TTS baselines, while maintaining low latency
in inference and high fidelity in generated speech. Code and audio samples are
available at our demo page https://flamed-tts.github.io.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a digital audio forensics approach called
Forensic Similarity for Speech Deepfakes, which determines whether two audio
segments contain the same forensic traces or not. Our work is inspired by prior
work in the image domain on forensic similarity, which proved strong
generalization capabilities against unknown forensic traces, without requiring
prior knowledge of them at training time. To achieve this in the audio setting,
we propose a two-part deep-learning system composed of a feature extractor
based on a speech deepfake detector backbone and a shallow neural network,
referred to as the similarity network. This system maps pairs of audio segments
to a score indicating whether they contain the same or different forensic
traces. We evaluate the system on the emerging task of source verification,
highlighting its ability to identify whether two samples originate from the
same generative model. Additionally, we assess its applicability to splicing
detection as a complementary use case. Experiments show that the method
generalizes to a wide range of forensic traces, including previously unseen
ones, illustrating its flexibility and practical value in digital audio
forensics.

Abstract: Data hiding is essential for secure communication across digital media, and
recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide enhanced methods for
embedding secret information effectively. However, previous audio hiding
methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio,
due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency
relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new
DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish
a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the
reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues
from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during
recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This
approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also
enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical
applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data
from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms
of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of
noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.

without requiring dedicated fine-tuning or retraining. We demonstrate that
SALSA-V significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
audiovisual alignment and synchronization with video content in quantitative
evaluation and a human listening study. Furthermore, our use of random masking
during training enables our model to match spectral characteristics of
reference audio samples, broadening its applicability to professional audio

Abstract: Distributed optimization finds applications in large-scale machine learning,
data processing and classification over multi-agent networks. In real-world
scenarios, the communication network of agents may encounter latency that may
affect the convergence of the optimization protocol. This paper addresses the
case where the information exchange among the agents (computing nodes) over
data-transmission channels (links) might be subject to communication
time-delays, which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Our
proposed algorithm improves the state-of-the-art by handling heterogeneous and
arbitrary but bounded and fixed (time-invariant) delays over general
strongly-connected directed networks. Arguments from matrix theory, algebraic
graph theory, and augmented consensus formulation are applied to prove the
convergence to the optimal value. Simulations are provided to verify the
results and compare the performance with some existing delay-free algorithms.

Abstract: We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in
large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with
three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses
estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent
vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a
beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to
beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs
downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the
beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a)
semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical
gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge
distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an
unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers,
over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using
the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to
both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive
simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel
conditions.

positioning and reliable communication in 6G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
networks. These capabilities are vital for transmitting safety-critical data
from Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to improve metrics such as Time to
Collision (TTC) and reduce the Collision Risk (CR) ratio. However, limited
radio resources and interference remain major obstacles to achieving both
precision and capacity simultaneously. The challenge intensifies in
mixedtraffic scenarios involving Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), which lack
connectivity and cannot share their status or positioning. Additionally, CAV
sensors are limited in range and accuracy, making detection of HDVs unreliable.
ISAC plays a pivotal role here by enabling the sensing of HDV positions via
shared communication infrastructure, improving environmental awareness. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Value of Information
(VoI) metric that prioritizes the transmission of safety-critical data. The
joint sensing-communication-control problem is modeled as a two-time-scale
sequential decision process and solved using a Multi-Agent Distributed
Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. By focusing on high- VoI
data, the framework reduces complexity and optimizes network and traffic
resource usage. Simulations show that the proposed approach significantly
reduces the CR ratio by at least 33% and improves the TTC by up to 66%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing safety and efficiency in
mixedautonomy environments.

Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is rapidly proliferating across electric
vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, enhancing traffic
flow while simultaneously expanding the attack surface for communication-based
cyberattacks. Because the two powertrains translate control inputs into motion
differently, their cyber-resilience remains unquantified. Therefore, we
formalize six novel message-level attack vectors and implement them in a
ring-road simulation that systematically varies the ACC market penetration
rates (MPRs) and the spatial pattern of compromised vehicles. A three-tier risk
taxonomy converts disturbance metrics into actionable defense priorities for
practitioners. Across all simulation scenarios, EV platoons exhibit lower
velocity standard deviation, reduced spacing oscillations, and faster
post-attack recovery compared to ICE counterparts, revealing an inherent
stability advantage. These findings clarify how controller-to-powertrain
coupling influences vulnerability and offer quantitative guidance for the
detection and mitigation of attacks in mixed automated traffic.

Abstract: Vacuum disc filtration is critical in pulp mills for white liquor
clarification and pulp washing, involving tightly coupled dynamics between
rotational speed, vacuum pressure, slurry concentration, filtrate flow, and
cake thickness. These nonlinear interactions are often regulated using
empirical methods, lacking formal modeling and control. This article develops a
dynamic, multivariable model of a continuous-disc filter (CD-filter) system
based on first principles, simplified to a single representative disc for
tractability. A linearized state-space model supports the design of two control
strategies: a decentralized PI-based scheme and a centralized model predictive
control (MPC). MATLAB-Simulink simulations reveal that MPC outperforms PI in
tracking accuracy, overshoot reduction, and disturbance rejection. A 3D
efficiency surface illustrates the importance of coordinating inlet flow and
solids concentration. Results highlight the need for advanced multivariable
control in optimizing CD-filter performance.

Abstract: Extreme weather frequently cause widespread outages in distribution systems
(DSs), demonstrating the importance of hardening strategies for resilience
enhancement. However, the well-utilization of real-world outage data with
associated weather conditions to make informed hardening decisions in DSs is
still an open issue. To bridge this research gap, this paper proposes a
data-driven stochastic distribution line (DL) hardening strategy. First, a deep
neural network (DNN) regression model is developed to predict the probabilistic
evolution of outage scenarios under various hardening decisions. Based on the
DNN predictions, the problem is formulated as a decision-dependent
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model, accounting for uncertainties
in outage scenario distributions using a data-driven ambiguity set. To address
decision-dependent uncertainty, a Bayesian online learning algorithm is
proposed. This algorithm decomposes the original problem into inner and outer
problems. Then, it iteratively refines hardening decisions by sequentially
incorporating outage data and dynamically updating decision-specific ambiguity
sets by using Bayes' theorem and Bayesian Inference. Also, the convergence of
the algorithm is proven through dynamic regret analysis. Finally, case studies
are implemented on a real-world DS in Redfield, Iowa, USA. A dataset spanning
24 years (2001-2024) is constructed based on the utility outage records. The
simulation results validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种情境感知的多层次负荷恢复框架，通过混合整数线性规划和滚动时域优化解决电力分配系统中跨多个馈线的复杂恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注相邻馈线间的负荷转移，但在实践中当相邻馈线容量不足时，需要从更远的馈线获取支持。这种多层次恢复在考虑冷负荷启动和分布式能源延迟重连等动态系统条件时尤为复杂。

Conclusion: 所提出的保护滚动策略保证每个时间步的恢复潜力不低于最优值的(1-ε)比例，在短期开关决策和长期恢复目标之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Restoration in power distribution systems (PDSs) is well studied, however,
most existing research focuses on network partition and microgrid formation,
where load transfer is limited to adjacent feeders. This focus is not
practical, as when adjacent feeders lack sufficient capacity, utilities may
request support from more distant feeders in practice. Such a hirarchical
restoration is complex, especially when involving changing system conditions
due to cold load pickup and delayed reconnection of behind-the-meter DERs. To
fill this research gap, a situationally aware multi-tier load restoration
framework is proposed. Specifically, models are proposed to describe the
multi-tier load restoration, including the multi-tier load transfer and
substation transformer and feeder protection models. By introducing binary
actional switching variables and load block transfer variables, the models
effectively captures the dynamics of switches and multi-tier transfer process.
To integrate situational awareness of evolving system conditions, the problem
is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and then embedded within
a rolling horizon optimization. Particularly, a set of safeguarded constraints
are developed based on segment-level restoration reward bounds to mitigate the
myopia of traditional rolling horizon optimization. The proposed safeguarded
rolling strategy guarantees that each time step is lower bounded by a
$(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of its optimal restoration potential, thereby
balancing short-term switching decisions with long-term restoration goals.
Finally, cases studies on the modified IEEE 123-node test feeder validate the
proposed multi-tier restoration framework.

Abstract: Cyberattacks on pipeline operational technology systems pose growing risks to
energy infrastructure. This study develops a physics-informed simulation and
optimization framework for analyzing cyber-physical threats in petroleum
pipeline networks. The model integrates networked hydraulic dynamics,
SCADA-based state estimation, model predictive control (MPC), and a bi-level
formulation for stealthy false-data injection (FDI) attacks. Pipeline flow and
pressure dynamics are modeled on a directed graph using nodal pressure
evolution and edge-based Weymouth-type relations, including control-aware
equipment such as valves and compressors. An extended Kalman filter estimates
the full network state from partial SCADA telemetry. The controller computes
pressure-safe control inputs via MPC under actuator constraints and forecasted
demands. Adversarial manipulation is formalized as a bi-level optimization
problem where an attacker perturbs sensor data to degrade throughput while
remaining undetected by bad-data detectors. This attack-control interaction is
solved via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation, which results in a tractable
mixed-integer quadratic program. Test gas pipeline case studies demonstrate the
covert reduction of service delivery under attack. Results show that
undetectable attacks can cause sustained throughput loss with minimal
instantaneous deviation. This reveals the need for integrated detection and
control strategies in cyber-physical infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper presents a synthesis approach aiming to guarantee a minimum
upper-bound for the time taken to reach a target set of non-zero measure that
encompasses the origin, while taking into account uncertainties and input and
state constraints. This approach is based on a harmonic transformation of the
Lyapunov function and a novel piecewise quadratic representation of this
transformed Lyapunov function over a simplicial partition of the state space.
The problem is solved in a policy iteration fashion, whereas the evaluation and
improvement steps are formulated as linear matrix inequalities employing the
structural relaxation approach. Though initially formulated for uncertain
polytopic systems, extensions to piecewise and nonlinear systems are discussed.
Three examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in
different scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法具有实用性和在现实世界策略适应中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of adapting a predesigned policy,
represented by a parameterized function class, from a solution that minimizes a
given original cost function to a trade-off solution between minimizing the
original objective and an additional cost function. The problem is formulated
as a constrained optimization problem, where deviations from the optimal value
of the original cost are explicitly constrained. To solve it, we develop a
closed-loop system that governs the evolution of the policy parameters, with a
closed-loop controller designed to adjust the additional cost gradient to
ensure the satisfaction of the constraint. The resulting closed-loop system,
termed control-barrier-function-based policy adaptation, exploits the
set-invariance property of control barrier functions to guarantee constraint
satisfaction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through
numerical experiments on the Cartpole and Lunar Lander benchmarks from OpenAI
Gym, as well as a quadruped robot, thereby illustrating both its practicality
and potential for real-world policy adaptation.

Abstract: This article proposes a periodic event-triggered adaptive barrier control
policy for the trajectory tracking problem of perturbed Euler-Lagrangian
systems with state, input, and temporal (SIT) constraints. In particular, an
approximation-free adaptive-barrier control architecture is designed to ensure
prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed bound while
rejecting exogenous disturbances. In contrast to existing approaches that
necessitate continuous real-time control action, the proposed controller
generates event-based updates through periodic evaluation of the triggering
condition. Additionally, we derive an upper bound on the monitoring period by
analysing the performance degradation of the filtered tracking error to
facilitate periodic evaluation of the event-triggered strategy. To this end, a
time-varying threshold function is considered in the triggering mechanism to
reduce the number of triggers during the transient phase of system behaviour.
Notably, the proposed design avoids Zeno behaviour and precludes the need for
continuous monitoring of the triggering condition. A simulation and
experimental study is undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
control scheme.

model for electric field calculation inside the insulation thickness. The paper
firstly includes the development and the validation of BCT model with that

optimized using Pulsed Electro-Acoustic PEA space charge measurements. Followed
by the integration of the developed, validated and optimized model into the
electric field calculation for life estimation of a 500 kV DC-XLPE insulated
cable subjected to Type Test load cycles according to Cigre Techical Brochure

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for
sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system
parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for
entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative
noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy
Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that
despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under
conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on
zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm:
Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without
knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees
of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate
convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent
in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.

Abstract: Commercial building Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems
can provide flexibility to the electricity grid. Some researchers have found it
convenient to model HVAC systems as virtual batteries. These models also better
align with models used by grid planners and operators. However, experiments
have shown that HVAC load shifting can be inefficient, and virtual battery
models do not capture this inefficiency well. While the models typically use
the average room temperature as the system's ``state of charge," they do not
capture other factors that affect HVAC power/energy such as airflow and mixing.
Here, we develop a new analytical building model to explore how incomplete
mixing of supply air into a conditioned space leads to inefficiency in a
virtual battery capturing the dynamics of HVAC fan power load shifting. The
model qualitatively matches experimental results better than previous models,
and shows that, as mixing becomes worse, the virtual battery becomes less
efficient. Unfortunately, air mixing is unmeasured/unmeasurable. However, we
show that, by closing the loop around measurements of fan power, we can improve
the virtual battery's performance without the need for air mixing measurements.
For example, in one case, we show a roundtrip efficiency improvement from 0.75
to 0.99.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer energy trading offers a promising solution for enhancing
renewable energy utilization and economic benefits within interconnected
microgrids. However, existing real-time P2P markets face two key challenges:
high computational complexity in trading mechanisms, and suboptimal participant
decision-making under diverse uncertainties. Existing prediction-based
decision-making methods rely heavily on accurate forecasts, which are typically
unavailable for microgrids, while prediction-free methods suffer from myopic
behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an improved double
auction mechanism combined with an adaptive step-size search algorithm to
reduce computational burden, and a data-driven dual-reference online
optimization (DDOO) framework to enhance participant decision-making. The
improved mechanism simplifies bidding procedures, significantly reducing
computational burden and ensuring rapid convergence to the market equilibrium.
Additionally, the prediction-free DDOO framework mitigates myopic
decision-making by introducing two informative reference signals. Case studies
on a 20-microgrid system demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed mechanism and approach. The improved mechanism significantly decreases
the computational time while increasing local energy self-sufficiency periods
from 0.01% to 29.86%, reducing reverse power flow periods from 24.51% to 3.96%,
and lowering average operating costs by 19.20%. Compared with conventional
approaches such as Lyapunov optimization and model predictive control, the DDOO
framework achieves a 10%-13% reduction in operating costs with an optimality
gap of only 5.76%.

Abstract: Real-time regulation of water distribution in connected open water systems is
critical for ensuring system safety and meeting operational requirements. In
this work, we consider a connected open water system that includes linkage
hydraulic structures such as weirs, pumps and sluice gates. We propose a
mixed-integer economic zone data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) approach,
which is used to maintain the water levels of the branches within desired zones
to avoid floods and reduce the energy consumption of the pumps in the
considered water system. The proposed DeePC-based approach predicts the future
dynamics of the system water levels, and generates optimal control actions
based on system input and output data, thereby eliminating the need for both
first-principles modeling and explicit data-driven modeling. To achieve
multiple control objectives in order of priority, we utilize lexicographic
optimization and adapt traditional DeePC cost function for zone tracking and
energy consumption minimization. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is
utilized to determine the control target zone, which effectively balances zone
tracking and energy consumption in the presence of external disturbances.
Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method maintains water
levels within the desired zone for 97.04% of the operating time, with an
average energy consumption of 33.5 kWh per 0.5 h. Compared to baseline methods,
the proposed approach reduces the zone-tracking mean square error by 98.82%
relative to economic zone DeePC without Bayesian optimization, and lowers
energy consumption by 44.08% relative to economic set-point tracking DeePC. As
compared to passive pump/gate control, the proposed method lowers the frequency
of zone violations by 86.94% and the average energy consumption by 4.69%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力系统模型中存在时滞变量时，需要有效跟踪特征值随参数变化的轨迹，以分析系统稳定性。

Method: 采用基于数值积分的延拓方法，可将时滞大小本身作为变化参数，并详细讨论了实现细节。

Result: 在改进的IEEE 39节点系统上验证了准确性，并使用爱尔兰输电网络的实际动态模型讨论了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效跟踪含时滞电力系统模型的特征值轨迹，具有准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The paper focuses on tracking eigenvalue trajectories in power system models
with time delays. We formulate a continuation-based approach that employs
numerical integration to follow eigenvalues as system parameters vary, in the
presence of one or multiple delayed variables. The formulation preserves the
sparsity of the delay differential-algebraic equation (DDAE) system model and
allows treating the delay magnitude itself as a varying parameter with
implementation aspects discussed in detail. Accuracy is demonstrated on a
modified IEEE 39-bus system with distributed energy resources. Scalability is
discussed using a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission network.

TL;DR: 提出维度分解学习(DiD-L)方法，通过切片自适应神经映射(SANM)将高维识别问题分解为多个低维子任务，使用浅层神经网络和自适应律在线更新，无需预训练或持续激励条件，实现四旋翼在复杂动态扰动下的指数稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的DiD-L和SANM方法有效解决了高维识别问题，实现了四旋翼在复杂扰动下的稳定控制，且具有理论保证的指数收敛性能。

Abstract: Quadrotor stability under complex dynamic disturbances and model
uncertainties poses significant challenges. One of them remains the
underfitting problem in high-dimensional features, which limits the
identification capability of current learning-based methods. To address this,
we introduce a new perspective: Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L), from
which we develop the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM) approach for
geometric control. Specifically, the high-dimensional mapping for
identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings
(``slices"). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed
into a set of simple low-dimensional tasks addressed by shallow neural networks
and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online
via Lyapunov-based adaptation without any pre-training or persistent excitation
(PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we
prove that the full-state closed-loop system exhibits arbitrarily close to
exponential stability despite multi-dimensional time-varying disturbances and
model uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential
convergence without requiring pre-training for unknown disturbances and
specific knowledge of the model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于极值预测的数据增强框架，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强方法，使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步极值预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极值预测在金融和气候变化等领域具有重要应用价值，但面临数据不平衡的挑战。研究旨在探索数据增强方法如何提升极值预测性能。

Method: 使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，结合GANs和SMOTE数据增强技术，并提出了基于相关函数的极值数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在短期和长期预测中表现最佳，Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据中表现优异，BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据增强特别是SMOTE方法能有效提升极值预测性能，不同深度学习模型在不同数据特性下具有互补优势。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型系列，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，解决了LLMs无法处理时间序列的局限性。该研究提出了两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在医学领域中无法处理时间序列数据的局限性，将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，实现多时间序列的推理能力。

Method: 提出了两种架构：1) OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt：通过软提示将可学习的时间序列标记与文本标记连接；2) OpenTSLM-Flamingo：通过交叉注意力机制显式集成时间序列与文本。在三个数据集（HAR-CoT、Sleep-CoT、ECG-QA-CoT）上进行基准测试。

Result: OpenTSLM模型在所有任务上都优于基线方法，在睡眠分期达到69.9 F1，在HAR任务达到65.4 F1，而仅微调的纯文本模型分别为9.05和52.2。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM模型也超过了GPT-4o的表现。Flamingo架构在长序列上表现更好且内存需求稳定。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功地将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，显著提升了医疗时间序列推理能力。Flamingo架构在性能和内存效率方面表现更优，为医疗AI应用提供了有力工具。所有代码、数据集和模型均已开源。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

*Lin Chen,Jun Chen,Minghui Qiu,Shuxin Zhong,Binghong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段物理信息架构解决雷达数据与地面降雨观测之间的空间对齐和物理转换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑，无法捕捉关键结构和局部极值，这对洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析造成限制。

Method: 采用物理信息两阶段架构：结构到点映射器通过双向映射将中尺度雷达结构投影到局地地面降雨，地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降过程中的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的评估显示，RainSeer相比最先进基线方法持续改进，MAE降低超过13.31%，显著提升了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理结构先验，成功解决了降雨场重建中的结构保持问题，为高精度降雨监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

*Parth Asawa,Alan Zhu,Matei Zaharia,Alexandros G. Dimakis,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advisor Models是一种轻量级参数化策略，通过强化学习训练，在上下文中对黑盒模型发出自然语言指导指令，实现动态优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，模型权重无法修改，只能通过提示进行定制。静态提示优化产生单一固定提示，无法适应不同输入、用户或环境。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），在输入和模型之间插入第二个小模型，基于环境奖励信号对每个实例进行行为塑造。

Result: 在涉及推理和个性化的多个领域中，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，是实现个性化和环境自适应AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于市场机制的数据选择器，通过预测市场定价训练样本，统一处理多种异质信号，在固定计算预算下实现高效数据筛选


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法面临信号异质性、权重设置随意的问题，需要更系统化的多信号整合框架

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场(LMSR)为每个样本定价，通过流动性参数控制集中度，引入主题归一化稳定校准，采用按token定价规则处理预算约束，并加入轻量级多样性头提升覆盖

Result: 在GSM8K上达到与强基线相当的性能，同时降低种子方差，选择开销<0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews上保持竞争力的准确率，同时改善平衡性和稳定性

Conclusion: 该框架在固定计算预算下统一了多信号数据筛选，适用于提示级推理和分类任务，提供了透明可控的聚合机制

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

### [118] [Assessing the Potential for Catastrophic Failure in Dynamic Post-Training Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02457)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

<details>

Motivation: 在大型数据集上训练现代神经网络计算和能耗密集，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 使用Frequent Directions草图在O(ℓD)内存中维护梯度几何，通过两遍、GPU友好的流程优先选择梯度与共识方向对齐的样本，避免N×N成对相似性和显式N×ℓ梯度存储。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAGE使用较小的保留率预算进行训练，同时保持与全数据训练和最新子集选择基线相当的准确性，并减少端到端计算和峰值内存。

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一个实用的、恒定内存的替代方案，可与剪枝和模型压缩互补，实现高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于不确定性的模型选择策略，通过选择预测不确定性最低的TabPFN模型进行集成，在siRNA敲低效能预测任务中取得了优于传统集成方法和单一模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物分子效能预测中，上下文学习器的性能高度依赖于提供的上下文，如何在没有真实标签的情况下选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放性问题。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，通过模型预测的分位数间范围（IQR）作为不确定性度量，选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成平均。

Result: 在siRNA敲低效能预测任务中，TabPFN模型超越了专业的最先进预测器，且模型的不确定性（IQR）与真实预测误差呈负相关。基于最低平均IQR的模型集成方法优于朴素集成或使用所有数据训练的单一模型。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是一种强大的无标签启发式方法，可用于优化生物分子效能预测。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Conclusion: 这些优化是模型和硬件无关的，可广泛应用于transformer架构，并扩展到监督微调和直接偏好优化等后训练阶段。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ACF的对比学习方法，通过挖掘可独立控制的潜在变量来解决强化学习中的表示问题，直接从像素观测中恢复可控因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因子化MDP算法需要已知因子化表示，而深度强化学习虽然能处理高维输入但无法利用因子化结构。ACF旨在解决这一表示问题。

Method: 使用对比学习方法挖掘可独立控制的潜在变量，利用动作稀疏性（每个动作通常只影响变量子集）来获取对比训练的信息数据。

Result: 在Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey三个基准测试中，ACF直接从像素观测中恢复了真实可控因子，始终优于基线解缠算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功解决了强化学习中的表示问题，能够从高维观测中发现可控因子结构，为利用因子化MDP的优势提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度强化学习(DRL)和有界极值搜索(ES)的混合控制器，用于提高非线性时变系统的鲁棒性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL在处理多参数系统时具有快速学习能力，但在系统模型快速变化时性能会严重下降；而ES虽然能处理时变系统和未知控制方向，但收敛速度慢且容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将DRL和bounded ES结合形成混合控制器，DRL利用历史数据快速学习多参数系统控制，ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过了单独使用DRL或ES的效果，在数值研究和粒子加速器自动调谐应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: DRL和bounded ES的结合能够互补优势，为时变多参数系统提供既快速又鲁棒的控制解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

Motivation: 挑战传统将SFT视为简单模仿学习的观点，建立SFT与逆强化学习的理论联系，探索从专家演示中学习密集奖励模型的可能性。

Method: 证明SFT目标是逆Q学习的特例，提出基线相对奖励函数从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，开发Dense-Path REINFORCE方法利用这些奖励进一步改进策略。

Conclusion: 重新定义SFT不仅作为策略模仿，更作为强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差学习框架，通过在多个交叉开关瓦片上顺序学习来补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差，从而在有限状态设备上实现片上训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉开关阵列直接在内存中进行深度神经网络计算，但有效的内存内训练通常需要至少8位电导状态才能匹配数字基线。实际上，许多有前景的忆阻器件（如ReRAM）由于制造限制仅提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度会显著降低训练精度。

Method: 提出残差学习框架，在多个交叉开关瓦片上顺序学习以补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差。理论分析显示最优性差距随着瓦片数量增加而缩小，并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的内存内模拟训练策略，同时成本分析确认仅产生适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 该残差学习框架能够有效解决有限状态忆阻器件的训练精度问题，为片上训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SFMG的新框架，利用谱特征映射将图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，通过定义测地线流来生成图，在保持性能的同时实现30倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义测地线流，并沿着这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，SFMG在图元、度和谱指标上与最先进方法性能相当，同时比基于扩散的模型快30倍，并能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，具有更好的几何结构捕捉能力、灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于IATC（动物间变换类）的模型-大脑比较方法，通过双向映射评估神经网络模型是否能伪装成典型被试，解决了模型预测性与机制识别准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏比较模型激活与大脑响应的共识方法，需要建立更严格的比较框架来评估神经网络模型作为大脑机制模型的准确性。

Method: 使用IATC方法，通过识别动物群体中准确映射神经响应的最严格函数集，双向映射模型响应与大脑数据，评估模型能否像真实被试一样被映射。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的细节特征（如非线性激活函数），实现神经活动的高精度预测，同时在不同脑区响应模式间实现高特异性分离，支持TDANNs作为视觉系统模型的新证据。

Conclusion: IATC为模型-大脑比较提供了原则性方法，证明模型预测性与机制识别准确性之间不存在固有权衡，改进了先前的方法并深化了对深度学习模型预测成功背景的理解。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Motivation: 开发一个能够同时学习行为特征表示、预测抑郁结果并识别行为亚型的模型，以从纵向可穿戴数据中获得临床可解释的见解。

Method: 使用注意力GRU自编码器联合优化三个目标：序列重构学习潜在表示、二元分类预测抑郁率、GMM软聚类识别行为亚型。

Result: 在372名参与者的睡眠数据上，聚类质量（轮廓分数0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74）均优于基线模型；在332名参与者的外部验证中确认了聚类的可重复性。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE能够有效识别行为亚型并预测抑郁结果，通过时间注意力可视化提供了临床可解释的风险解释。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Conclusion: 节点导数提供了一种增强GNN表达能力的自然方式，HOD-GNN方法在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标网络方法虽然稳定但学习速度慢，而使用在线网络作为目标会导致学习不稳定。MINTO旨在结合两者的优点。

Method: 引入新的更新规则，使用目标网络和在线网络之间的最小值估计来计算目标值，可以无缝集成到各种基于值和演员-评论家算法中。

Result: 在涵盖在线和离线强化学习、离散和连续动作空间的多样化基准测试中，MINTO始终提升性能表现。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单有效的修改，实现了更快更稳定的值函数学习，具有广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Result: 在合成和真实欺诈数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效捕捉复杂特征-目标关系，并能执行精确解。

Conclusion: MINERVA方法能够有效处理传统方法难以捕捉的高阶特征交互，在特征选择任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过超网络机制有效解决了AdaLoRA的收敛问题，为参数高效微调提供了新的解决方案，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Conclusion: 这是首个系统优化车辆巡检传感平台的研究，提出了专门设计的巡检车辆配置方案。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Method: 创建TutorBench数据集，包含1,490个高中和AP课程样本，涵盖三个辅导任务。使用样本特定评分标准和LLM法官进行自动评估，评估了16个前沿LLM。

Result: 所有前沿LLM的得分均不超过56%，在展示完整辅导技能方面存在不足。不同模型家族表现出不同优势：Claude模型在支持主动学习方面表现最佳，但在其他两个用例中落后。

Conclusion: TutorBench提供了一个全面且未饱和的基准，用于指导下一代AI辅导系统的开发，当前LLM在辅导能力方面仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

TL;DR: 论文证明，对于一类置换等变学习规则，训练过程在神经元之间诱导双Lipschitz映射，并约束神经元分布的拓扑结构。学习率η存在临界点η*：低于η*时训练保持所有拓扑结构，高于η*时允许拓扑简化，降低模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究学习率如何影响神经网络训练过程中的拓扑结构变化，揭示小学习率和大学习率下训练动力学的本质差异。

Method: 通过分析置换等变学习规则（包括SGD、Adam等）在训练过程中诱导的神经元间映射特性，建立拓扑约束理论框架。

Result: 发现学习率临界点η*：η<η*时拓扑结构完全保持，η>η*时发生拓扑简化，神经元流形逐渐粗糙化。结合边缘稳定性现象，训练分为两个阶段：平滑优化和拓扑简化。

Conclusion: 该理论独立于具体架构和损失函数，为深度学习研究提供了通用的拓扑分析方法，揭示了学习率对神经网络表达能力的重要影响。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于指数集中现象的无损低精度浮点格式ECF8，通过理论分析和实验验证，在大型生成AI模型中实现了26.9%的内存节省和177.1%的吞吐量加速，且计算完全无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成AI模型参数规模达到数千亿，低精度计算成为高效部署的关键。传统方法存在数值不稳定性和去量化开销问题，需要开发低精度浮点格式来提供数值稳定性、内存节省和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 指数集中现象是训练模型的一个统计规律，为FP8时代的无损低精度浮点设计开辟了一条原则性路径。

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Conclusion: 通过将GP的符号推理能力与LLMs的解释和生成优势相结合，EvoSpeak推动了面向现实世界优化问题的智能、透明和用户对齐的启发式方法的发展。

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

Motivation: 预训练扩散模型能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但需要根据下游应用使用奖励函数来塑造这些分布。传统策略梯度方法在扩散模型中由于边缘似然难以处理而受限。

Method: 提出GRAFT统一RAFT变体，引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别进行分布塑造，并提出逆噪声校正方法改进流模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成等任务上验证。应用于Stable Diffusion 2时，在VQAScore上优于策略梯度方法，相对基础模型提升8.81%。无条件图像生成中，逆噪声校正以更低FLOPs/图像改善了FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架为扩散模型提供有效的分布塑造方法，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声级别优化提升了微调效果，逆噪声校正可在无显式奖励情况下改进流模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

TL;DR: RAMAC框架结合表达性生成actor和distributional critic，在离线RL中实现风险敏感学习，在保持高回报的同时降低尾部风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，离线RL需要提供高回报且避免灾难性风险。现有风险规避方法过于保守且限制策略类别，而表达性策略仅用于风险中性设置

Method: 提出RAMAC框架，将表达性生成actor（扩散和流匹配模型）与distributional critic耦合，通过生成路径区分组合目标（分布风险和BC损失）

Result: 在大多数Stochastic-D4RL任务中，RAMAC在保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上获得一致提升

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线RL中风险敏感学习与策略表达性之间的权衡问题

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self

spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

Conclusion: RAGC通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知策略，有效提升了属性图聚类的判别能力，在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic
biogeochemistry.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨生物神经网络是否使用类似梯度下降的学习策略，研究发现学习动态可能包含非梯度的"旋度"分量，这些分量在抑制-兴奋连接或Hebbian/反Hebbian可塑性中自然出现，导致无法用梯度下降框架描述的学习动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生物神经网络是否使用梯度下降策略进行学习，以及探索非梯度学习动态的可能性，挑战梯度学习的规范性理论。

Method: 在前馈网络中采用学生-教师分析框架，通过规则翻转可塑性的神经元系统引入非梯度动态，分析旋度项对学习动态的影响。

Result: 小旋度项保持原始解流形的稳定性，学习动态类似梯度下降；超过临界值后，强旋度项破坏解流形稳定性，可能导致混沌学习动态或通过暂时上升损失来加速学习。

Conclusion: 特定网络架构能够通过多样化的学习规则支持稳健学习，为神经网络中基于梯度学习的规范性理论提供了重要补充。

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

Conclusion: 深度ReLU网络在梯度下降训练下能够达到接近最优的泛化性能，关键技术创新是对激活模式的精细控制，为深度学习的泛化理论提供了新的洞见。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的在线共形预测方法，通过使用更广泛的函数来量化预测区间的相关性，而不是简单的二元评估，从而产生更窄的预测区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线共形预测方法在阈值更新时只关注预测区间的有效性（真实值是否在区间内），而忽略了区间的相关性。本文旨在利用这一被忽视的方面来改进方法。

Method: 提出在阈值更新步骤中，用更广泛的函数类替换二元评估（内部/外部），这些函数使用真实值来量化预测区间的相关性，有助于防止阈值突变。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，这些函数可以产生比现有OCP方法更紧密的区间，同时保持覆盖有效性。

Conclusion: 通过量化预测区间相关性的方法能够产生更窄的预测区间，同时维持覆盖有效性，为在线共形预测提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理在全球范围内持续进行，已成为AI能耗的主要来源，但现有研究仅提供粗粒度的模型级指标，缺乏细粒度测量方法，无法有效指导能效优化。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法，通过重复采样克服微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗监测的时间尺度不匹配问题，评估了15个涵盖四种架构类型的模型。

Result: CLEAR方法能将组件级能耗方差控制在9.5%以下，捕获超过90%模型总能耗；注意力块每FLOP能耗显著高于其他组件，表明能耗与FLOP计数不成比例。

Conclusion: 建立了详细的组件级能耗基准，为通过组件级优化构建能效更高的Transformer模型提供了重要见解和初始步骤。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到虚假相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移具有鲁棒性，但对组内分布偏移仍然脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出了Group DRO的分层扩展，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，通过扩大模糊集来更好地捕捉多层次的分布不确定性。

Result: 在新设计的模拟现实少数群体分布偏移的基准测试中，该方法表现出强大的鲁棒性，而现有鲁棒学习方法在这些条件下持续失败。同时在标准基准测试中也取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性对于实现真正的分布鲁棒性至关重要。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Motivation: 随机顺序模型中的输入序列虽然渐近等价于独立同分布序列，但在有限时间内可能表现出显著的非平稳性，这会阻碍随机学习算法的性能。

Result: 恢复了延迟预测、带约束在线学习和带切换成本赌博机的改进遗憾界，并证明了在随机顺序下可学习性由VC维度而非Littlestone维度刻画。

Conclusion: 随机顺序模型提供了介于随机和对抗模型之间的中间设置，本文的方法能够有效利用随机性同时保持对非平稳性的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

Conclusion: FlexiQ在NPU和GPU上引入最小运行时开销，证明了其硬件效率和整体性能优势，能够有效管理波动的推理工作负载。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for

feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art

efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列建模任务时面临计算负担与表达能力之间的平衡挑战。核心问题是如何在最大化表达性的同时限制计算成本，因为更新成本随状态维度线性增长。

Method: 基于控制理论中的Hankel奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别并保留高影响力的维度，对线性时不变SSMs进行平衡截断。该方法利用Hankel矩阵的特征值稳定性特性，可扩展到选择性模型。

Result: 实验表明，训练过程中的维度缩减显著加速了优化过程，同时保持了模型的表达能力。压缩后的模型保留了任务关键结构，这些结构在直接训练较小维度模型时会丢失。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中缩减的SSMs能够实现计算效率，同时保持更高的性能表现，证明了在训练过程中进行模型压缩的有效性。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

Conclusion: 迭代优化框架为理解VAR模型提供了新视角，揭示了关键设计选择的作用，并展示了该框架在多领域的扩展潜力，同时保持了少步并行生成的优势。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

*Aleksei Arzhantsev,Otmane Sakhi,Flavian Vasile*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoiRL是一种轻量级离线强化学习方法，用于改进大语言模型的推理能力，无需真实奖励标签，比现有的测试时强化学习方法训练更快、性能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时强化学习（TTRL）方法虽然不需要真实奖励，但依赖在线强化学习，计算成本高昂。需要一种更轻量、更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出RoiRL方法，通过离线迭代强化学习优化加权对数似然目标，无需维护参考模型，显著降低内存和计算需求。

Result: 实验结果显示，RoiLL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中持续优于TTRL。

Conclusion: RoiRL为无标签的自改进大语言模型提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的数字水印框架，通过三种策略解决非顺序解码带来的水印检测难题，在保持文本质量的同时实现92.0-99.5%的高检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型相比自回归模型生成速度更快，但传统水印方法因其非顺序解码特性而失效，需要专门设计适用于非因果解码的水印方案。

Method: 提出三种互补策略：预测水印（使用模型预测的token）、双向水印（利用扩散解码特有的前后向依赖）、预测-双向水印（结合前两者最大化检测强度）。

Result: 在多个dLLM上的实验显示，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，而现有方法的简单适配仅能达到49.6-71.2%，同时保持文本质量。

Conclusion: DMark证明了在非自回归语言模型中实现有效水印是可行的，并对文本操作具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

TL;DR: Cell-MNN是一种端到端的编码器-解码器架构，通过局部线性化的ODE建模细胞分化动力学，能够学习可解释的基因相互作用，在单细胞基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的细胞分化动力学模型依赖计算成本高的最优输运预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用。

Method: 提出Cell-MNN编码器-解码器架构，其潜在表示是控制从干细胞到组织细胞演化的局部线性化ODE，完全端到端训练（除标准PCA预处理外）。

Result: Cell-MNN在单细胞基准测试中达到竞争性性能，在扩展到更大数据集和跨多个数据集联合训练方面超越现有基线，并学习到经过TRRUST基因相互作用数据库验证的可解释基因相互作用。

Conclusion: Cell-MNN为细胞分化动力学建模提供了一种高效、可扩展且可解释的解决方案，能够学习生物学一致的基因相互作用。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非独立同分布数据设置下的性能下降和公平性问题，特别是提升表现不佳客户端的训练效果。

Method: 结合多类AdaBoost的权重机制，为错误率较低的客户端分配更高权重；动态调整焦点损失参数，强调难以分类的样本以提升表现不佳客户端的训练。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的实验表明，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto方法，在公平性和性能方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: FeDABoost框架通过集成动态提升和自适应聚合策略，有效改善了联邦学习在非IID环境下的公平性和性能表现。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Motivation: 医疗时间序列分析面临数据稀疏、噪声和长度可变等挑战，需要既能处理变长信号又能提供解释性的方法。

Method: 扩展随机稀疏采样框架，通过通道内相似性加权窗口预测，在概率空间聚合生成序列级分数，提供明确的证据追踪。

Result: 在四个医疗中心收集的iEEG记录上验证，实现了竞争性的分类性能，并为从业者提供了更高的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在临床变长时间序列分类中实现可靠和可解释分类的潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Motivation: 现有的持续强化学习主要关注风险中性决策，而本文旨在探索风险感知决策在持续学习环境中的应用，填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过分析经典风险度量理论与持续学习的不兼容性，提出新的遍历风险度量类别，并进行案例研究和实证验证。

Result: 研究表明遍历风险度量在持续学习环境中具有直观吸引力和理论合理性，能够有效平衡信息保留和新情况适应。

Conclusion: 遍历风险度量为风险感知的持续强化学习提供了理论基础，扩展了风险度量理论在持续学习环境中的应用范围。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Motivation: 在真实部署场景中，当测试数据没有标签时，评估模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力至关重要。

Method: 使用模型预测的两个内在属性：置信度（反映预测确定性）和分散度（捕获预测类别的多样性），并系统比较基于置信度、分散度和混合指标的评估方法。

Result: 混合指标在两个评估设置中始终优于单方面指标，特别是预测矩阵的核范数在各种任务中提供稳健准确的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为部署场景中的无监督模型评估提供了实用且可推广的基础。

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够有效捕获专家行为的复杂结构。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型的训练通常依赖大规模数据集，但这些数据中的条件输入往往包含不精确信息（如噪声、模糊或不完整标签），导致条件不匹配和生成质量下降。

Method: 基于似然最大化推导框架，将目标分解为生成组件（建模模糊标签分布）和分类组件（使用扩散分类器推断类后验概率），并通过优化的时间步采样策略提高效率。

Result: 在多种模糊监督形式下的实验表明，DMIS能够持续生成高质量和类判别性的样本，涵盖图像生成、弱监督学习和噪声数据集压缩等任务。

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究模糊监督问题的框架，能够有效处理不精确标签并提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Motivation: EEG信号样本具有固有的反相关性，可以通过符号图中的负边很好地建模。为了用更少的参数实现有效的EEG信号分类，需要构建轻量级且可解释的神经网络。

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯等变神经网络为开发具有不确定性感知的大规模原子模拟MLPs提供了强大框架

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Conclusion: 该模型为连续黑盒优化提供了一个可重用的基础框架，支持未来扩展和改进。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的双解码器深度强化学习框架UD3RL来解决接近旅行商问题，将决策分为节点选择和路径点确定两个子任务，在解质量和运行时间上优于传统方法，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Motivation: 深度强化学习在解决旅行商问题方面取得了进展，但对于接近旅行商问题的关注有限，主要挑战在于其基于邻域的访问标准，即当智能体进入节点周围的紧凑邻域时即视为访问了该节点。

Method: 使用离散化方案为CETSP制定马尔可夫决策过程，提出统一双解码器DRL框架UD3RL，将决策分为节点选择和路径点确定两个子任务，采用适应编码器进行特征提取，节点解码器和位置解码器分别处理两个子任务，引入k近邻子图交互策略增强位置解码时的空间推理。

Result: 实验结果表明，UD3RL在解质量和运行时间上均优于传统方法，同时在问题规模、空间分布和半径范围方面展现出强大的泛化能力，并对动态环境具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UD3RL框架成功解决了CETSP问题，通过分离决策任务和增强空间推理，实现了优于传统方法的性能，并具有良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

Result: 在合成基准测试中表现出显著改进：链式GNN在挑战性实例上比现有方法准确率提高3倍以上，在常规图上唯一解决了所有竞争方法都失败的问题。与传统优化后处理结合后，在图对齐基准上大幅超越最先进求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法成功克服了传统GNN在图对齐问题上的局限性，通过迭代优化和全局结构捕捉实现了突破性性能提升，为GNN在组合优化问题上的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散和流式生成模型在蛋白质骨架生成任务中性能优异，但需要数百次迭代步骤，计算成本高，限制了在大规模蛋白质发现中的实际应用。

Method: 采用Score identity Distillation技术，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制，训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器，显著减少采样时间。

Result: 蒸馏后的少步生成器实现了20倍以上的采样速度提升，同时在可设计性、多样性和新颖性方面与原始Proteina教师模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际蛋白质工程应用，支持大规模计算机蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于图神经网络的自适应节点特征选择方法，通过在训练过程中识别并移除不必要的特征来提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据引入了复杂的依赖关系，传统的特征重要性度量方法可能不适用。需要一种能够衡量特征对模型输出贡献的方法，用于解释决策、降低维度，甚至通过消除无帮助变量来提升性能。

Method: 基于干预的方法，通过在训练过程中对特征值进行置换，根据验证性能的变化来确定相关特征。该方法与模型和任务无关，能够追踪特征相关性的演化过程。

Result: 经验结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性，以及在更具挑战性的图学习设置中的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能在训练结束后返回特征重要性分数，还能追踪特征被逐步移除时的相关性演化，有效监控特征消除过程并评估其他指标。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

TL;DR: AdaBet是一种无需梯度的层选择方法，通过分析激活空间的拓扑特征（Betti数）来识别重要层，用于在边缘设备上进行高效的重训练和适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上使用预训练神经网络时，需要在有限的计算和内存资源下适应用户特定的运行时数据分布。现有的层选择方法依赖标记数据、完整模型反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适用于受限设备。

Method: 提出AdaBet方法，通过分析神经网络层激活空间的拓扑特征（使用Betti数），仅使用前向传播就能对重要层进行排序和选择，无需标签或梯度。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上的评估显示，AdaBet比基于梯度的基线方法平均分类准确率提高5%，同时平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种高效、无需梯度的层选择方法，能够在资源受限的边缘设备上实现更好的模型适应性能。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Result: 在合成和真实语言建模任务上，VGB在多种指标上优于基线方法

Conclusion: VGB通过理论基础的随机回溯机制，显著提升了基于过程验证器的测试时采样算法对验证器错误的鲁棒性

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Conclusion: MoE学习中的近似误差与估计误差之间存在权衡关系，这种关系取决于专家数量，为MoE模型设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

TL;DR: 该论文为学习率预热提供了理论解释，证明了在广义平滑度条件下，预热策略比固定步长能实现更快的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率预热在现代深度学习中普遍使用，但其理论基础仍不明确，需要从原理上解释为什么预热能改善训练效果。

Method: 基于广义(L0,L1)-平滑度条件，该条件以损失次优性的线性函数来约束局部曲率，并具有理想的闭包性质。在此假设下，分析了带预热调度的梯度下降方法。

Result: 理论和实验证明该平滑度条件在常见神经网络架构中成立，预热调度相比固定步长能实现更快的收敛，并建立了上下复杂度界。

Conclusion: 通过语言和视觉模型的实验验证了理论洞察，确认了预热调度的实际益处，为这一常用启发式方法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

TL;DR: FTTE是一个新颖的半异步联邦学习框架，通过稀疏参数更新和基于客户端更新年龄与方差的陈旧度加权聚合，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了更快的收敛速度、更低的内存使用和通信负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分布式设备上的部署面临资源限制（内存、能源、通信带宽）的挑战，传统同步和异步方法在异构大规模网络中受到拖后腿节点延迟和收敛缓慢的影响。

Method: 采用半异步联邦学习框架，结合稀疏参数更新和基于客户端更新年龄与方差的陈旧度加权聚合机制。

Result: 在多达500个客户端和90%拖后腿节点的实验中，FTTE比同步联邦学习（如FedAVG）收敛速度快81%，设备内存使用降低80%，通信负载减少69%，并且在挑战性场景下达到与半异步方法（如FedBuff）相当或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个在异构且主要为资源受限的边缘设备上实用且可扩展的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非平稳强化学习中的分布漂移问题，传统QUCB算法在分布变化后可能利用次优奖励，需要更智能的探索策略。

Method: 使用转移密度函数检测分布漂移，利用似然值增强Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计质量，提出Density-QUCB算法。

Result: 理论证明DQUCB比QUCB有更好的遗憾保证；实验显示在RL任务和COVID-19患者分配任务中，DQUCB具有更低遗憾和计算效率。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法能有效处理非平稳环境中的分布漂移，在理论和实践中都优于传统QUCB方法。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Conclusion: PRISM-Physics通过结构严谨性、理论保证和符号验证，为推进过程级评估和开发具有更深科学推理能力的模型提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了叠加现象如何影响神经网络对齐度量，发现不同的叠加排列会干扰预测性映射度量，导致对齐分数偏低。通过稀疏自编码器解耦叠加可以揭示真实的表征对齐。

Motivation: 研究叠加假设与对齐度量之间的相互作用，验证不同叠加排列是否会对预测性映射度量产生不良影响，从而低估神经编码之间的真实对齐程度。

Method: 开发了关于严格置换度量对叠加排列依赖性的理论，使用稀疏自编码器在玩具模型中解耦叠加，并在视觉领域的DNN→DNN和DNN→大脑线性回归对齐中进行测试。

Result: 当用稀疏过完备潜在代码替换基础神经元时，对齐分数通常会增加；在视觉领域的线性回归对齐中也观察到类似增长。

Conclusion: 叠加解耦对于映射度量揭示神经编码之间真实表征对齐是必要的，不同的叠加排列会干扰对齐度量结果。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习和可穿戴传感器数据（惯性传感器和肌电图）来估计单臂哑铃弯举时的自觉用力程度（RPE），随机森林分类器表现最佳，准确率达41.4%，±1 RPE准确率达85.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计自觉用力程度（RPE）可以通过个性化反馈和预防伤害来增强抗阻训练效果。

Method: 收集了69组超过1000次重复的自定义数据集，使用可穿戴惯性传感器和肌电图（EMG）传感器数据，提取统计特征进行模型训练，评估了多种机器学习模型。

Result: 随机森林分类器性能最高，精确准确率为41.4%，±1 RPE准确率为85.9%。EMG数据的加入略微提高了模型准确性，但受数据质量和放置敏感性限制。特征分析显示离心重复时间是最强的RPE预测因子。

Conclusion: 结果证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计的可行性，并确定了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM推理策略Best-of-Majority(BoM)，结合多数投票和Best-of-N的优点，在Pass@k设置下实现最优推理性能，解决了传统方法在采样预算增加时性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM推理策略如多数投票和Best-of-N在困难任务中表现不佳，特别是在Pass@k评估设置下，这些方法无法随着k和采样预算N的增加而有效扩展。

Method: 提出Best-of-Majority(BoM)策略，首先将候选限制在N个样本中出现频率高的响应中，然后选择前k个奖励最高的响应。

Result: 理论证明当采样预算N=Ω(C*)时，BoM的遗憾为O(ε_opt+√(ε_RM²C*/k))，并建立了匹配的下界，证明算法是最小最大最优的。数学问题推理实验显示BoM优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM是一种最优的LLM推理策略，在Pass@k设置下具有更好的扩展性，且性能不会随着采样预算N的增加而下降。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Method: 通过理论模型（扰动块MDP）和模拟运动任务的受控实验，对比特权专家蒸馏与无特权信息的标准RL方法。

Result: 实验发现权衡取决于潜在动态的随机性，与理论预测一致；最优潜在策略并不总是最佳蒸馏对象。

Conclusion: 研究结果为有效利用特权信息提供了新指导原则，有望提升部分可观测领域中策略学习的效率。

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)方法，通过保护推理火花(reasoning sparks)来解决RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，在数学推理基准上实现60.17%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中存在探索瓶颈，性能会随着策略熵的崩溃而停滞。现有方法通常通过维持高策略熵来解决，但缺乏对有意义探索机制的理解，且无选择性地关注熵可能放大无关标记并破坏训练稳定性。

Method: 提出Lp-Reg方法，核心机制是通过构建启发式代理分布来正则化策略。该代理分布通过过滤掉噪声标记并对剩余候选重新归一化来构建，从而增强推理火花的概率，并通过KL散度作为软正则化目标来保护这些有价值的标记。

Result: Lp-Reg能够在约1000步内实现稳定的在线策略训练，而基线熵控制方法在此阶段会崩溃。在五个数学基准测试中达到60.17%的平均准确率，比先前方法提高了2.66%。

Conclusion: Lp-Reg通过保护低概率但关键的推理火花，有效解决了RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，实现了更稳定和有效的训练过程，在数学推理任务上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Method: 将感知约束建模为在线传感器选择问题，开发价值加权的目标函数，提出贪婪算法进行传感器选择，并为玩家2设计近视决策算法来利用玩家1的信念

Conclusion: 玩家1持续选择与其先验一致的传感器，使得玩家2能够系统性地利用其疏忽

Abstract: We study decision-making with rational inattention in settings where agents
have perception constraints. In such settings, inaccurate prior beliefs or
models of others may lead to inattention blindness, where an agent is unaware
of its incorrect beliefs. We model this phenomenon in two-player zero-sum
stochastic games, where Player 1 has perception constraints and Player 2
deceptively deviates from its security policy presumed by Player 1 to gain an
advantage. We formulate the perception constraints as an online sensor
selection problem, develop a value-weighted objective function for sensor
selection capturing rational inattention, and propose the greedy algorithm for
selection under this monotone objective function. When Player 2 does not
deviate from the presumed policy, this objective function provides an upper
bound on the expected value loss compared to the security value where Player 1
has perfect information of the state. We then propose a myopic decision-making
algorithm for Player 2 to exploit Player 1's beliefs by deviating from the
presumed policy and, thereby, improve upon the security value. Numerical
examples illustrate how Player 1 persistently chooses sensors that are
consistent with its priors, allowing Player 2 to systematically exploit its
inattention.

Abstract: In repeated games, players choose actions concurrently at each step. We
consider a parameterized setting of repeated games in which the players form a
population of an arbitrary size. Their utility functions encode a reachability
objective. The problem is whether there exists a uniform coalition strategy for
the players so that they are sure to win independently of the population size.
We use algebraic tools to show that the problem can be solved in polynomial
space. First we exhibit a finite semigroup whose elements summarize strategies
over a finite interval of population sizes. Then, we characterize the existence
of winning strategies by the existence of particular elements in this
semigroup. Finally, we provide a matching complexity lower bound, to conclude
that repeated population games with reachability objectives are
PSPACE-complete.

Abstract: Self-tracking is one of many behaviors involved in the long-term

volume, and availability of such data has dramatically improved. This
exploratory longitudinal N-of-1 study quantitatively assesses four years of
sleep data captured via the Oura Ring, a consumer-grade sleep tracking device,
along with self-reported mood data logged using eMood Tracker for iOS. After
assessing the data for stationarity and computing the appropriate lag-length
selection, a vector autoregressive (VAR) model was fit along with Granger
causality tests to assess causal mechanisms within this multivariate time

interfaces offer limited support for collaborative extension or real-world

be open (open-source and local), extensible (plugin support and users can
interact with multiple models), and usable. The extensibility is enabled
through a two-pronged plugin architecture and a community platform for sharing,
importing, and adapting extensions. To evaluate the system, we analyzed organic
engagement through social platforms, conducted a user survey, and provided
notable examples of the toolkit in the wild. Through studying how users engage
with and extend the toolkit, we show how extensible, open LLM interfaces
provide both functional and social value, and highlight opportunities for

TL;DR: 论文认为当前AI心智理论研究混淆了行为模拟与真实认知，主张从孤立测试转向关注人机交互中的相互心智理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI心智理论研究存在根本性误解，将行为预测和偏见修正误认为是真实心理状态，忽略了模拟与体验的关键区别。

Method: 通过批判性分析现有研究范式，提出将焦点从孤立测试AI转向人机交互动态中的相互心智理论框架。

Result: 指出LLMs在实验室任务中达到人类水平表现只是行为模仿，整个测试范式可能存在问题，不应将个体人类认知测试直接应用于AI系统。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义AI心智理论研究范式，强调人机交互中的相互认知过程，而非孤立评估AI的认知能力。

Abstract: When researchers claim AI systems possess ToM or mental models, they are
fundamentally discussing behavioral predictions and bias corrections rather
than genuine mental states. This position paper argues that the current
discourse conflates sophisticated pattern matching with authentic cognition,
missing a crucial distinction between simulation and experience. While recent
studies show LLMs achieving human-level performance on ToM laboratory tasks,
these results are based only on behavioral mimicry. More importantly, the
entire testing paradigm may be flawed in applying individual human cognitive
tests to AI systems, but assessing human cognition directly in the moment of
human-AI interaction. I suggest shifting focus toward mutual ToM frameworks
that acknowledge the simultaneous contributions of human cognition and AI
algorithms, emphasizing the interaction dynamics, instead of testing AI in
isolation.

### [208] ["It Felt Real" Victim Perspectives on Platform Design and Longer-Running Scams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02680)
*Jingjia Xiao,Qing Xiao,Hong Shen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文分析了长期诈骗（如恋爱诈骗和杀猪盘）如何利用数字平台的设计特征来建立信任和依赖，通过访谈25名中国受害者揭示了诈骗者如何策略性地使用平台功能进行可信度构建、亲密关系编排和持续胁迫。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测机制、威胁建模和用户漏洞，较少关注平台设计本身如何促成长期诈骗，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 对中国25名长期诈骗受害者进行深度访谈，分析诈骗者如何利用平台功能。

Result: 研究发现诈骗者策略性地利用平台功能（如专业资料验证、算法推荐、集成支付系统、私聊功能）来建立可信度、编排亲密关系和维持胁迫。

Conclusion: 通过将诈骗视为社会技术项目分析，强调了平台设计在长期诈骗中的被利用风险，并指出需要重新设计平台以更好地保护用户。

Abstract: Longer-running scams, such as romance fraud and "pig-butchering" scams,
exploit not only victims' emotions but also the design of digital platforms.
Scammers commonly leverage features such as professional-looking profile
verification, algorithmic recommendations that reinforce contact, integrated
payment systems, and private chat affordances to gradually establish trust and
dependency with victims. Prior work in HCI and criminology has examined online
scams through the lenses of detection mechanisms, threat modeling, and
user-level vulnerabilities. However, less attention has been paid to how
platform design itself enables longer-running scams. To address this gap, we
conducted in-depth interviews with 25 longer-running scam victims in China. Our
findings show how scammers strategically use platform affordances to stage
credibility, orchestrate intimacy, and sustain coercion with victims. By
analyzing scams as socio-technical projects, we highlight how platform design
can be exploited in longer-running scams, and point to redesigning future
platforms to better protect users.

*Yoojin Hong,Martina Di Paola,Braahmi Padmakumar,Hwi Joon Lee,Mahnoor Shafiq,Joseph Seering*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐喻的系统，帮助用户想象和探索新的社交媒体环境，通过将用户隐喻转化为平台功能并生成LLM驱动的交互模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社交媒体设计过于关注参与度和规模，研究人员提出的替代方案难以在平台限制内进行原型设计。

Method: 开发了隐喻驱动系统，将用户隐喻转化为结构化平台功能，并生成由LLM驱动的交互式模拟环境。通过用户研究评估该方法。

Result: 研究发现隐喻能让用户表达独特的社会期望，模拟的真实感取决于其对亲密性、参与度和时间参与等动态的捕捉程度。

Conclusion: 隐喻驱动的模拟可以成为原型设计替代社交架构的强大工具，扩展未来社交平台的设计空间。

Abstract: Social media platforms are central to communication, yet their designs remain
narrowly focused on engagement and scale. While researchers have proposed
alternative visions for online spaces, these ideas are difficult to prototype
within platform constraints. In this paper, we introduce a metaphor-driven
system to help users imagine and explore new social media environments. The
system translates users' metaphors into structured sets of platform features
and generates interactive simulations populated with LLM-driven agents. To
evaluate this approach, we conducted a study where participants created and
interacted with simulated social media spaces. Our findings show that metaphors
allow users to express distinct social expectations, and that perceived
authenticity of the simulation depended on how well it captured dynamics like
intimacy, participation, and temporal engagement. We conclude by discussing how
metaphor-driven simulation can be a powerful design tool for prototyping
alternative social architectures and expanding the design space for future
social platforms.

*Yoojin Hong,Yersultan Doszhan,Joseph Seering*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于分布式角色的新闻评论系统，通过让用户承担不同角色来协作构建评论结构，以促进更平衡、连接的讨论空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前新闻评论系统基于个体主义假设，导致碎片化和两极分化的对话，无法代表公共讨论的多样性。

Method: 采用受试者内混合方法评估（N=38），比较传统评论系统与基于分布式角色的系统。

Result: 新系统支持理解问题、协作构建评论和建设讨论三个阶段；评论显示更平衡的观点和情感中立论证，但论证强度有所降低。

Conclusion: 分布式角色在新闻评论系统设计中需要在包容性和深度之间权衡，提出了相关设计考虑。

Abstract: Current news commenting systems are designed based on implicitly
individualistic assumptions, where discussion is the result of a series of
disconnected opinions. This often results in fragmented and polarized
conversations that fail to represent the spectrum of public discourse. In this
work, we develop a news commenting system where users take on distributed roles
to collaboratively structure the comments to encourage a connected, balanced
discussion space. Through a within-subject, mixed-methods evaluation (N=38), we
find that the system supported three stages of participation: understanding
issues, collaboratively structuring comments, and building a discussion. With
our system, users' comments displayed more balanced perspectives and a more
emotionally neutral argumentation. Simultaneously, we observed reduced argument
strength compared to a traditional commenting system, indicating a trade-off
between inclusivity and depth. We conclude with design considerations and
trade-offs for introducing distributed roles in news commenting system design.

TL;DR: 提出了PromptMap交互式可视化系统，支持探索性文本到图像生成，通过新的视觉表示帮助用户在设计空间中导航和结构化探索过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型在创意任务中很有价值，但用户容易在广阔的设计空间中迷失，忘记已尝试和未尝试的内容，需要有效帮助来管理探索过程。

Method: 首先提出Design-Exploration模型形式化探索过程，然后创建PromptMap交互式可视化系统，采用新的视觉表示和直观交互帮助用户结构化探索可能性。

Result: 通过深入用户访谈评估系统，结果表明系统能更好地匹配探索过程的非线性特性，使其更易于理解和跟踪。

Conclusion: PromptMap系统通过创新的视觉表示和交互设计，有效支持用户在文本到图像生成过程中的探索性工作流程。

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models can be tremendously valuable in supporting
creative tasks by providing inspirations and enabling quick exploration of
different design ideas. However, one common challenge is that users may still
not be able to find anything useful after many hours and hundreds of images.
Without effective help, users can easily get lost in the vast design space,
forgetting what has been tried and what has not. In this work, we first propose
the Design-Exploration model to formalize the exploration process. Based on
this model, we create an interactive visualization system, PromptMap, to
support exploratory text-to-image generation. Our system provides a new visual
representation that better matches the non-linear nature of such processes,
making them easier to understand and follow. It utilizes novel visual
representations and intuitive interactions to help users structure the many
possibilities that they can explore. We evaluated the system through in-depth
interviews with users.

Method: 开发Tranquil Loom VR应用，包含四个环境中的伸展、引导冥想和开放探索活动，配备AI助手。采用两阶段混合方法研究：10名知识工作者访谈指导设计，35名参与者部署收集使用数据、健康指标和访谈。

Result: 结果显示正念水平提高，焦虑减少。参与者喜欢结构化和开放式活动，经常以玩乐方式使用应用。AI建议使用频率较低，但启发了未来个性化想法。

Conclusion: 参与者将VR视为灵活的"即插即用"工具，强调其在情境化而非规范性健康支持方面的价值。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly being used to support workplace
well-being, but many interventions focus narrowly on a single activity or goal.
Our work explores how VR can meet the diverse physical and mental needs of
knowledge workers. We developed Tranquil Loom, a VR app offering stretching,
guided meditation, and open exploration across four environments. The app
includes an AI assistant that suggests activities based on users' emotional
states. We conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study: (1) interviews with 10
knowledge workers to guide the app's design, and (2) deployment with 35
participants gathering usage data, well-being measures, and interviews. Results
showed increases in mindfulness and reductions in anxiety. Participants enjoyed
both structured and open-ended activities, often using the app playfully. While
AI suggestions were used infrequently, they prompted ideas for future
personalization. Overall, participants viewed VR as a flexible, ``drop-in''
tool, highlighting its value for situational rather than prescriptive
well-being support.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需额外训练的高效扩散模型采样算法，能够在8步内生成高质量512x512和1024x1024图像，性能优于现有ODE求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型ODE和SDE截断误差分析，开发无需训练的快速采样方法，解决高分辨率图像生成效率问题。

Method: 通过分析扩散ODE和SDE的截断误差，设计训练自由算法，支持灵活引导尺度，实现高效图像生成。

Result: 在COCO 2014、COCO 2017和LAION数据集上，8步生成的FID分别为15.7、22.35和17.52，优于DPM++ 2m和AMED-plugin求解器。5步生成性能与现有最佳方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需额外训练的情况下，实现了与最新蒸馏模型相当的生成质量和效率，为高效扩散模型采样提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an
image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation
process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation
or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation
error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free
algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight
steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our
algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8
steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation
model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also
generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than
the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We
validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO
2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and
17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further,
it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID
performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in
five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID
performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61,
respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED
Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the
state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We
also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps,
whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation
algorithm. The code is in repo:

Conclusion: 该分类法填补了点云可视化设计空间的空白，为未来开发更有效的可视化技术提供了系统指导。

Abstract: The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as
autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where
tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal
exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite
advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for
interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud
visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density
variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of
spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping
visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that
categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to
fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization
strategies based on data types, user objectives, and visualization techniques,
our framework provides a foundation for advancing more effective,
interpretable, and user-centered visualization techniques.

Conclusion: GS-Share实现了高保真度的3D地图共享，特别在外推视图方面表现优异，同时显著降低了传输开销。

Abstract: Constructing and sharing 3D maps is essential for many applications,
including autonomous driving and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian
splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction.
However, a practical map-sharing system that features high-fidelity, continuous
updates, and network efficiency remains elusive. To address these challenges,
we introduce GS-Share, a photorealistic map-sharing system with a compact
representation. The core of GS-Share includes anchor-based global map
construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update.
We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our
system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with
improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively.
Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission
overhead by 36%.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出一种基于简化超体积指标的自适应多目标进化算法，用于处理不规则Pareto前沿的优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定权重向量在处理不规则Pareto前沿（如退化、不连续、倒置等）时会导致解集分布不均匀甚至优化结果不佳。

Method: 基于MOEA/D框架，结合简化超体积指标评估解分布，使用R2指标动态调节权重向量更新频率。

Result: 与六种先进算法相比，所提算法表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法能够有效处理不规则Pareto前沿问题，通过自适应调整权重向量获得更好的优化结果。

Abstract: For regular Pareto Fronts (PFs), such as those that are smooth, continuous,
and uniformly distributed, using fixed weight vectors is sufficient for
multi-objective optimization approaches using decomposition. However, when
encountering irregular PFs-including degenerate, disconnected, inverted, etc.
Fixed weight vectors can often cause a non-uniform distribution of the sets or
even poor optimization results. To address this issue, this study proposes an
adaptive many-objective evolutionary algorithm with a simplified hypervolume
indicator. It synthesizes indicator assessment techniques with
decomposition-based methods to facilitate self-adaptive and dynamic adjustment
of the weight vectors in many-objective optimization methods. Specifically,
based on the MOEA/D framework, it uses a simplified hypervolume indicator to
accurately assess solution distribution. Simultaneously, applying the R2
indicator (as an approximation of hypervolume) dynamically regulates the update
frequency of the weight vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm is efficient and effective when compared with six
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot
paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater
spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction
capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment
similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the
scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates
with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion
planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or
augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing
users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot.
Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired
behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions
within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in
the real world.

Motivation: 现有的驾驶场景编辑框架由于编辑能力有限，难以高效生成真实场景。需要一种能够直观操作且支持精确编辑的方法。

Method: 使用语言对齐的高斯泼溅重建场景，支持自然语言提示的直观操作，通过多智能体运动预测进行路径精炼，实现对象级编辑和轨迹修改。

Conclusion: SIMSplat提供了一个高效且直观的驾驶场景编辑解决方案，能够生成真实的交互场景。

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

TL;DR: U-LAG是一个中执行目标重定向层，能够在感知延迟的情况下重新调整任务目标，而不改变底层控制器。核心贡献是UAR-PF不确定性感知重定向器，在感知延迟下维护物体位姿分布并选择最大化预期进展的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在变化环境中操作时，感知信息往往存在延迟、噪声或过时问题，需要在不改变底层控制器的情况下实时调整任务目标。

Method: 提出UAR-PF不确定性感知重定向器，维护物体位姿分布，选择最大化预期进展的目标。采用可插拔的重定向接口，在PyBullet/PandaGym中构建可复现的Shift x Lag压力测试。

Result: 在0-10cm位移和0-400ms延迟条件下，UAR-PF和ICP相比无重定向基线表现更优，成功率高，末端执行器移动距离小，中止次数少。操作安全措施进一步提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: U-LAG框架为感知延迟下的目标重定向提供了有效的解决方案，UAR-PF方法在多种操作任务中表现出良好的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

Conclusion: 提出的在线模仿学习框架能有效缓解数据覆盖限制，提高鲁棒性和泛化能力，减少微调过程中的性能下降

Abstract: We are interested in solving the problem of imitation learning with a limited
amount of real-world expert data. Existing offline imitation methods often
struggle with poor data coverage and severe performance degradation. We propose
a solution that leverages robot simulators to achieve online imitation
learning. Our sim-to-real framework is based on world models and combines
online imitation pretraining with offline finetuning. By leveraging online
interactions, our approach alleviates the data coverage limitations of offline
methods, leading to improved robustness and reduced performance degradation
during finetuning. It also enhances generalization during domain transfer. Our
empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness, improving success rates by at
least 31.7% in sim-to-sim transfer and 23.3% in sim-to-real transfer over
existing offline imitation learning baselines.

TL;DR: 提出基于Koopman算子的数据驱动模型预测控制框架，用于移动机器人在动态环境中的导航。通过双线性Koopman模型准确捕捉非线性状态-输入耦合和碰撞避免所需的二次项，比传统线性实现更有效。


<details>

Motivation: 传统Koopman方法仅关注系统动力学的线性化，而本文旨在为包含非线性机器人动力学和碰撞避免约束的最优路径规划问题寻找全局线性表示。

Method: 使用扩展动态模式分解从输入状态数据中识别线性和双线性Koopman实现，在提升空间中制定机器人路径规划的二次规划问题，并在MPC框架中确定最优机器人动作。

Result: 双线性Koopman模型能准确捕捉非线性状态-输入耦合和碰撞避免所需的二次项，而线性实现无法做到。该方法比在原始状态空间求解路径规划问题的非线性MPC快320倍。

Conclusion: 双线性Koopman实现对于具有非线性状态和输入约束的高度非线性最优控制问题的线性化具有潜力，能够实现与线性问题相似的计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the
linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global
linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SubSense是一个结合触觉反馈和VR控制界面的新型框架，用于提升水下ROV的远程操作性能，通过非侵入式反馈接口和VR平台改善传统2D相机操作缺乏沉浸感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ROV远程操作依赖低分辨率2D相机，缺乏沉浸式和感官反馈，在复杂海底环境中降低了态势感知能力。

Method: 提出SubSense框架，集成非侵入式反馈接口与单自由度机械臂，配合操作者手套提供触觉反馈和抓取状态，并开发端到端软件管理控制输入和通过VR平台显示沉浸式相机视图。

Result: 通过综合实验和用户研究验证了系统有效性，相比传统远程操作界面，在精细操作任务中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 多感官反馈在沉浸式虚拟环境中具有显著提升远程态势感知和任务性能的潜力，为现场ROV操作提供更直观和易用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual
environments to significantly improve remote situational awareness and mission
performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in the
field.

TL;DR: UMI-on-Air是一个框架，用于将手持夹爪收集的人类演示训练的通用视觉运动策略部署到受限机器人平台（如空中机械臂）上，通过结合高层策略和低层特定控制器实现动态可行的轨迹生成。

Motivation: 解决从手持夹爪收集的人类演示训练的策略在转移到受限机器人平台时，由于控制和机器人动力学不匹配导致的分布外行为和执行效果差的问题。

Method: 提出Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP)，将高层UMI策略与低层特定控制器在推理时耦合，通过控制器跟踪成本的梯度反馈引导扩散采样过程，生成针对部署平台的动态可行轨迹。

Result: 在多个长时程和高精度空中操作任务上验证了方法的有效性，相比无引导的扩散基线，提高了成功率、效率和抗干扰鲁棒性，并在未见环境中成功部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为在不同甚至高度受限的机器人平台上扩展通用操作技能提供了一条实用途径。

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly
released after acceptance. Result videos can be found at umi-on-air.github.io.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于动态环境的实时语义RGBD SLAM方法，通过深度学习语义信息检测移动物体并维护静态地图，在TUM数据集上实现了与最先进方法相当的定位精度，运行速度约22fps。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉SLAM方法大多基于静态世界假设，在动态环境中表现不佳。需要开发专门针对动态环境的SLAM系统，以提高在真实世界中的鲁棒性。

Method: 将深度学习语义信息集成到SLAM系统中，使用扩展卡尔曼滤波器识别暂时静止的动态物体，并采用生成网络填补动态物体区域的缺失信息。系统在ROS平台上实现，具有高度模块化架构。

Result: 在TUM数据集的动态序列上测试，定位误差与最先进方法相当，在GTX1080上运行速度约22fps，接近实时性能。

Conclusion: 提出的语义RGBD SLAM方法能够有效处理动态环境，通过语义信息显著减少动态物体的影响，同时保持实时性能，为动态环境下的机器人定位与建图提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on
dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach
delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, all while operating in near real-time. The source code is publicly
available.

Conclusion: 该算法能够在系统动力学未知甚至突变的情况下，保证系统安全地跟随分段线性轨迹。

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a
piecewise linear trajectory without prior knowledge of the system dynamics.
Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏能够在微处理器平台上通过无线网络执行多机器人编队导航的全面解决方案，特别是对于需要穿越复杂曲线路径的编队。

Method: 采用"hold-and-hit"通信控制框架，结合周期内优化方法，在离散时间通信控制周期内同步机器人运动，并考虑非完整运动约束。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够在具有网络延迟和数据包丢失的无线网络环境下，实现多机器人刚性编队的精确可靠导航。

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的轨迹生成框架，通过结构化网格表示和基于行为的生成机制，增强场景密度和行为多样性，解决现有数据集长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测数据集存在明显的长尾分布问题，大多数样本来自低密度场景和简单直行行为，缺乏高密度场景和安全关键操作（如变道、超车、转弯）的充分表示，这阻碍了模型泛化能力并导致过于乐观的评估。

Method: 将连续道路环境转换为结构化网格表示，支持细粒度路径规划、显式冲突检测和多智能体协调。在此基础上引入基于行为的生成机制，结合基于规则的决策触发、Frenet-based轨迹平滑和动态可行性约束。

Result: 在Argoverse 1和Argoverse 2数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著提高了智能体密度和行为多样性，同时保持了运动真实性和场景级安全性。合成数据还使下游轨迹预测模型受益，在挑战性高密度场景中提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够合成真实的高密度场景和复杂交互的罕见行为，填补了真实数据中的空白，为轨迹预测模型的训练和评估提供了更全面的数据支持。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了iLLM-A*算法，通过优化A*算法、增量学习方法和路径点选择机制，在网格地图路径规划中相比LLM-A*实现了1000倍以上的加速、最高58.6%的内存节省，以及更短的路径长度和更稳定的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径规划方法（如A*、Dijkstra）在大规模地图上搜索时间和内存消耗过高，而基于大语言模型的方法存在空间错觉和规划性能差的问题。LLM-A*虽然结合了LLM和A*，但在大规模地图上计算时间仍然很高。

Method: 设计了iLLM-A*算法，包含三个核心机制：1）A*算法优化；2）LLM增量学习方法生成高质量路径点；3）为A*路径规划选择适当的路径点。

Result: 在各种网格地图上的综合评估显示，相比LLM-A*，iLLM-A*实现了平均1000倍以上的加速，极端情况下最高2349.5倍加速；节省高达58.6%的内存成本；路径长度明显更短且标准差更低。

Conclusion: iLLM-A*通过精心设计的优化机制，在大规模网格地图路径规划中显著提升了性能，解决了LLM-A*的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过力信息仿真数据生成和顺应性策略的结合，能够有效提升视觉运动策略在接触丰富任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

Motivation: 工作区包含不规则布局、临时交通控制和动态变化的几何结构，现有视觉语言模型在这种复杂环境下的轨迹规划能力尚未被充分探索，存在大量失败案例需要解决。

Method: 提出REACT-Drive框架：1）通过子图挖掘和聚类分析识别失败模式；2）利用VLMs将先验失败案例转化为约束规则和可执行代码；3）使用RAG在新场景中检索相似模式来指导轨迹生成。

Conclusion: REACT-Drive通过结合VLMs和RAG技术，有效解决了工作区轨迹规划中的挑战，显著提升了规划准确性和效率，为自动驾驶系统在复杂环境中的部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

Motivation: 传统开环FES控制器使用固定刺激强度，存在过度刺激导致肌肉疲劳或刺激不足增加跌倒风险的问题。

Method: 开发闭环FES控制器，根据实时足尖间隙动态调整刺激强度，在健康参与者中诱导足下垂，比较闭环与开环控制器在不同行走条件下的效果。

Result: 闭环控制器在显著降低刺激强度的同时，保持了足够的足尖间隙，且不影响髋、膝、踝关节角度。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅匹配现有系统的有效性，还具备减少肌肉疲劳、提高长期用户舒适度和依从性的潜力。

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

Motivation: 6G网络支持分布式机器学习应用（如自动驾驶、工业机器人），但现有推测解码方法无法直接应用于行为克隆策略，因为每个动作都依赖于前一个动作更新后的观察状态。

Method: 动作偏差感知混合推理：草稿模型估计动作需要目标模型验证和校正的程度，选择性跳过服务器操作；推导路径偏差阈值来平衡传输率和推理性能。

Conclusion: 动作偏差感知方法有效解决了分布式ML推理中的延迟问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了通信和计算开销。

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

Motivation: 社会导航评估复杂且成本高，人工评估可靠但资源密集，而数值指标易于计算但缺乏标准。研究动机是探索数值指标是否能反映人类感知，从而减少对人工评估的依赖。

Method: 通过分析数值指标与人类中心评估之间的关系，识别潜在的相关性，探索定量指标是否能够充分代表人类主观评价。

Result: 研究发现当前数值指标能够捕捉机器人导航行为的某些方面，但重要的主观因素仍未被充分代表，需要开发新的指标。

Conclusion: 虽然现有数值指标在一定程度上有效，但仍不足以完全替代人类中心评估，需要开发新的指标来更好地反映人类主观感知。

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

Conclusion: 提出的最小配置摆荡机器人设计可行，连续控制策略能够有效处理机构限制，为后续跳跃运动奠定了能量积累基础。

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for estimating the position and
orientation of flexible manipulators undergoing vertical motion using multiple
inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth
data. The flexible links are modeled as a series of rigid segments, with joint
angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the
measurements, with its parameters optimized through particle swarm optimization
(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and
0.00024~rad for $y$, $z$, and $\theta$, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected

such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to
prior methods. The link to our code can be found

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界实验中进一步证实了有效性，证明了VLA模型在视觉导航中的潜力。

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉规划中表现出潜力，但难以进行精确的空间和长时推理；而PDDL规划器擅长形式化规划，但无法解释视觉输入。现有方法需要人工预定义领域文件或持续环境访问，限制了自主性。

Method: 提出VLMFP框架，包含两个VLM：SimVLM基于输入规则描述模拟动作后果，GenVLM通过比较PDDL和SimVLM执行结果来生成和迭代优化PDDL文件。

Result: 在6个网格世界领域测试中，SimVLM对可见和未见外观的场景描述准确率分别为95.5%和82.6%，动作序列模拟准确率分别为85.5%和87.8%，目标达成判断准确率分别为82.4%和85.6%。VLMFP对可见和未见外观的未见实例生成有效规划的比例分别为70.0%和54.1%。

Conclusion: VLMFP能够自主生成PDDL文件，实现了多层次的泛化能力：同一生成的PDDL领域文件适用于同一问题下的所有不同实例，且VLM能够泛化到具有不同外观和规则的问题。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:
