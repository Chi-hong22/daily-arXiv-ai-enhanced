Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过视觉流散模型特征和transformer聚合，实现了跨物种、跨视角、跨上下文的人类级别动作识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习模型在跨物种、跨视角、跨上下文情境下动作识别的泛化性不足问题，追求人类级别的动作识别健壮性

Method: 使用视觉流散模型(VDM)生成的特征，通过transformer进行聚合，采用基于流散过程早期时间步条件化的模型来强调语义信息而非像素级细节

Result: 在跨物种、跨视角、跨上下文三个泛化性测试标准上都达到了最先进水平，提升了机器动作识别的健壮性

Conclusion: 视觉流散模型特征聚合方法能够有效提升动作识别的泛化性能力，让机器动作识别更接近人类水平

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

*Yuiko Uchida,Ren Togo,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSIM是一个新的3D场景评估指标，专注于物体层面的感知评估，比现有指标更符合人类视觉感知


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标主要评估整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。受神经心理学启发，认为人类识别3D场景时主要关注单个物体

Method: 利用物体检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个物体的"物体性"，实现以物体为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更接近人类感知，并对近期3D重建和生成模型进行了标准化重新评估

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的3D场景评估框架，有助于明确该领域的技术进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法依赖事后过滤或通用对齐技术，无法在生成源头主动预防有害输出，对弱势群体造成风险。

Method: 提出PromptGuard框架，包含VulnGuard Prompt混合技术，整合少量样本、伦理思维链和自适应角色提示，采用多目标优化理论。

Result: 通过熵边界和帕累托最优性证明25-30%的分析性伤害减少，建立数学基础支持系统性实证研究。

Conclusion: 该框架为实时伤害预防创建了智能专家系统，为LLM安全提供了理论基础和实用解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Beta-SOD方法，通过Beta混合分布建模相似度分布来检测标签噪声，提升噪声环境下Re-ID性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-ID方法对标签噪声高度敏感，传统方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要鲁棒的噪声处理方案

Method: 采用孪生网络架构，结合Beta混合相似度异常检测(Beta-SOD)框架，使用二元交叉熵、对比和余弦嵌入损失联合优化

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: Beta-SOD在噪声Re-ID场景中表现出优异的鲁棒性和广泛适用性，为处理标签噪声提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net是一个用于ICA图像冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的端到端框架，通过多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，显著提升了分割和检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为诊断金标准需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像存在低对比度、高噪声和复杂细粒度血管结构等挑战，现有方法难以满足临床需求。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块(CASE)突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块(PHFP)通过小波分解细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: 在八个分割指标上均优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构增强和频域细节优化，有效解决了ICA图像血管分割和狭窄检测的挑战，为临床CAD诊断提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于MRI的自动化桌面组学和留存分析框架，通过SAMONAI三维分割算法和SurvAMINN留存分析模型，显著提高结肠盐脾转移的手术预后预测准确性，C指数提升10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠盐脾转移是常见的肝转移，手术切除是唯一治愈方法，但现有预后模型预测力不足，特别是多发性症例

Method: 开发了包含分割管道和框面组学管道的全自动框架：1）使用基础模型完善部分标注数据进行肝脏、脾脏和肝肝癢分割；2）提出SAMONAI三维快速分割算法；3）使用SurvAMINN自动编码器多实例神经网络进行留存分析

Conclusion: 该研究表明了自动化分割算法与框面组学留存分析的集成能够为结直肠盐脾转移提供准确、标注效率高且可解释性强的手术预后预测

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型学习到的视觉表示在何时以及如何出现分歧，发现一个模型生成而另一个模型不生成的视觉属性及其触发提示

Method: 引入CompCon进化搜索算法，发现模型输出中更普遍的视觉属性差异，建立自动化数据生成管道创建ID2数据集，与LLM和VLM基线方法比较

Conclusion: CompCon能有效发现生成模型间的视觉表示差异，为理解模型偏差和表示学习提供了新工具

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Conclusion: 该机器学习方法成功解决了无人机影像中云影和太阳耀光干扰问题，为准确估计水质参数提供了可靠的技术支持

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种结合卷积局部特征学习和Transformer全局注意力的混合架构，在小规模图像分类数据集上显著提升了性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在计算机视觉中表现出色，但在小数据集上缺乏局部特征提取能力，因为缺少局部性和平移等变性等归纳偏置

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，在分层移位窗口注意力中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet等多个基准测试中均取得性能提升，相比Swin Transformer分别提升2.17%、4.92%、0.10%、0.26%和4.47%

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，需要开发一个能够同时考虑局部和全局一致性的可微框架，以提高配准精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，通过双向源到目标和目标到源匹配进行重定位精炼，最后通过全局几何一致性学习预测点对匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到95%-97%的内点率，KITTI-360上94%-97%，3DMatch上最高81.1%，在多个基准测试中显著提升刚性配准性能。

Conclusion: iMatcher通过可微的局部和全局一致性学习框架，在室内外不同场景的点云配准任务中都表现出优异的性能和鲁棒性，达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用声学特征和创新的损失函数，为更准确的3D超声重建提供了有效途径，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using

faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用域自适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更精确的边界区分已知和未知类别。

Method: E-MLNet集成动态加权策略到开放集熵最小化(OEM)中，利用闭集分类器的预测，针对每个目标样本聚焦于最相关的类别边界。

Result: 在四个基准测试(Office-31、Office-Home、VisDA-2017、ImageCLEF)上取得最佳平均H分数，在大多数任务中优于MLNet基线。

Conclusion: 动态加权策略有效提升了通用域自适应的性能，证明了聚焦适应策略的优越性。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

TL;DR: 基于MS COCO创建的大规模乌尔都语图片描述数据集COCO-Urdu，包含5.9万张图片和31.9万条高质量乌尔都语描述，以帮助减少多模态视觉-语言模型中的语言偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为有超2.5亿使用者的主流语言，在多模态视觉-语言研究中很少获得支持，缺乏大规模高质量数据集导致了语言偏见问题

Method: 通过分层抽样从MS COCO数据集中选取图片，使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，构建混合多模态质量估计框架进行验证，包括COMET-Kiwi翻译质量、CLIP视觉基础相似性、BERTScore和反向翻译语义一致性，并使用开源大语言模型迭代精炼低分数描述

Result: 创建了目前公开最大的乌尔都语图片描述数据集，在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF指标上都获得了一致优异的结果

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu数据集和质量估计流程的发布将有助于减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为建立包容性的视觉-语言系统奠定基础

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression

aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

TL;DR: 通过提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)，在生成式滴涼框架中显式集成解剖学约束，生成更加解剖学可行的3D脑部MRI反事实图像，并验证了反事实图像能够复现疾病对直观脑区的细微影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实图像生成模型缺乏显式的解剖学偏置，无法保留细粒度的解剖学细节，而这些细节对医学研究很重要。MRI采集成本高，图像合成技术可以大大提升研究效率。

Method: 提出PCGM方法：1)通过概率图模块捐换解剖学约束；2)将约束转换为空间二进制掩码（使用3D ControlNet编码）；3)用掩码约束新题反事实去噪UNet；4)通过3D滴涼解码器生成高质量MRI。

Result: 在多个数据集上证明PCGM生成的结构脑部MRI质量更高。首次证明从PCGM生成的反事实图像中提取的脑部测量能够复现疾病对直观脑区的细微影响，这与神经科学文献中之前报告的结果一致。

Conclusion: PCGM方法是使用合成MRI研究细微形态差异的重要里程碑，通过显式集成解剖学约束，生成了解剖学可行的高质量反事实图像。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Motivation: 现有图卷积神经网络(GCN)在人体动作识别中表现优异，但在人物交互检测方面效果不佳，需要更有效地表示场景信息和学习架构

Method: 提出多任务学习方法，考虑环境中固定物体信息，使用交互区域信息，基于公共环境收集的真实数据集

Result: 识别交互和非交互动作的准确玉达到99.25%，较仅使用人体骨架姿势的基础模型提升2.75%

Conclusion: 多任务学习结合交互区域信息能够显著提升人体动作识别性能，特别是在人物交互检测任务中

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多渠道物体检测方法在特征融合过程中常常保留了多余的背景或噪声，限制了感知性能。需要一种能够自适应地增强显著结构、抑制共享背景干扰的方法。

Method: 提出IRDFusion框架，包含两个核心模块：互益特征精炼模块(MFRM)和差分特征反馈模块(DFFM)。MFRM通过建模内渠和渠间关系来改善特征表征；DFFM动态计算渠间差分特征作为指导信号进行反馈，形成迭代关系映射差分导向的特征融合机制。

Result: 在FLIR、LLVIP和M^3FD数据集上进行了涉及广泛的实验，IRDFusion达到了最先进的性能，并在多种具有挑战性的场景中一致超过现有方法，证明了其稳健性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的跨渠道特征对比和筛选策略，成功地解决了多渠道物体检测中的背景干扰问题，为高质量的跨渠道特征融合提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有VLA模型计算和内存成本过高，传统压缩方法无法同时实现量化和token剪枝，存在不兼容问题

Method: 提出新的量化感知token剪枝标准，在激进量化模型上工作，同时改进量化器设计以增强剪枝效果

Result: 在标准VLA模型上实现计算效率和推理速度显著提升，保持核心模型性能，获得1.93倍加速和4.5%平均成功率提升

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA成功解决了量化和token剪枝的不兼容问题，为VLA模型的实用部署提供了有效的加速解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Conclusion: 该框架特别适用于动态空对空环境中的可靠无人机感知，为开放集检测提供了一种模型无关的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort

Motivation: 基础分割模型在零样本情况下能够从顶视图作物图像中提取合理的叶子实例，但分割由多个重叠叶子组成的完整植物个体仍然具有挑战性。现有的层次分割方法通常需要物种特定的标注训练数据集，这需要大量人工劳动。

Method: 整合基础分割模型（提取叶子实例）和视觉语言模型（推理植物结构），无需额外训练即可提取植物个体。

Result: 在包含多个植物物种、生长阶段和拍摄环境的数据集上评估表明，该方法超越了现有的零样本方法，并且比监督方法具有更好的跨域性能。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一种有效的零样本植物个体分割解决方案，避免了传统方法对标注数据的依赖，在跨域场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first

Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

*Tianlu Zheng,Yifan Zhang,Xiang An,Ziyong Feng,Kaicheng Yang,Qichuan Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GA-DMS框架，通过数据筛选和模型架构改进来增强CLIP在行人表征学习中的性能，解决了数据稀缺和全局对比学习的局限性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在行人表征学习中面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模标注的行人中心视觉-语言数据，以及全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征且易受噪声文本标记影响。

Method: 1) 开发基于MLLM的噪声抵抗数据构建管道，自动筛选和标注网络图像，创建包含500万高质量行人图像-文本对的WebPerson数据集；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，通过梯度-注意力引导的双重掩码协同机制自适应掩码噪声文本标记；3) 引入掩码标记预测目标来增强细粒度语义表征学习。

Result: 大量实验表明，GA-DMS在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过数据筛选和模型架构的协同改进，成功提升了CLIP在行人表征学习中的表现，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

*Bin Huang,Kang Chen,Bingxuan Li,Huafeng Liu,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，并在多种PET任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标注数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1)Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2)正负掩码约束嵌入几何一致性；3)透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就实现了高质量的sinogram生成，性能可与大数据集训练的模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、灵活且可解释的基础模型框架，为医学影像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

TL;DR: 比较神经网络和持久同调在噪声环境下预测Betti数的性能，发现神经网络在噪声条件下表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络和持久同调这两种不同方法在从数据推断拓扑结构时的噪声鲁棒性

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，并与基于立方复形和符号欧几里得距离变换的持久同调方法进行比较

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，神经网络在噪声条件下优于持久同调方法

Conclusion: 神经网络通过学习训练数据中的上下文和几何先验，为拓扑估计提供了比持久同调更具竞争力的替代方案

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调查太过关注任务或模型家族，忽视了数据集对模型结构进化的结构性压力。本论文希望通过数据集驱动的视角，提供一个统一的视频理解框架。

Method: 采用数据集驱动的视角，分析运动复杂性、时间范围、层次组成和多模态丰富性等数据集特征对模型的归纳偏置要求。重新解释了从两流、3D CNN到序列、transformer和多模态基础模型等里程碑模型。

Result: 建立了一个统一的框架，将数据集、归纳偏置和架构结合起来，提供了实用的模型设计指南，帮助在可扩展性和任务需求之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 该调查不仅提供了全面的回顾，还为推进通用视频理解提供了预测性的路线图，通过统一的框架提升了对视频理解模型进化的理解。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023挑战赛通过提供多尺度重叠细胞和组织标注数据集，验证了细胞-组织相互作用理解对病理图像分析的重要性，参赛模型相比仅细胞检测基线F1分数提升达7.99。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习细胞检测模型难以模拟病理学家在不同放大倍数下观察全玻片图像的行为，缺乏多尺度重叠标注数据集阻碍了细胞-组织相互依赖语义的学习。

Method: 挑战赛收集了来自306个TCGA全玻片图像的673对标注数据，包含六个器官的重叠细胞检测和组织分割标注，分为训练、验证和测试集，参赛者开发了整合细胞-组织关系的模型。

Result: 顶级参赛模型在测试集上相比不包含细胞-组织关系的基线细胞检测模型，F1分数提升了高达7.99，显示出多尺度语义整合带来的显著性能改进。

Conclusion: 细胞-组织相互作用理解对于实现人类水平性能至关重要，多尺度语义整合能显著提升细胞检测性能，OCELOT挑战赛推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Motivation: 无人机图像中的目标检测面临小目标密集、尺度变化和遮挡等挑战，需要改进现有模型来处理这些问题。

Method: 1. 引入通道门控注意力上采样/下采样(AU/AD)机制的双路径系统；2. 在特征融合中采用CSP-PAC技术，使用并行空洞卷积处理局部和上下文信息。

Result: 新设计的neck结构在小目标和密集目标检测方面表现出优越性能，模型保持实时检测速度且不增加计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 本研究为实时检测系统中的特征编码设计提供了有效方法，特别适用于无人机图像中的目标检测任务。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

*Zhiyue Liu,Sihang Liu,Jinyuan Liu,Xinru Zhang*

TL;DR: 知识基础视觉问答（KB-VQA）新框架，通过知识聚焦减少噪声，提升回应准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接使用检索到的知识导致知识冗余和噪声，影响回答准确性

Method: 1）从图像-问题对中提取关键部分构建低噪声查询 2）使用大模型识别和提取有益回答的知识段落 3）仅在模型缺乏信心时才集成知识

Result: 广泛实验证明该框架超越了最先进方法

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架能够获取准确关键知识，有效减少知识冗余和噪声影响

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术在地物分类中具有重要应用价值，但高光谱图像存在波段多、维度高、光谱混合等特征冗余问题，需要更精细的分类方法

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱图像，提出CWSSNet框架，集成3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作

Result: 在余干县分类中取得mIoU 74.50%、mAcc 82.73%、mF1 84.94%的优异性能，在水体、植被和裸地分类中获得最高IoU，小样本训练条件下性能可靠

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架有效解决了高光谱图像特征冗余问题，突破了传统方法的性能瓶颈，具有良好的鲁棒性和小样本训练能力

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated

Motivation: 低光目标检测因图像质量退化而具有挑战性，现有方法要么使用有信息损失的RAW-RGB图像，要么采用复杂框架，需要更轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 将传统ISP流程解构为线性（传感器校准）和非线性（色调映射）子模块，作为可微分组件通过任务驱动损失优化；引入内容感知适应性和物理先验；设计自增强机制促进子模块协作。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在低光环境下以最少的参数超越了基于RGB和RAW的先进检测方法。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP提供了一种轻量级、自适应的端到端低光目标检测解决方案，通过优化ISP流程显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Conclusion: 多粒度建模能有效提升目标引导轨迹预测性能，递归精炼和特征整合策略是成功的关键。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Motivation: 当前医学影像的上下文学习模型存在两个关键局限：无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖理解，且缺乏跨多种任务和解剖区域的统一模型，限制了上下文学习在医学影像中的潜力。

Method: 采用多尺度自回归上下文学习框架，从粗到细逐步优化预测，生成全分辨率体积输出；提出块状交叉注意力模块，在保持计算效率的同时促进上下文与目标输入之间的长程交互。

Result: 在涵盖未见临床中心、器官、物种和成像模态的广泛测试数据集上，Medverse显著优于现有基线方法，建立了上下文学习的新范式。

Conclusion: Medverse展示了上下文学习在医学影像分析中的巨大潜力，为通用医学图像处理提供了有效的解决方案，代码和模型权重已公开。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available
at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对全景X射线图像的大规模多模态指令数据集MMOral和评估基准MMOral-Bench，并开发了OralGPT模型，在牙科专业领域显著提升了LVLM的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在牙科等专业领域的有效性尚未充分探索，全景X射线图像由于密集解剖结构和细微病理线索而存在解释挑战，缺乏专门的医学基准和指令数据集

Method: 构建包含20,563张标注图像和130万指令实例的MMOral数据集，涵盖属性提取、报告生成、视觉问答和图像对话等任务类型；基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B进行监督微调开发OralGPT模型

Result: 评估64个LVLM发现最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到41.45%准确率；OralGPT经过单轮SFT后性能提升24.73%，显著改善了牙科领域的多模态AI能力

Conclusion: MMOral和OralGPT为智能牙科提供了重要基础，有望推动牙科领域更具临床影响力的多模态AI系统发展

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

*Chao Yuan,Yang Yang,Yehui Yang,Zach Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DATE方法，通过时间戳注入机制和语义引导的时间感知采样策略，增强多模态大语言模型的长视频时序理解能力，在7B和72B模型上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长视频中的长距离依赖关系，导致关键信息丢失和时序理解能力下降。

Method: DATE方法包含时间戳注入机制(TIM)和时序感知相似性采样(TASS)：1)将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳标记交错构建连续时序参考系统；2)将视频采样重新定义为视觉-语言检索任务，采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时序覆盖。

Result: 在小时级长视频基准测试中取得了显著改进，特别是在绝对时间理解和关键事件定位方面。7B模型甚至在某些基准上超越了多个72B模型。

Conclusion: DATE方法有效解决了长视频理解中的时序建模问题，通过显式时间参考和语义引导采样策略，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的时序推理能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

TL;DR: PSP-Seg是一个渐进式剪枝框架，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失实现动态高效的3D医学图像分割，在保持性能的同时大幅降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割资源消耗大、现有高效模型静态设计缺乏适应性、难以平衡性能与效率的问题。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块。

Result: 轻量版PSP-Seg-S在五个数据集上与nnU-Net性能相当，GPU内存减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是成本效益高且性能优异的替代方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

TL;DR: 通过学习视觉可程序性，让VLM动态选择代码思维（CaT）或直接视觉推理路径，仧双奖励系统培养准确性和决策能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图表理解中现有方法的限制：外部工具方案弱点多且受限，专家模型只采用单一推理策略，文本链式推理中间步骤难以验证

Method: 提出代码作为思维（CaT）方法，将图表信息转换为可验证的符号格式；引入视觉可程序性概念，让VLM学习选择代码路径或直接视觉推理；使用双奖励系统（数据准确奖励+决策奖励）进行强化学习

Result: 在多样化图表理解测试集上表现出艰固且稳定的性能

Conclusion: VLMs不仅可以学习如何推理，还能动态选择每个任务的最优推理路径，为图表理解领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态脑MRI分割模型要么局限于固定模态，要么在泛化到新模态时丢失模态特异性信息，需要开发能够处理任意可用成像模态的模型

Method: 对U-net架构进行简单修改，集成模态无关输入通道和模态特定输入通道，通过图像增强方案合成人工MRI模态来训练模态无关组件

Result: 在包含5种病理类型和8种MRI模态的8个数据库上评估，结果显示该方法既能有效处理训练时见过的模态，也能处理未见过的模态来改进分割

Conclusion: 通过简单的架构修改和图像增强技术，可以实现对任意MRI模态的脑部病变分割，提高了模型的实用性和泛化能力

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一个针对SAR图像的目标中心学习框架，无需掩码标注即可将目标表征与背景杂波分离，通过多级特征提取和注意力机制实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的复杂背景杂波（包括地形反射和斑点噪声）与目标具有相似的强度和模式，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级槽注意力模块整合高低级特征，增强槽级表征区分度。

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像中实现了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征融合和注意力机制，有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波分离的挑战，无需掩码标注即可获得清晰的目标表征。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Conclusion: 现有MLLMs对真实材料表征场景的适应性有限，MatCha基准将促进新材料发现和自主科学代理等领域的未来研究。

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Conclusion: PHCP成功证明了在推理时直接处理异构协作感知问题的可行性，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型中语言和视觉推理方式具有互补性，通过简单的无学习融合方法即可利用这种互补性来提高图像识别的准确性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术技能评估(SSA)面临技能标注稀缺的挑战，少样本学习(FSL)提供了可扩展的解决方案，但预训练策略在SSA中尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 将SSA构建为少样本任务，评估不同预训练源在三种少样本设置下的表现，量化领域相似性并分析领域差距和特定手术数据纳入预训练的影响。

Result: 领域相关的小数据集在1-shot、2-shot和5-shot设置下分别达到60.16%、66.03%和73.65%的准确率。加入特定手术数据可使准确率平均提升1.22%，F1分数提升2.28%。

Conclusion: 预训练源与目标任务的领域相关性比数据规模更重要，适当整合特定手术数据能显著提升少样本SSA性能，但领域不匹配的大规模数据反而可能导致性能下降。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了PnP方法与DDIM在解决不适定逆问题（特别是单像素成像）中的联系，提出了一个统一框架将学习先验与物理前向模型结合，并设计了混合数据一致性模块来提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PnP方法和扩散模型之间的联系，特别是在不适定逆问题中的应用，旨在整合学习先验和物理模型来提升单像素成像的重建性能。

Method: 将扩散过程解耦为三个可解释阶段：去噪、数据一致性强制和采样；提出混合数据一致性模块，线性组合多个PnP式保真项，直接在去噪估计上应用混合校正。

Result: 在单像素成像任务上的实验结果表明，该方法获得了更好的重建质量。

Conclusion: 通过统一框架整合学习先验和物理模型，并采用混合数据一致性校正，能够在不破坏扩散采样轨迹的情况下改善测量一致性，从而提升重建性能。

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种全自动两阶段框架，通过超声视频处理和临床数据融合来无创评估颅内压，显著提高了准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内压升高对脑功能构成严重威胁，需要监测以便及时干预。虽然腰椎穿刺是金标准，但其侵入性和相关风险推动了无创替代方案的需求。视神经鞘直径(ONSD)是一个有前景的生物标志物，但当前临床测量方法存在操作不一致、主观性强和阈值变异等问题

Method: 开发了一个全自动两阶段框架：1)眼底超声视频处理阶段进行帧级解剖分割、基于国际共识声明的规则关键帧识别和精确ONSD测量；2)颅内压分级阶段融合ONSD指标与临床特征来预测ICP等级

Result: 验证准确率达到0.845±0.071(五折交叉验证标准差)，独立测试准确率为0.786，显著优于传统基于阈值的方法(验证准确率0.637±0.111，测试准确率0.429)

Conclusion: 通过有效减少操作者变异性和整合多源信息，该框架建立了一种可靠的无创临床ICP评估方法，有望改善急性神经系统疾病患者的治疗管理

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

TL;DR: 一种无监督的IC缺陷分割框架，通过从测试图像中提取正常特征并重建正常内容，利用重建残差进行缺陷分割，免需外部正常数据支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IC缺陷分割方法依赖外部正常数据库，但IC图像布局差异性大且对准困难，导致方法脆弱。缺陷通常是局部的，而每张图像中仍包含丰富的正常模式。

Method: 设计可学习的正常信息提取器从测试图像中聚合代表性正常特征，通过一致性损失确保它们与正常区域关联。在这些特征指导下，解码器重建仅正常内容，利用重建残差进行缺陷分割。使用伪异常增帽稳定训练。

Result: 在三个IC制造过程段的数据集上进行实验，结果表明该方法在现有方法基础上持续改进，并且对产品变异性具有强壁随性。

Conclusion: 该无监督IC缺陷分割框架能够有效地分离缺陷，免需外部正常数据支持，适应不同产品的布局变化，为IC制造业提供了更稳健的缺陷检测解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Motivation: 医学VLMs在分布偏移下的可靠性是临床部署的主要问题，模型容易学习到任务无关的相关性，限制了其可推广性并增加了实际应用中失败的风险。

Method: 使用参数高效调整(LoRA)和可学习提示标记显式分离临床相关信号与任务无关噪音，并通过为多样化医学数据集生成高质量的图像-文本对来增强跨模态对齐。

Result: 在分布内性能提升+11.4% Top-1准确率和+3.3% Macro-F1，同时在未见数据集上保持强劲的稳健性。解耦临床相关特征和谨慎对齐显著提升了模型演进性并减少域偏移下的不可预测行为。

Conclusion: DRiFt框架为构建更安全、可信赖的临床VLMs提供了重要见解，通过特征解耦和跨模态对齐有效提升了模型在分布偏移下的可靠性。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Conclusion: FS-Diff通过扩散模型和语义引导机制，成功解决了多模态图像融合与超分辨率的联合任务，在保持细节和语义信息方面表现出色，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流图像级自监督学习方法在密集表示学习中出现过分散现象，即同一实例/类别的补丁分散，影响下游密集任务性能。研究发现图像级SSL通过隐式语义集中避免此问题，但这种方法不适用于空间敏感的密集SSL。

Method: 1. 通过补丁对应蒸馏打破严格空间对齐；2. 提出噪声容忍排序损失（扩展AP损失到连续目标）；3. 设计对象感知过滤器，通过交叉注意力将输出空间映射到基于对象的空间。

Result: 在各种任务上的实证研究有力地支持了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的显式语义集中方法成功解决了密集自监督学习中的过分散问题，通过创新的补丁对应蒸馏、噪声容忍损失和对象感知机制，显著提升了密集表示学习性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional

improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Conclusion: 动量约束提供了一种物理基础的方法来关联局部关节行为与全局位移，有效解决了局部与全局运动耦合的建模问题

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Motivation: 解决多视图融合中存在的低质量问题，包括噪声数据污染和缺失数据两种情况

Method: 提出随机生成扩散融合(SGDF)方法，利用多生成机制处理每个样本的多视图特征；基于SGDF进一步提出生成扩散对比网络(GDCN)

Result: 大量实验表明GDCN在深度多视图聚类任务中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: SGDF方法对低质量数据具有鲁棒性，GDCN网络在多视图聚类中表现出优异性能

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: DualTrack是一种新颖的双编码器架构，通过解耦的局部和全局编码器专门处理不同尺度的特征提取，用于从2D超声图像序列估计3D探头轨迹，在大型公共基准测试中实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，限制了其广泛应用。传感器无关的3D超声使用深度学习从2D图像序列估计探头轨迹，但现有方法要么忽略全局特征，要么将其与局部特征提取紧密耦合，无法稳健地建模这两个互补方面。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像骨干网络（如2D CNN或基础模型）和时间注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖关系；轻量级融合模块结合这些特征来估计轨迹。

Result: 在大型公共基准测试中，DualTrack实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的3D重建，优于先前方法，平均重建误差低于5毫米。

Conclusion: DualTrack通过解耦的局部和全局特征提取，有效解决了传感器无关3D超声中的轨迹估计问题，为低成本3D超声成像提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限情况下实现生物学信息图像生成，提供考虑机制先验的生成式时空预测，能够捕捉临床相关的肿瘤生长范围和方向性。

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性之间实现了最佳平衡，为大规模VFM适应实际遥感变化检测应用提供了强大且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar是一个新颖的级联框架，通过多模态指令理解和照片级真实感人像生成，解决了现有音频驱动虚拟人视频生成方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将指令条件仅视为由声学或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，而没有对指令传达的交流目的进行建模，这限制了叙事连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）导演生成蓝图视频，控制高级语义如角色动作和情感；第二阶段通过首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段，实现全局到局部的细节保留。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长达1080p和48fps的长时视频，在唇同步准确性、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础的高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成设立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Conclusion: HumbleBench填补了当前评估套件的关键空白，为安全关键环境中的MLLM可靠性提供了更现实的衡量标准

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

Conclusion: 通过统一的重建框架可以实现多模态理解与生成的深度协同，为统一多模态模型开启了新的研究方向

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Motivation: 解决AI辅助游戏开发中从设计到实现的转换问题，通过自动化流程提高开发效率

Method: 细调LLaMA-3模型专门用于Unity代码生成，结合自定义Unity集成包，实现从GDD解析到代码生成的端到端系统

Result: 在编译成功率、GDD遵循度、最佳实践和代码模块化等指标上超过现有LLM，平均评分4.8/5.0，支持多游戏类型

Conclusion: 该框架有效填补了AI辅助游戏开发的关键空白，使LLM成为从游戏设计到实现过渡的有力工具

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large
Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an end-to-end system that parses GDDs,
extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game
design to implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述向MiniZinc模型的转换需要逻辑推理和约束编程专业知识，这个过程很具挑战性

Method: 采用多代理模型框架，每个专门的LLM代理负责检测和生成特定类型全局约束的代码，最后由一个组装代理整合成完整的MiniZinc模型

Result: 初步实验显示该方法在多个LLM上都表现出更优的性能，超过了单次提示和思维链提示等基准方法

Conclusion: 通过任务分解和专门化代理的方式可以有效降低MiniZinc建模的复杂性，并为未来工作指明了改进方向

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成数据在AI训练中的比例不断增加，模型崩溃现象成为关键挑战。现有缓解策略有限，需要新的方法来保持生成模型质量

Method: 识别模型对自生成数据的过度自信是崩溃的关键驱动因素，提出置信度感知的损失函数TCE，在训练中降低高置信度预测的权重

Result: TCE显著延迟了递归训练中的模型崩溃，将模型崩溃前的保真度间隔延长了2.3倍以上，且方法在不同模态上具有通用性

Conclusion: 损失函数设计为在合成数据时代保持生成模型质量提供了简单而强大的工具

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Motivation: 随着协调任务趋向自动化，需要评估不仅是自治代理的绩效，还包括它们在多代理环境中的协商过程和行为动态

Method: 在动态协商环境中对人类(N=216)、LLMs(GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro)和贝叶斯代理进行直接对比，捕获结果和行为动态数据

Result: 贝叶斯代理通过敌对性优化获得最高剩余，但拒绝交易频繁；人类和LLMs能达到相似总体效益，但行为不同：LLMs偏向保守、进退的交易，人类更具战略性、冒险性和公平性

Conclusion: 绩效平等的标准可能隐藏了过程和对齐方面的根本差异，这对实际部署至关重要

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Motivation: 当前可解释AI研究中，不确定性解释和全局解释往往被忽视，需要构建通用的XAI指导原则，并验证算法在提供直观视觉理解方面的效果。

Method: 选择能够同时涵盖不确定性、鲁棒性和全局XAI概念的算法，测试其信任校准能力，并评估复杂但直观的可视化方法对用户满意度和可解释性的影响。

Result: 研究发现，尽管算法理解起来较为复杂，但旨在提供更直观视觉理解的算法能够带来更高的用户满意度和更好的人类可解释性。

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文条件提示的方法来优化冷启动用户的推荐系统，通过少量样本的LLM提示工程显著提升了推荐精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中冷启动用户因缺乏历史行为信息而导致的推荐效果不佳问题，探索在低数据环境下利用LLM进行有效推荐的方法。

Method: 采用上下文条件提示公式P(u, Ds)→R̂，其中u是冷启动用户档案，Ds是精选支持集，R̂是预测的排名项目列表。使用基于transformer的自回归LLM（BioGPT、LLaMA-2、GPT-4），通过令牌级对齐和嵌入空间正则化实现语义保真度。

Result: 实验证明最优示例注入和指令结构能显著提高precision@k和NDCG分数，特别是在低数据设置下。提示组合不仅影响语法结构，还能直接控制注意力规模和解码器行为。

Conclusion: 基于提示的适应方法可被视为解决LLM管道中冷启动推荐问题的有效途径之一，展示了提示工程在推荐系统中的重要价值。

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Result: 在INTERACTION多智能体预测基准中排名第一，在Argoverse 2多世界预测基准中也取得优异表现

Conclusion: ProgD方法通过显式建模动态交互关系，显著提升了多智能体运动预测的准确性和一致性

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), Multi-agent
Systems (MAS) have achieved significant progress in various application
scenarios. However, substantial challenges remain in designing versatile,
robust, and efficient platforms for agent deployment. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{LightAgent}, a lightweight yet powerful agentic
framework, effectively resolving the trade-off between flexibility and
simplicity found in existing frameworks. LightAgent integrates core
functionalities such as Memory (mem0), Tools, and Tree of Thought (ToT), while
maintaining an extremely lightweight structure. As a fully open-source
solution, it seamlessly integrates with mainstream chat platforms, enabling
developers to easily build self-learning agents. We have released LightAgent at

TL;DR: 该论文研究锦标赛中获胜者的可解释性认证，提出最小支持子锦标赛的概念，为各种锦标赛规则提供简洁的获胜原因解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锦标赛模型广泛用于表示候选者之间的成对优势关系，但缺乏对获胜者为何获胜的认证解释方法，这在可解释AI中很重要。

Method: 识别最小支持子锦标赛，即候选者在该子锦标赛中无论其余比赛结果如何都必然获胜的最小子集。针对多种锦标赛规则设计多项式时间算法计算最小支持。

Result: 确定了各种规则下最小支持的大小，为除加权无覆盖集外的所有规则提供了多项式时间算法，证明加权无覆盖集问题是NP完全的。

Conclusion: 最小支持子锦标赛能够产生紧凑、认证且直观的解释，为锦标赛获胜者的可解释性提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

TL;DR: 研究空间协调三个维度（探索多样性、移动专业化、自适应空间接近度）对限制显性沟通的团队协作搜救任务绩效的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多团队（消防员、军事、执法、应急响应）需要在没有视觉线索或广泛显性沟通的情况下协调物理空间中的移动，但现有研究主要关注同地同步团队或知识工作协调

Method: 分析34个四人团队（136名参与者）在搜救任务中的空间接近度、分布模式和移动对齐等空间协调指标数据

Result: 空间专业化正向预测绩效，自适应空间接近度呈现边际倒U型关系（适度适应最优），这些指标的时序动态能区分高低绩效团队

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基于角色的团队工作中隐性空间协调的重要性，强调了平衡自适应策略的价值，对培训和AI辅助团队支持系统具有启示意义

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在任务覆盖、领域多样性、难度建模和评估严谨性方面存在局限，无法充分评估LLM代理在真实环境中的端到端ML工作流能力

Method: 1) 基于浏览器自动化和LLM的任务采集系统从Kaggle等平台收集结构化ML挑战；2) 基于排行榜的难度建模机制；3) 包含性能、格式合规性、约束遵循和任务泛化的多维度评估框架

Result: 构建了包含150个AutoML任务的基准测试，分为Lite(18任务)、Medium和Full三个版本，其中Lite版本在模态和难度级别上具有平衡覆盖

Conclusion: TAM Bench提供了一个全面、可扩展的基准测试，能够更好地评估LLM代理在端到端机器学习工作流中的真实能力

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种将通用语义推理嵌入自主代理的实用可扩展方法，为实现完全智能自主导航探索提供了新方向

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Method: 提出Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO)方法，引导模型利用内部推理能力生成适当响应，无需手动构建few-shot示例

Result: 实验结果表明TORSO在多样化LLMs基准测试中实现了强劲性能，并生成合理的推理过程

Conclusion: TORSO是一种有效的推理引导方法，能够充分利用LLMs的内在推理能力，在多种任务上实现优异性能且无需人工few-shot示例

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期多智能体系统产生大量轨迹和交互历史，现有内存管理方法存在噪声积累、内存膨胀和跨域泛化能力有限的问题，需要更高效的内存管理机制。

Method: SEDM框架包含三个核心组件：基于可重现回放的可验证写入准入、根据经验效用动态排序和整合条目的自调度内存控制器、以及抽象可重用见解支持跨异构任务迁移的跨域知识扩散。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，SEDM相比强内存基线提高了推理准确性并降低了token开销，能够将从事实验证中提取的知识用于增强多跳推理。

Conclusion: SEDM被证明是一个可扩展且可持续的内存机制，适用于开放式的多智能体协作系统。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

Method: 将组合张量模型表示解释在希尔伯特空间中，训练变分量子电路学习这些表示，使用两种图像编码技术：多热编码和CLIP图像向量的角度/幅度编码

Result: 使用噪声多热编码获得良好的概念验证结果，在CLIP图像向量上表现参差不齐但仍优于经典组合模型

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化任务中具有潜力，特别是在多热编码方案下表现良好，为量子AI在组合语义处理中的应用提供了初步证据

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Result: 实验结果显示，Auras平均将吞吐量提高了2.54倍，同时达到原始准确性的102.7%，证明了其在克服顺序计算约束和提供高吞吐量方面的有效性。

Conclusion: Auras通过算法-系统协同设计成功解决了具身AI系统中感知和生成模块的高频推理需求，在显著提升吞吐量的同时保持了系统准确性，为实时具身AI应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，大语言模型在长任务执行中存在执行错误而非推理能力不足的问题，模型规模扩展对单步准确率的边际提升能带来任务完成长度的指数级改善，但存在自我条件效应限制长任务执行能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型规模扩展是否带来收益递减，研究模型在长任务中失败的原因（执行错误vs推理能力不足），以及单步准确率提升如何影响任务完成长度。

Method: 通过提供明确的知识和计划来隔离执行能力，测试不同规模模型在多步任务中的表现，分析错误模式和自我条件效应，对比思考模型与传统LLMs的表现。

Result: 大模型即使在小模型100%单步准确率的情况下也能正确执行更多步骤；模型单步准确率随步骤增加而下降，存在自我条件效应（上下文中的先前错误会增加后续错误概率）；思考模型不受自我条件效应影响，能执行更长的单步任务。

Conclusion: 执行能力而非推理能力是长任务失败的主要原因；模型规模扩展和序列测试时计算对长视野任务有巨大益处；思考模型能避免自我条件效应，在单步中执行更长任务。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: 综合考虑行为因素的流行病模型能更准确地描述现实疫情发展，最优控制方法可为政府制定多目标平衡的公共卫生干预策略提供科学依据。

Abstract: We propose and study a compartmental model for epidemiology with human
behavioral effects. Specifically, our model incorporates governmental
prevention measures aimed at lowering the disease infection rate, but we split
the population into those who comply with the measures and those who do not
comply and therefore do not receive the reduction in infectivity. We then allow
the attitude of noncompliance to spread as a social contagion parallel to the
disease. We derive the reproductive ratio for our model and provide stability
analysis for the disease-free equilibria. We then propose a control scenario
wherein a policy-maker with access to control variables representing disease
prevention mandates, treatment efforts, and educational campaigns aimed at
encouraging compliance minimizes a cost functional incorporating several cost
concerns. We characterize optimal controls via the Pontryagin optimality
principle and present simulations which demonstrate the behavior of the control
maps in several different parameter regimes.

Abstract: Cyber warfare has become a central element of modern conflict, especially
within multi-domain operations. As both a distinct and critical domain, cyber
warfare requires integrating defensive and offensive technologies into coherent
strategies. While prior research has emphasized isolated tactics or fragmented
technologies, a holistic understanding is essential for effective resource
deployment and risk mitigation. Game theory offers a unifying framework for
this purpose. It not only models attacker-defender interactions but also
provides quantitative tools for equilibrium analysis, risk assessment, and
strategic reasoning. Integrated with modern AI techniques, game-theoretic
models enable the design and optimization of strategies across multiple levels
of cyber warfare, from policy and strategy to operations, tactics, and
technical implementations. These models capture the paradoxical logic of
conflict, where more resources do not always translate into greater advantage,
and where nonlinear dynamics govern outcomes. To illustrate the approach, this
chapter examines RedCyber, a synthetic cyber conflict, demonstrating how
game-theoretic methods capture the interdependencies of cyber operations. The
chapter concludes with directions for future research on resilience,
cros-echelon planning, and the evolving role of AI in cyber warfare.

Abstract: We study a Bayesian persuasion setting in which a sender wants to persuade a
critical mass of receivers by revealing partial information about the state to
them. The homogeneous binary-action receivers are located on a communication
network, and each observes the private messages sent to them and their
immediate neighbors. We examine how the sender's expected utility varies with
increased communication among receivers. We show that for general families of
networks, extending the network can strictly benefit the sender. Thus, the
sender's gain from persuasion is not monotonic in network density. Moreover,
many network extensions can achieve the upper bound on the sender's expected
utility among all networks, which corresponds to the payoff in an empty
network. This is the case in networks reflecting a clear informational
hierarchy (e.g., in global corporations), as well as in decentralized networks
in which information originates from multiple sources (e.g., influencers in
social media). Finally, we show that a slight modification to the structure of
some of these networks precludes the possibility of such beneficial extensions.
Overall, our results caution against presuming that more communication
necessarily leads to better collective outcomes.

Result: 当z≥n/2时，任何策略证明机制都无法获得有界近似比。对于平均主义成本，选择第(z+1)顺序统计量是策略证明且2-近似的，且这是最优的。对于功利主义成本，策略证明机制无法有效利用异常值，近似保证随异常值数量增加而恶化。

Conclusion: 带异常值的机制设计表现出反直觉的特性，丢弃异常值不一定改善效率。预测信息的引入在功利主义目标下能实现最优的一致性-鲁棒性权衡，但在平均主义目标下即使有预测也无法突破下界。

Abstract: We initiate the study of mechanism design with outliers, where the designer
can discard $z$ agents from the social cost objective. This setting is
particularly relevant when some agents exhibit extreme or atypical preferences.
As a natural case study, we consider facility location on the line: $n$
strategic agents report their preferred locations, and a mechanism places a
facility to minimize a social cost function. In our setting, the $z$ agents
farthest from the chosen facility are excluded from the social cost. While it
may seem intuitive that discarding outliers improves efficiency, our results
reveal that the opposite can hold.
  We derive tight bounds for deterministic strategyproof mechanisms under the
two most-studied objectives: utilitarian and egalitarian social cost. Our
results offer a comprehensive view of the impact of outliers. We first show
that when $z \ge n/2$, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve a bounded
approximation for either objective. For egalitarian cost, selecting the $(z +
1)$-th order statistic is strategyproof and 2-approximate. In fact, we show
that this is best possible by providing a matching lower bound. Notably, this
lower bound of 2 persists even when the mechanism has access to a prediction of
the optimal location, in stark contrast to the setting without outliers. For
utilitarian cost, we show that strategyproof mechanisms cannot effectively
exploit outliers, leading to the counterintuitive outcome that approximation
guarantees worsen as the number of outliers increases. However, in this case,
access to a prediction allows us to design a strategyproof mechanism achieving
the best possible trade-off between consistency and robustness. Finally, we
also establish lower bounds for randomized mechanisms that are truthful in
expectation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible items to $n$ agents to maximize
the utilitarian social welfare, where the fairness criterion is envy-free up to
one item and there are only two different utility functions shared by the
agents. We present a $2$-approximation algorithm when the two utility functions
are normalized, improving the previous best ratio of $16 \sqrt{n}$ shown for
general normalized utility functions; thus this constant ratio approximation
algorithm confirms the APX-completeness in this special case previously shown
APX-hard. When there are only three agents, i.e., $n = 3$, the previous best
ratio is $3$ shown for general utility functions, and we present an improved
and tight $\frac 53$-approximation algorithm when the two utility functions are
normalized, and a best possible and tight $2$-approximation algorithm when the
two utility functions are unnormalized.

Abstract: Accurate acoustic simulations of enclosed spaces require precise boundary
conditions, typically expressed through surface impedances for wave-based
methods. Conventional measurement techniques often rely on simplifying
assumptions about the sound field and mounting conditions, limiting their
validity for real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this study
introduces a Bayesian framework for the in situ estimation of
frequency-dependent acoustic surface impedances from sparse interior sound
pressure measurements. The approach employs simulation-based inference, which
leverages the expressiveness of modern neural network architectures to directly
map simulated data to posterior distributions of model parameters, bypassing
conventional sampling-based Bayesian approaches and offering advantages for
high-dimensional inference problems. Impedance behavior is modeled using a
damped oscillator model extended with a fractional calculus term. The framework
is verified on a finite element model of a cuboid room and further tested with
impedance tube measurements used as reference, achieving robust and accurate
estimation of all six individual impedances. Application to a numerical car
cabin model further demonstrates reliable uncertainty quantification and high
predictive accuracy even for complex-shaped geometries. Posterior predictive
checks and coverage diagnostics confirm well-calibrated inference, highlighting
the method's potential for generalizable, efficient, and physically consistent
characterization of acoustic boundary conditions in real-world interior
environments.

Motivation: 解决基于自监学习模型的音频深度伪造检测中全量微调计算成本高的问题，尝试通过参数高效学习方法在保持性能的同时降低训练成本

Method: 提出MoLEx框架，结合Low-Rank Adaptation和Mixture-of-Experts路由器，仅微调选择的专家模块，保留领先训练知识，同时支持域适应性扩展

Result: 在ASVSpoof 5数据集上达到独立领域最佳性能，评估集上无增强的等误率为5.56%，路由器能够根据攻击类型激活相应专家

Conclusion: MoLEx框架通过参数高效学习方式有效解决了音频深度伪造检测的计算成本问题，具有域意识适应能力和扩展灵活性，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: While self-supervised learning (SSL)-based models have boosted audio deepfake
detection accuracy, fully finetuning them is computationally expensive. To
address this, we propose a parameter-efficient framework that combines Low-Rank
Adaptation with a Mixture-of-Experts router, called Mixture of LoRA Experts
(MoLEx). It preserves pre-trained knowledge of SSL models while efficiently
finetuning only selected experts, reducing training costs while maintaining
robust performance. The observed utility of experts during inference shows the
router reactivates the same experts for similar attacks but switches to other
experts for novel spoofs, confirming MoLEx's domain-aware adaptability. MoLEx
additionally offers flexibility for domain adaptation by allowing extra experts
to be trained without modifying the entire model. We mainly evaluate our
approach on the ASVSpoof 5 dataset and achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
equal error rate (EER) of 5.56% on the evaluation set without augmentation.

*Xiaoxue Luo,Jinwei Huang,Runyan Yang,Yingying Gao,Junlan Feng,Chao Deng,Shilei Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DeCodec是一个创新的神经编解码器，通过学习将音频表示解耦到正交子空间中，分别处理语音和背景声音，并在语音内部进一步分解为语义和副语言成分，实现可控的特征选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界音频通常包含混合的语音和背景声音，而下游任务需要选择性访问这些组件。现有的通用音频编解码器学习纠缠表示，而特定编解码器虽然提供解耦表示但仅限于语音处理。

Method: 基于编解码器框架，DeCodec引入两个关键创新：子空间正交投影模块将输入分解为两个解耦的正交子空间，以及表示交换训练程序确保这两个子空间分别对应语音和背景声音。使用并行RVQ独立量化语音和背景声音组件，并通过语义引导实现语音内部的语义和副语言分解。

Result: 实验结果显示DeCodec在保持先进信号重建的同时，实现了新功能：通过表示重组在嘈杂语音上实现卓越的语音增强和有效的一次性语音转换，通过干净的语义特征提高ASR鲁棒性，以及在TTS中实现可控的背景声音保留/抑制。

Conclusion: DeCodec作为一个通用的解耦表示学习器，通过层次化解耦实现了灵活的特征选择，使其成为多个音频应用的通用前端，为音频处理提供了新的可控性和灵活性。

Abstract: Universal audio codecs learn entangled representations across audio types,
whereas some specific codecs offer decoupled representations but are limited to
speech. Real-world audio, however, often contains mixed speech and background
sounds, and downstream tasks require selective access to these components.
Therefore, we rethink the audio codec as a universal disentangled
representation learner to enable controllable feature selection across
different audio tasks. To this end, we introduce DeCodec, a novel neural codec
that learns to decouple audio representations into orthogonal subspaces
dedicated to speech and background sound, and within speech, representations
are further decomposed into semantic and paralinguistic components. This
hierarchical disentanglement allows flexible feature selection, making DeCodec
a universal front-end for multiple audio applications. Technically, built upon
a codec framework, DeCodec incorporates two key innovations: a subspace
orthogonal projection module that factorizes the input into two decoupled
orthogonal subspaces, and a representation swap training procedure that ensures
these two subspaces are correlate to the speech and background sound,
respectively. These allows parallel RVQs to quantize speech and background
sound components independently. Furthermore, we employ semantic guidance to the
speech RVQ to achieve semantic and paralinguistic decomposition. Experimental
results show that DeCodec maintains advanced signal reconstruction while
enabling new capabilities: superior speech enhancement and effective one-shot
voice conversion on noisy speech via representation recombination, improved ASR
robustness through clean semantic features, and controllable background sound
preservation/suppression in TTS. Demo Page: https://luo404.github.io/DeCodecV2/

TL;DR: 该文章提出了一种新的音频深度伪造检测评估框架，解决传统评估方法中合成器样本不均衡和真实语音类型缺乏多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频深度伪造检测评估存在两个主要问题：1）使用合并多个合成器的数据集时，EER指标会不成比优先考虑样本量更多的合成器；2）大多数数据集真实语音类型单一，无法模拟真实场景。

Method: 提出真实跨测试评估框架，包含多样化的真实语音数据集并聚合多个EER进行更均衡的评估。对150多个合成器在9种不同真实语音类型上进行基准测试，并开源了新的数据集。

Result: 该方法提高了模型评估的稳健性和可解释性，较传统评估方法更能模拟真实世界条件。

Conclusion: 真实跨测试框架为音频深度伪造检测领域提供了更加全面和可靠的评估方法，有助于推动该领域的研究进步。

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) models are commonly evaluated using datasets
that combine multiple synthesizers, with performance reported as a single Equal
Error Rate (EER). However, this approach disproportionately weights
synthesizers with more samples, underrepresenting others and reducing the
overall reliability of EER. Additionally, most ADD datasets lack diversity in
bona fide speech, often featuring a single environment and speech style (e.g.,
clean read speech), limiting their ability to simulate real-world conditions.
To address these challenges, we propose bona fide cross-testing, a novel
evaluation framework that incorporates diverse bona fide datasets and
aggregates EERs for more balanced assessments. Our approach improves robustness
and interpretability compared to traditional evaluation methods. We benchmark
over 150 synthesizers across nine bona fide speech types and release a new
dataset to facilitate further research at

Conclusion: 提出的知识蒸馏框架结合设备感知特征对齐和设备特定微调，有效解决了低复杂度设备鲁棒声学场景分类问题，在DCASE 2025挑战赛中表现突出。

Abstract: In this technical report, we describe our submission for Task 1,
Low-Complexity Device-Robust Acoustic Scene Classification, of the DCASE 2025
Challenge. Our work tackles the dual challenges of strict complexity
constraints and robust generalization to both seen and unseen devices, while
also leveraging the new rule allowing the use of device labels at test time.
Our proposed system is based on a knowledge distillation framework where an
efficient CP-MobileNet student learns from a compact, specialized two-teacher
ensemble. This ensemble combines a baseline PaSST teacher, trained with
standard cross-entropy, and a 'generalization expert' teacher. This expert is
trained using our novel Device-Aware Feature Alignment (DAFA) loss, adapted
from prior work, which explicitly structures the feature space for device
robustness. To capitalize on the availability of test-time device labels, the
distilled student model then undergoes a final device-specific fine-tuning
stage. Our proposed system achieves a final accuracy of 57.93\% on the
development set, demonstrating a significant improvement over the official
baseline, particularly on unseen devices.

Motivation: 传统Transformer在钢琴转录中因自注意力机制的二次复杂度而无法处理完整音乐片段，需要滑动窗口处理，限制了模型性能

Method: 使用滑动窗口自注意力机制（编码器和解码器）、混合全局-局部交叉注意力机制（根据MIDI token类型关注不同跨度）、分层池化策略

Result: 在MAESTRO数据集上实现计算成本和内存使用的显著降低，推理速度加快，同时保持与全注意力基线相当的转录性能

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力机制可用于构建高效高性能的钢琴转录系统，允许在相同硬件上使用更长的音频上下文进行训练

Abstract: This paper investigates automatic piano transcription based on
computationally-efficient yet high-performant variants of the Transformer that
can capture longer-term dependency over the whole musical piece. Recently,
transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated excellent
performance in piano transcription. These models, however, fail to deal with
the whole piece at once due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention
mechanism, and music signals are thus typically processed in a sliding-window
manner in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient
architecture with sparse attention mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce
sliding-window self-attention mechanisms for both the encoder and decoder, and
a hybrid global-local cross-attention mechanism that attends to various spans
according to the MIDI token types. We also use a hierarchical pooling strategy
between the encoder and decoder to further reduce computational load. Our
experiments on the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed model achieved a
significant reduction in computational cost and memory usage, accelerating
inference speed, while maintaining transcription performance comparable to the
full-attention baseline. This allows for training with longer audio contexts on
the same hardware, demonstrating the viability of sparse attention for building
efficient and high-performance piano transcription systems. The code is

Motivation: 现有神经音频编解码器大多依赖残差向量量化(RVQ)，而有限标量量化(FSQ)作为新兴替代方案能简化训练并原生支持单码本，且具有内在冗余特性

Method: 提出基于FSQ的NeuCodec编解码器，通过编码器蒸馏实验证明不同编码器可产生差异巨大但重建质量相当的编码序列，并比较FSQ和RVQ在模拟噪声信道传输中的比特级扰动鲁棒性

Result: FSQ编码具有内置冗余特性，在噪声信道传输中表现出远优于RVQ的比特级扰动鲁棒性，不同编码器可学习到差异显著但效果相当的编码方式

Conclusion: FSQ为基础的神经音频编解码器在抗噪性能方面具有显著优势，为音频处理任务提供了更鲁棒的离散特征表示方案

Abstract: Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) have become increasingly adopted in speech
processing tasks due to their excellent rate-distortion performance and
compatibility with Large Language Models (LLMs) as discrete feature
representations for audio generation. While most existing codecs rely on
Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has
recently emerged as a compelling alternative that simplifies training and
natively supports single codebooks. We introduce NeuCodec, an FSQ-based NAC,
and show that FSQ encodes baked-in redundancy which produces an encoding which
is robust when transmitted through noisy channels. First, through an encoder
distillation experiment, we show that two different encoders can learn to
encode identical audio into vastly different code sequences whilst maintaining
comparable reconstruction quality with the same quantizer and decoder. Second,
we demonstrate that FSQ has vastly superior bit-level perturbation robustness
by comparing the performance of RVQ and FSQ codecs when simulating the
transmission of code sequences through a noisy channel.

Conclusion: DiFlow-TTS证明了纯离散流匹配在语音合成中的有效性，为高效高质量的零样本TTS提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that
mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample,
requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic
attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from
slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have
been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to
explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential
of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing
flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous
space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the
advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we
introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model
to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS
explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified
architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual
content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference
speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In
addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with
distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn
aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS
achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,
prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a
compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to
25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.

Abstract: In human-computer interaction applications like hand gesture recognition,
supervised learning models are often trained on a large population of users to
achieve high task accuracy. However, due to individual variability in sensor
signals and user behavior, static models may not provide optimal performance
for all users. Personalizing pretrained models via calibration--collecting
labeled data from each user--can improve performance but introduces user
friction and struggles with limited data. To overcome these issues, we propose
a calibrationless longitudinal personalization method: a contextual multi-arm
bandit (MAB) algorithm combined with a pretrained neural network for gesture
recognition. This reinforcement-learning-style approach enables personalization
using binary reward signals, either user-provided or inferred by the system.
  We validated this method in a user study. Participants wore a surface
electromyography (sEMG) device and played multiple rounds of a 2-D navigation
game using six hand gestures. In the session, they completed a baseline round
and then a round with our algorithm; in the second session, they played another
round with our algorithm. Our approach led to a significant reduction in users'
average false negative rate by 0.113 from the initial to the final round, with
further decreases between sessions. Average precision also trended upward (by
0.139) from the start to end of a round, continuing in the next session.

Method: 构建YAIR基准数据集，包含12,449个标注对话片段，涵盖78种细粒度风险类型；开发YouthSafe实时风险检测模型，针对青少年GenAI场景进行优化

Result: 现有审核模型在检测青少年中心化风险方面表现严重不足，经常遗漏上下文微妙但发展有害的交互；YouthSafe模型在风险检测和分类多个指标上显著优于先前系统

Conclusion: YAIR基准和YouthSafe模型为年轻用户提供了更安全、更适合发展的AI交互方案，是解决青少年LLM安全风险的重要进展

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by teenagers and young
adults in everyday life, ranging from emotional support and creative expression
to educational assistance. However, their unique vulnerabilities and risk
profiles remain under-examined in current safety benchmarks and moderation
systems, leaving this population disproportionately exposed to harm. In this
work, we present Youth AI Risk (YAIR), the first benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate and improve the safety of youth LLM interactions. YAIR consists of
12,449 annotated conversation snippets spanning 78 fine grained risk types,
grounded in a taxonomy of youth specific harms such as grooming, boundary
violation, identity confusion, and emotional overreliance. We systematically
evaluate widely adopted moderation models on YAIR and find that existing
approaches substantially underperform in detecting youth centered risks, often
missing contextually subtle yet developmentally harmful interactions. To
address these gaps, we introduce YouthSafe, a real-time risk detection model
optimized for youth GenAI contexts. YouthSafe significantly outperforms prior
systems across multiple metrics on risk detection and classification, offering
a concrete step toward safer and more developmentally appropriate AI
interactions for young users.

Conclusion: 当前SMTs的帮助资源存在显著缺陷，包括文档内容质量、导航困难和支持性功能不足，影响了开发者有效安全使用秘密管理工具的能力

Abstract: Software developers face risks of leaking their software secrets, such as API
keys or passwords, which can result in significant harm. Secret management
tools (SMTs), such as HashiCorp Vault Secrets or Infisical, are highly
recommended by industry, academia, and security guidelines to manage secrets
securely. SMTs are designed to help developers secure their secrets in a
central location, yet secrets leaks are still commonplace, and developers
report difficulty in learning how to setup and use SMTs. While SMTs typically
come with publicly available help resources (e.g., tool documentation and
interfaces), it is unclear if these actually help developers learn to
effectively use SMTs. Without usable help resources that onboards developers,
quick adoption and effective use of SMTs may be unrealistic. In a qualitative
two-step study, we observed 21 new users in person while they used SMTs to
perform two secret management tasks: secret storage and access, then secret
injection. We interviewed participants after each task to identify their
challenges and experiences using SMTs, with the assistance of help resources.
While our study sample is narrow, it serves as a reasonable proxy for new
developers who are likely to adopt SMTs early in their careers. We found that
even in a laboratory setting where new users found tool functionality,
interface flexibility helpful, they still experienced increased difficulty to
effectively use SMTs to securely remediate a hard-coded secret when they felt
tool documentation was insufficient and it motivated participants to deviate
from official tool documentation to access secondary sources or attempt
workaround methods. Specific challenges reported by participants were tool
documentation content quality, navigation difficulties with both tool
documentation and web interfaces for finding helpful content, and supportive
tool features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究伊朗网络审查环境下用户如何通过技术和社交策略翻墙，尤其关注数字识别能力强的游戏社群

Method: 混合方法研究：对660名伊朗用户调查，结合网络延迟和VPN性能测量，分析技术和社交翻墙策略

Result: 年轻用户翻墙信心更高，但同伴网络是弹性的最强预测因素；游戏社群通过Discord和Telegram分享技术，降低使用门槛

Conclusion: 基础设施条件与社会学习相交叉，为数字权利和信息控制工作者提供设计与政策启示

Abstract: Internet censorship in the Islamic Republic of Iran restricts access to
global platforms and services, forcing users to rely on circumvention
technologies such as VPNs, proxies, and tunneling tools. This report presents
findings from a mixed-methods study of 660 Iranian internet users, with a focus
on gamers as a digitally literate and socially networked community. Survey data
are combined with network measurements of latency and VPN performance to
identify both technical and social strategies of circumvention. Results show
that while younger users report higher confidence with circumvention, peer
networks, rather than formal training, are the strongest predictors of
resilience. Gaming communities, particularly those active on platforms such as
Discord and Telegram, serve as hubs for sharing tactics and lowering barriers
to adoption. These findings extend existing work on usable security and
censorship circumvention by highlighting the intersection of infrastructural
conditions and social learning. The study concludes with design and policy
implications for developers, researchers, and funders working on digital rights
and information controls.

Motivation: 探索当代社交媒体治理的失败原因和改革可能性，通过内容审查专业人员的实践经验来识别结构性问题。

Method: 进行参与式设计工坊，调研33名来自科技行业和民间社会的实践者，分析企业奖励机制与公共利益的对齐问题。

Result: 发现科技公司因制度性问题无法实现成功内容审查，包括刺激性劳动实践、对用户安全的长期投资不足、全球规模压力等。技术创新和高速增长导致平台优先考虑创新扩张而非公众信任和安全。

Conclusion: 通过重新考察计算机兼护工作的历史，推动平台治理工作者之间的团结，以激发系统性变革，应对当前社交媒体治理的挑战。

Abstract: This study examines the failures and possibilities of contemporary social
media governance through the lived experiences of various content moderation
professionals. Drawing on participatory design workshops with 33 practitioners
in both the technology industry and broader civil society, this research
identifies significant structural misalignments between corporate incentives
and public interests. While experts agree that successful content moderation is
principled, consistent, contextual, proactive, transparent, and accountable,
current technology companies fail to achieve these goals, due in part to
exploitative labor practices, chronic underinvestment in user safety, and
pressures of global scale. I argue that successful governance is undermined by
the pursuit of technological novelty and rapid growth, resulting in platforms
that necessarily prioritize innovation and expansion over public trust and
safety. To counter this dynamic, I revisit the computational history of care
work, to motivate present-day solidarity amongst platform governance workers
and inspire systemic change.

Motivation: 研究直播平台与传统点播平台在用户行为上的差异，特别是实时交互特性对用户关系的影响。

Method: 采用探索/利用（E/E）概念框架，分析了一个直播平台两年的大规模数据集。

Result: 用户在直播平台上也呈现E/E行为，但探索期更长；生物钟等外部因素影响E/E动态和用户忠诚度。

Conclusion: 强调在在线平台设计中平衡E/E的重要性，特别是对直播平台，为平台开发者和内容创作者提供了促进及时参与和留存的设计策略建议。

Abstract: Live streaming platforms offer a distinctive way for users and content
creators to interact with each other through real-time communication. While
research on user behavior in online platforms has explored how users discover
their favorite content from creators and engage with them, the role of
real-time features remains unclear. There are open questions as to what
commonalities and differences exist in users' relationships with live streaming
platforms compared to traditional on-demand style platforms. To understand
this, we employ the concept of Exploration/Exploitation (E/E) and analyze a
large-scale dataset from a live streaming platform over two years. Our results
indicate that even on live streaming platforms, users exhibit E/E behavior but
experience a longer exploration period. We also identify external factors, such
as circadian rhythms, that influence E/E dynamics and user loyalty. The
presented study emphasizes the importance of balancing E/E in online platform
design, especially for live streaming platforms, providing implications that
suggest design strategies for platform developers and content creators to
facilitate timely engagement and retention.

TL;DR: Sensible Agent是一个用于增强现实(AR)智能体的无干扰交互框架，通过多模态上下文感知动态调整辅助内容和交互方式，相比语音提示基线显著降低了交互负担


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AR智能体交互通常依赖显式语音提示，这种方式具有破坏性和社交尴尬性，需要更自然的无干扰交互方式

Method: 利用专家研讨会和数据标注研究设计框架，通过第一视角摄像头、多模态传感和大规模多模态模型(LMMs)推断上下文，提供最小干扰的交互模式

Result: 在XR头显上的用户研究表明，相比语音提示基线，Sensible Agent显著降低了感知交互努力，同时保持了高可用性并获得更高偏好

Conclusion: 该框架通过上下文感知和自适应交互方式，为AR智能体提供了更自然、无干扰的用户体验

Abstract: Proactive AR agents promise context-aware assistance, but their interactions
often rely on explicit voice prompts or responses, which can be disruptive or
socially awkward. We introduce Sensible Agent, a framework designed for
unobtrusive interaction with these proactive agents. Sensible Agent dynamically
adapts both "what" assistance to offer and, crucially, "how" to deliver it,
based on real-time multimodal context sensing. Informed by an expert workshop
(n=12) and a data annotation study (n=40), the framework leverages egocentric
cameras, multimodal sensing, and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to infer
context and suggest appropriate actions delivered via minimally intrusive
interaction modes. We demonstrate our prototype on an XR headset through a user
study (n=10) in both AR and VR scenarios. Results indicate that Sensible Agent
significantly reduces perceived interaction effort compared to voice-prompted
baseline, while maintaining high usability and achieving higher preference.

Conclusion: 该框架显示了人类适应性与自治效率之间的权衡，证明了将共享自治基于合作游戏论的实践价值。

Abstract: Shared autonomy requires principled mechanisms for allocating and
transferring control between a human and an autonomous agent. Existing
approaches often rely on blending control inputs between human and autonomous
agent or switching rules, which lack theoretical guarantees. This paper
develops a game-theoretic framework for modeling cooperative takeover in shared
autonomy. We formulate the switching interaction as a dynamic game in which
authority is embedded directly into the system dynamics, resulting in Nash
equilibrium(NE)-based strategies rather than ad hoc switching rules. We
establish the existence and characterization of NE in the space of pure
takeover strategies under stochastic human intent. For the class of
linear-quadratic systems, we derive closed-form recursions for takeover
strategies and saddle-point value functions, providing analytical insight and
efficient computation of cooperative takeover policies. We further introduce a
bimatrix potential game reformulation to address scenarios where human and
autonomy utilities are not perfectly aligned, yielding a unifying potential
function that preserves tractability while capturing intent deviations. The
framework is applied to a vehicle trajectory tracking problem, demonstrating
how equilibrium takeover strategies adapt across straight and curved path
segments. The results highlight the trade-off between human adaptability and
autonomous efficiency and illustrate the practical benefits of grounding shared
autonomy in cooperative game theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着价格更便宜的头显设备普及，增强现实技术将更广泛应用。眼动跟踪等新兴交互方式可能会收集大量生物识别数据，这些数据可能被用来推断健康状态、性偏好等敏感属性，引发严重隐私问题

Method: 在美国(n1=48, n2=525)和德国(n3=48, n4=525)进行四次群众源调查研究，分析用户属性、AR设备类型、使用场景、数据处理方式和国家因素对隐私担忧的影响

Result: 参与者在了解数据推断能力后显示出高度隐私担忧；虽然智能手机使用更普遍，但设备类型对隐私担忧没有显著差异；用户对自己盈利的场景更舒适，而当其他人能获取其数据时更不舒适；美国参与者比德国参与者隐私担忧程度更低

Conclusion: 研究结果显示AR眼动跟踪数据存在重大隐私风险，用户在了解数据潜在用途后会更加关注隐私。研究为实践者和政策制定者提供了隐私保护建议，以应对AR技术普及带来的隐私挑战

Abstract: Augmented reality technology will likely be prevalent with more affordable
head-mounted displays. Integrating novel interaction modalities such as eye
trackers into head-mounted displays could lead to collecting vast amounts of
biometric data, which may allow inference of sensitive user attributes like
health status or sexual preference, posing privacy issues. While previous works
broadly examined privacy concerns about augmented reality, ours is the first to
extensively explore privacy concerns on behavioral data, particularly eye
tracking in augmented reality. We crowdsourced four survey studies in the
United States (n1 = 48, n2 = 525) and Germany (n3 = 48, n4 = 525) to understand
the impact of user attributes, augmented reality devices, use cases, data
practices, and country on privacy concerns. Our findings indicate that
participants are generally concerned about privacy when they know what
inferences can be made based on the collected data. Despite the more prominent
use of smartphones in daily life than augmented reality glasses, we found no
indications of differing privacy concerns depending on the device type. In
addition, our participants are more comfortable when a particular use case
benefits them and less comfortable when other humans can consume their data.
Furthermore, participants in the United States are less concerned about their
privacy than those in Germany. Based on our findings, we provide several
recommendations to practitioners and policymakers for privacy-aware augmented
reality.

Motivation: 探讨AI助手在职场中主动提供帮助时如何影响用户采纳，揭示心理机制

Method: 两个基于情景的实验（研究1：761人；研究2：571人，预注册），比较预期性和反应性帮助，区分建议帮助和自动提供帮助

Result: AI帮助比人类帮助更具威胁性，预期性帮助增加感知威胁并降低采纳结果

Conclusion: 自我威胁是解释主动AI功能可能适得其反的机制，为AI主动性设计提供启示

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants are increasingly embedded in
workplace tools, raising the question of how initiative-taking shapes adoption.
Prior work highlights trust and expectation mismatches as barriers, but the
underlying psychological mechanisms remain unclear. Drawing on self-affirmation
and social exchange theories, we theorize that unsolicited help elicits
self-threat, reducing willingness to accept assistance, likelihood of future
use, and performance expectancy. We report two vignette-based experiments
(Study~1: $N=761$; Study~2: $N=571$, preregistered). Study~1 compared
anticipatory and reactive help provided by an AI vs. a human, while Study~2
distinguished between \emph{offering} (suggesting help) and \emph{providing}
(acting automatically). In Study 1, AI help was more threatening than human
help. Across both studies, anticipatory help increased perceived threat and
reduced adoption outcomes. Our findings identify self-threat as a mechanism
explaining why proactive AI features may backfire and suggest design
implications for AI initiative.

Abstract: Smart assistive technologies such as sensor-based footwear and walking aids
offer promising opportunities to support rehabilitation through real-time
feedback and patient-centered monitoring. However, most orthotic devices remain
passive and lack integrated sensing or feedback functionalities, while existing
research often focuses on isolated prototypes rather than cohesive, interactive
systems. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a novel
modular sensor system that combines a smart foot orthosis with an instrumented
forearm crutch. The system integrates plantar pressure and motion sensing,
vibrotactile feedback, and wireless communication via a smartphone application.
We conducted an experimental user study with eight participants to validate the
feasibility of the smart foot orthosis for mobile gait detection, explore the
potential of haptic feedback for user interaction, and assess the usability of
the accompanying mobile health application. Our work contributes to the field
of smart assistive technology in rehabilitation and prevention by demonstrating
a functional and comprehensive system. We further discuss system limitations,
outline potential application scenarios, and provide recommendations for future
development and clinical integration.

Conclusion: RTK与OST-HMD混合系统在外部追踪任务中具有强大潜力，需要进一步研究以提高系统性能

Abstract: This paper presents an outdoor tracking system using Real-Time Kinematic
(RTK) positioning and Optical See-Through Head Mounted Display(s) (OST-HMD(s))
in urban areas where the accurate tracking of objects is critical and where
displaying occluded information is important for safety reasons. The approach
presented here replaces 2D screens/tablets and offers distinct advantages,
particularly in scenarios demanding hands-free operation. The integration of
RTK, which provides centimeter-level accuracy of tracked objects, with OST-HMD
represents a promising solution for outdoor applications. This paper provides
valuable insights into leveraging the combined potential of RTK and OST-HMD for
outdoor tracking tasks from the perspectives of systems integration,
performance optimization, and usability. The main contributions of this paper
are: \textbf{1)} a system for seamlessly merging RTK systems with OST-HMD to
enable relatively precise and intuitive outdoor tracking, \textbf{2)} an
approach to determine a global location to achieve the position relative to the
world, \textbf{3)} an approach referred to as 'semi-dynamic' for system
assessment. Moreover, we offer insights into several relevant future research
topics aimed at improving the OST-HMD and RTK hybrid system for outdoor
tracking.

Motivation: 医疗领域用户需要处理高维、编码和异构数据集，传统可视化系统的动态查询界面需要用户记忆字段名和系统代码，造成使用障碍

Method: 使用LLM生成的查询将自然语言意图转换为可编辑和可执行的查询，减少视觉杂乱，同时按需重新引入动态查询以支持交互探索

Conclusion: LLM作为交互层能支持医学用户进行流畅探索，虽然不暴露所有过滤标准，但解决了记忆属性名称和代码值的挑战

Abstract: We propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interaction layer
for medical visualization systems. In domains like healthcare, where users must
navigate high-dimensional, coded, and heterogeneous datasets, LLM-generated
queries enable expert medical users to express complex analytical intents in
natural language. These intents are then translated into editable and
executable queries, replacing the dynamic query interfaces used by traditional
visualization systems built around sliders, check boxes, and drop-downs. This
interaction model reduces visual clutter and eliminates the need for users to
memorize field names or system codes, supporting fluid exploration, with the
drawback of not exposing all the filtering criteria. We also reintroduce
dynamic queries on demand to better support interactive exploration. We posit
that medical users are trained to know the possible filtering options but
challenged to remember the details of the attribute names and code values. We
demonstrate this paradigm in ParcoursVis, our scalable EventFlow-inspired
patient care pathway visualization system powered by the French National Health
Data System, one of the largest health data repositories in the world.

Conclusion: 该框架可以指导可视化的评估和重新设计，为可视化设计提供理论基础和实践指南。

Abstract: Classically, affordance research investigates how the shape of objects
communicates actions to potential users. Cognitive affordances, a subset of
this research, characterize how the design of objects influences cognitive
actions, such as information processing. Within visualization, cognitive
affordances inform how graphs' design decisions communicate information to
their readers. Although several related concepts exist in visualization, a
formal translation of affordance theory to visualization is still lacking. In
this paper, we review and translate affordance theory to visualization by
formalizing how cognitive affordances operate within a visualization context.
We also review common methods and terms, and compare related constructs to
cognitive affordances in visualization. Based on a synthesis of research from
psychology, human computer interaction, and visualization, we propose a
framework of cognitive affordances in visualization that enumerates design
decisions and reader characteristics that influence a visualization's hierarchy
of communicated information. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework can
guide the evaluation and redesign of visualizations.

Result: AI标签削弱了信息对发送者性格的诊断性：AI辅助的道歉让发送者显得不那么温暖，AI辅助的责备让发送者显得不那么冷漠

Conclusion: AI辅助标签降低了信息的信号诊断性，这解释了先前AI中介沟通研究中观察到的现象

Abstract: When someone sends us a thoughtful message, we naturally form judgments about
their character. But what happens when that message carries a label indicating
it was written with the help of AI? This paper investigates how the appearance
of AI assistance affects our perceptions of message senders. Adding nuance to
previous research, through two studies (N=399) featuring vignette scenarios, we
find that AI-assistance labels don't necessarily make people view senders
negatively. Rather, they dampen the strength of character signals in
communication. We show that when someone sends a warmth-signalling message
(like thanking or apologizing) without AI help, people more strongly categorize
the sender as warm. At the same time, when someone sends a coldness-signalling
message (like bragging or blaming) without assistance, people more confidently
categorize them as cold. Interestingly, AI labels weaken both these
associations: An AI-assisted apology makes the sender appear less warm than if
they had written it themselves, and an AI-assisted blame makes the sender
appear less cold than if they had composed it independently. This supports our
signal diagnosticity explanation: messages labeled as AI-assisted are viewed as
less diagnostic than messages which seem unassisted. We discuss how our
findings shed light on the causal origins of previously reported observations
in AI-Mediated Communication.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于物理向导神经网络(PINN)的连续时间多段代理强化学习框架(CT-MARL)，通过值梯度迭代(VGI)模块提高价值函数近似精度，解决高维度多段代系统中的曲线维数问题和攻略训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在复杂动力学系统中面临高频率或不规则时间间隔交互的挑战。连续时间RL(CTRL)作为有前景的替代方案，但在多段代领域存在两大挑战：汉孟-雅可比-贝尔曼(HJB)方程的曲线维数问题，以及多段代环境中中央化价值函数近似困难导致攻略训练不稳定。

Method: 使用物理向导神经网络(PINNs)来近似HJB基于价值函数。通过值梯度迭代(VGI)模块在轨迹上迭代精炼值梯度，将价值学习与值梯度学习对齐，确保价值与其微分结构一致。

Result: 在连续时间版本的多段代粒子环境(MPE)和多段代MuJoCo标准测试中，该方法一贯表现超过现有连续时间RL基线，并能够扩展到复杂多段代动力学系统。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的CT-MARL框架通过PINN和VGI技术，有效解决了高维度多段代系统中HJB方程的曲线维数问题和价值函数近似困难，为复杂动力学系统提供了可扩展的连续时间多段代强化学习方案。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个改进的矩阵乘性权重更新算法，在矩阵版本的学习专家建议问题上实现了实例最优的遗憾界，计算复杂度与原始MMWU相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题上只能达到最小最大最优遗憾界，但无法实现实例最优性能。本文旨在开发一个既能保持计算效率又能获得更好遗憾界的改进算法。

Method: 开发了一个基于势能的通用框架，MMWU是其特例。通过新的单边Jensen迹不等式和拉普拉斯变换技术，应用了基于虚误差函数的最优势能函数。

Result: 新算法实现了O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))的实例最优遗憾界，计算复杂度与MMWU相同。在量子态学习、去极化噪声、随机量子态和Gibbs态学习等应用中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 成功开发了一个计算效率高且遗憾界更优的矩阵LEA算法，该改进是"免费"的（不增加计算成本），并在量子学习理论中展示了显著的应用优势。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

*Sreejeet Maity,Aritra Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对对抗性奖励腐败的鲁棒Q学习算法，在异步采样模型下证明了有限时间收敛性，收敛速率与非对抗情况相当，仅增加与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法在奖励信号受到对抗性腐败（如极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击）时性能会严重下降，需要开发能够有效处理此类腐败的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出了一种新的可证明鲁棒的Q学习变体算法，该算法即使在部分观测奖励被对手任意扰动时也能有效运行。还提出了一个无需先验了解真实奖励分布统计信息的算法变体。

Result: 在异步采样模型下，尽管存在对抗性腐败，算法的有限时间收敛速率与非对抗情况下的现有结果匹配，仅增加与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项。信息论下界表明该附加项是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 这项工作为异步Q学习提供了首个有限时间鲁棒性保证，填补了鲁棒强化学习领域的重要空白，所开发的技术工具（如改进的Azuma-Hoeffding不等式）可能具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

TL;DR: 提出基于Wasserstein距离的分布鲁棒优化框架，解决多源异构数据中群体分布不确定性下的最差群体性能优化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设群体分布可准确估计，但在噪声、非平稳和动态环境中这一假设常被违反，导致模型在非典型或欠代表群体上性能下降

Method: 使用Wasserstein距离的分布鲁棒优化(DRO)方法，同时考虑群体内分布不确定性并优化最差群体性能，开发了梯度下降-上升算法求解

Result: 在真实世界数据上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理群体分布不确定性，提升模型在最差群体上的鲁棒性能

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文通过将LRP型归因方法表示为修改梯度矩阵的乘积，分析了其数值特性，推导了奇异值上界和归因图值的分量界，并获得了控制经验均值收敛到期望的乘法常数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析LRP型归因方法的数值特性，特别是研究归因值分布和收敛性质，为多数据增强场景和Smoothgrad型方法提供理论依据。

Method: 将LRP归因方法表示为修改梯度矩阵的乘积，推导奇异值上界和分量界，应用分量界获得控制收敛的乘法常数。

Result: 发现LRP-beta的常数与权重范数无关，这与基于梯度的方法和LRP-epsilon有显著区别。

Conclusion: 该分析对多非几何数据增强场景和Smoothgrad型归因方法有重要影响，揭示了LRP-beta方法的独特数值特性。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: 碳费用意识的客户端选择咈训练调度是降低联邦学习碳费用的有效方法，通过智能调度可以在碳限制下保持高模型性能

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了聚合物薄膜旋涂的多目标优化问题，通过结合机器学习、可视化和可解释AI技术，为材料设计提供了有效的优化和解释工具。

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有XAI框架的两个主要限制：特征子集枚举的指数级计算成本和将效应总结为单一标量值的表达能力不足问题。

Method: 基于再生核希尔伯特空间的正交函数分解方法，通过递归核中心化程序的分析投影方案计算功能组件f_S(x_S)，避免显式子集枚举。

Result: 在10个数据集上实现中位数约3倍的加速（范围0.6-9.7倍），保持高保真度（R² 0.81-0.999）和良好的排序一致性，支持局部和全局解释。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过提供结构化功能视角补充标量归因方法，支持新颖的诊断功能如'组件手术'来量化特定交互作用的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Rashomon Ensemble方法，通过策略性地从多个性能相近的模型中选取基于性能和解释多样性的模型组合，提高泛化能力，在真实数据集上实现高达0.20+ AUROC提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中选择泛化能力好的模型具有挑战性，Rashomon效应表明同一问题存在多个性能相近的模型，特别是在制造过程和医疗诊断等真实场景中，数据多样性导致多种高性能解决方案

Method: 提出Rashomon Ensemble方法，基于模型性能和解释进行分组，构建既保持预测准确性又最大化多样性的集成模型，确保每个模型覆盖解空间的不同区域

Result: 在开放和专有的真实数据集上验证，当Rashomon比例较大时，AUROC提升高达0.20+，并在多个实际业务应用中展示了稳健性、实用性和有效性

Conclusion: Rashomon Ensemble方法通过策略性选择多样化的高性能模型，显著提高了模型在分布偏移和未见数据变化情况下的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该研究为深度线性网络的学习过程提供了几何热力学框架，群轨道对平衡流形的叶状结构分析是定义熵的关键技术贡献。

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

TL;DR: Sensitivity-LoRA是一种高效的LLM微调方法，通过基于权重矩阵的全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，解决了传统LoRA均匀秩分配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法采用均匀秩分配，而现有的秩分配技术计算效率低、复杂且不稳定，限制了实际应用。需要一种更高效的秩分配方法。

Method: 利用损失函数的二阶导数（Hessian矩阵）捕捉权重敏感度，基于全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，实现最优秩分配且计算开销最小。

Result: 实验结果表明，Sensitivity-LoRA在不同任务和基准测试中表现出强大的有效性、效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA提供了一种计算高效、稳定且有效的LLM微调方法，解决了传统LoRA的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习模型基于相关性学习，难以区分真正的因果关系和虚假关联，限制了模型的鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力。

Method: 整合多元格兰杰因果关系(MVGC)和PCMCI+进行因果特征选择，构建混合神经网络架构，使用1979-2021年北极海冰范围数据和相关海洋大气变量。

Result: 实验结果表明，引入因果输入特征在不同预测时间尺度上都能提高预测准确性和模型可解释性，同时减少不必要的特征并提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 该因果感知框架不仅适用于北极海冰预测，还可推广到其他动态高维领域，为因果驱动的预测建模提供了可扩展的理论基础和实践方法。

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习模型预测ISP对等互联伙伴选择，XGBoost模型在公开数据上达到98%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISP之间的对等互联过程复杂耗时，自动化选择对等伙伴能提高全球互联网生态系统的效率

Method: 利用PeeringDB、CAIDA等公开数据，评估树基模型、神经网络和Transformer三类机器学习模型的对等关系预测性能

Result: 树基模型（特别是XGBoost）在实验中表现最佳，准确率达98%，且对时间、空间变化和缺失数据具有强韧性

Conclusion: 该方法可帮助ISP完全自动化对等伙伴选择过程，实现更高效优化的互联网生态系统

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

TL;DR: 首个大规模西班牙语话音检测数据集HISPASpoof，包含真实语音和6种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音，解决西班牙语话音验真领域的缺口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前语音检测器主要集中在英语和中文，而西班牙语作为全球超过600万人使用的语言却缺乏相应的语音验真数据集和研究。

Method: 构建HISPASpoof数据集，包含公开语料库中6种口音的真实语音，以6种零样本TTS系统生成合成语音。评估5种代表性检测方法的性能。

Result: 基于英语训练的检测器在西班牙语上表现差，而使用HISPASpoof训练显著提升检测效果，同时在合成语音源谨分配任务上也取得良好表现。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为西班牙语话音验真领域提供了重要的基准数据集，有助于推动更可靠和包容性话音验真技术的发展。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPO/GRPO方法在序列级RL中存在固定裁剪范围对长短响应重新加权的系统性问题，导致有效目标失真

Method: 提出FSPO方法，使用高斯动机的解决方案：用KL校正漂移项和√L缩放的带对序列对数IS比率进行裁剪

Result: FSPO在不同长度区间内平滑了裁剪率，稳定了训练过程，并在多个评估数据集上优于所有基线方法

Conclusion: FSPO通过长度公平裁剪机制有效解决了序列级RL中的长度偏差问题，提供了理论保证和实证优势

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

Motivation: 解决当前天气预测模型评价指标存在的"统计相似性陷阱"问题，这种指标导致模型评价时奖励模糊预测而忽视了稀有但高影响的极端天气事件的检测能力。

Method: 提出DART（Dual Architecture for Regression Tasks）框架，采用双解码器结构，包括显式的背景/极端分解、物理动机过采样和任务特定损失函数，将粗糖大气预测转换为高分辨率卫星亮温场。

Result: 实验结果显示：(1)验证了统计相似性陷阱的存在；(2)发现"IVT矛盾"，移除总水气运输可以提升极端对流检测270%；(3)DART在相同CSI值下偏差从6.72降至2.52；(4)通过2023年8月吉大铺洪水灾害案例验证。

Conclusion: DART框架系统性解决了混合转换-分割-降维任务的挑战，能够在10分钟内训练完成，无缝集成到现有气象工作流程中，为极端天气预防提供了可靠的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

Motivation: 连续控制场景中的约束强化学习需要在奖励最大化和约束满足之间取得平衡，但现有策略优化方法在约束边界附近表现不稳定，导致训练性能不佳。

Method: 引入自适应激励机制，在接近约束边界前保持约束限制，并提出IP3O算法实施渐进增加的惩罚来稳定训练动态。

Result: 在基准环境上的实证评估显示，IP3O相比最先进的安全RL算法表现出更好的效能，并提供了理论最优性误差界限保证。

Conclusion: IP3O算法通过渐进惩罚机制有效解决了约束强化学习中的训练稳定性问题，在保持约束满足的同时实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models

used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构化状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题，传统方法难以处理不同规模和结构的问题，需要能够归纳泛化的策略函数。

Method: 将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，转换为二分图，通过神经消息传递映射到潜在状态。使用监督学习和强化学习训练策略，采用因子化表示处理不同规模问题。

Result: 在8个RDDL问题域的测试中，Vejde代理在未见实例上的平均得分接近实例特定的MLP代理，且没有显著性能损失，优于在线规划算法Prost。

Conclusion: Vejde框架能够有效生成可泛化的归纳策略，在处理结构化决策问题时表现出色，为复杂环境中的策略学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

Motivation: 解决现有QA模拟器中LLM-free方法性能不佳而LLM-based方法推理速度慢、资源消耗高的问题，需要在性能和效率之间找到平衡

Method: LDSim（LLM蒸馏模拟器），从大型语言模型中蒸馏领域知识和推理能力来辅助预测，提升模拟性能

Result: 在模拟任务和知识追踪任务上都取得了强劲的结果，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡

Conclusion: LDSim方法通过知识蒸馏有效提升了QA模拟器的性能，为教育推荐系统提供了高质量的训练数据生成方案

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出MMT-FD方法解决旋转机械故障诊断中标注数据稀缺和模型泛化能力不足的问题，通过多注意力元变换器实现少样本无监督故障诊断，仅需1%标注数据即可达到99%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业应用中获取大量标注故障数据困难且成本高，不同机械设备需要单独训练诊断模型，现有方法在样本有限和泛化能力方面存在不足

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架能有效提取无标注数据中的故障特征表示，具有高效的少样本学习能力和强大的跨设备泛化性能，适用于实际工业应用

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 长时任务中稀疏奖励难以分配信用，传统方法通过密集奖励信号引导学习，但LLM学习动态中存在策略梯度幅度与熵耦合的根本问题

Method: 提出熵调制策略梯度(EMPG)框架，基于步骤不确定性和最终任务结果重新校准学习信号，放大自信正确动作的更新，惩罚自信错误，衰减不确定步骤的更新

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和DeepSearch三个挑战性任务上的实验表明，EMPG实现了显著的性能提升，大幅优于强策略梯度基线

Conclusion: EMPG通过解耦策略梯度与熵的关系，有效解决了长时任务中的信用分配问题，为LLM智能体学习提供了更稳定高效的框架

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Conclusion: MoSE通过混合专家框架实现了灵活且表达力强的子图表示学习，在多种图任务中表现出色并具有理论保证和可解释性

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Motivation: HGR相关系数作为皮尔逊相关系数的非线性扩展，在算法公平性、科学分析和因果发现中有重要应用，但现有计算方法存在偏差-方差权衡问题，影响实际应用的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的多项式核方法为HGR相关系数计算提供了更可靠和实用的解决方案，特别适合现实世界应用场景。

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Motivation: 解决深度学习中模型和超参数选择需要大量专业知识和计算资源的问题，克服现有AutoML和LLM方法依赖试错、API昂贵、可解释性和泛化性有限的局限性。

Method: 利用历史实验结果和SHAP解释，结合元学习和LLM推理，采用LLM-as-judge评估来控制输出格式、准确性和完整性。

Result: 在8个医学影像数据集上测试，MetaLLMiX性能优于传统HPO方法，计算成本大幅降低，本地部署在5/8任务上达到最优结果，响应时间减少99.6-99.9%，训练速度提升2.4-15.7倍，准确率保持在最佳基线1-5%以内。

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX提供了一种高效、低成本、可解释的超参数优化解决方案，特别适合资源受限的应用场景，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot
hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,
and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with
SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8
tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times
on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型生成的自我反事实解释(SCEs)存在有效性-最小性权衡问题，要么修改过多不够简洁，要么修改过少无法改变预测结果，作为可解释性工具效果有限甚至可能误导

Motivation: 研究语言模型如何通过自我生成的反事实解释来向人类解释其决策过程，这对于人机协作至关重要

Method: 评估LLMs生成的反事实解释是否有效(达到预期结果)和最小化(只做必要修改)，在多个LLMs、数据集和评估设置中进行测试

Result: LLMs通常能生成有效的反事实解释但远非最小化；当要求生成最小化修改时，往往修改过小无法改变预测结果

Conclusion: SCEs作为可解释性工具效果有限甚至可能误导，在关键应用场景中部署LLMs时必须考虑不可靠自我解释对下游决策的影响

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

Motivation: 机器学习和地统计学在土壤属性预测中各有优势但方法不同，需要开发一个能结合两者优势的混合框架来提升数字土壤制图的性能

Method: 提出KpR方法，通过普通克里金法生成'空间滞后'特征来丰富机器学习模型的空间上下文，使用TabPFN模型在LimeSoDa的6个农田数据集上进行评估

Result: KpR与TabPFN结合相比其他空间技术和非空间机器学习算法，提供了更可靠的不确定性估计和更准确的预测，平均R2提高了约30%

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN是一个强大且通用的数字土壤制图建模框架，特别适用于样本量小的精准农业场景，能补偿近端土壤传感数据有限时的弱关系问题

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

Method: 使用Same-All Cross-validation (SAC)框架评估算法性能，提出fuser算法在保留子样本特异性信号的同时跨环境共享相关信息，生成环境特异性预测网络

Result: fuser在同类环境(Same)中与glmnet等现有算法性能相当，在跨环境(All)场景中显著降低了测试误差

Conclusion: fuser算法能够有效处理微生物群落的时空动态变化，为跨环境微生物网络推断提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and

Result: 在不同目标函数上表现出可证明的次线性收敛率，实验显示在保持隐私的同时显著提升准确率

Conclusion: D2P2-SGD通过动态隐私和随机投影技术，有效解决了隐私保护与模型性能的平衡问题

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然具有分布式学习优势，但在数据异构性下容易受到对抗攻击，现有防御机制在非IID场景下效果不佳

Method: 使用基于梯度接近性和差异性的联合双评分系统来评估客户端梯度，从双重角度检测攻击

Result: 在广泛数值实验中，ProDiGy在各种场景下优于现有防御方法，特别是在非IID数据分布时仍保持强大的防御能力和模型准确性

Conclusion: 双重视角方法有效，既能促进诚实客户端间的自然相似性，又能检测可疑一致性作为攻击指标

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Motivation: 传统数值积分方法计算成本高昂，难以高效探索参数空间。需要开发能够处理不同参数值、域大小和分辨率的计算高效模拟器，同时提供不确定性量化来研究罕见事件。

Method: 采用预训练-微调框架：先在单一参数域预训练，然后在多样化小数据集上微调。引入局部注意力机制处理变化的域大小和分辨率，支持从小域预训练泛化到大域。

Result: 在混沌Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程和随机强迫beta平面湍流上验证，模型能够捕捉插值参数值的现象，相比传统数值积分提供显著计算加速，概率变体提供不确定性量化。

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis

inputs. Inspired by the Reduced Basis Method and the recently introduced
Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,
and CNO, numerical results demonstrate that ReBaNO significantly outperforms
them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在动态环境中经常遭受概念漂移，虽然检测漂移已有研究，但解释模型决策逻辑如何变化仍是一个重大挑战

Method: 通过追踪群体反事实解释(GCEs)的聚类中心点和相关反事实行动向量在漂移前后的变化，构建三层分析框架(数据层、模型层、解释层)

Result: 该方法能够揭示模型决策边界和底层逻辑的结构性变化，区分不同根本原因(如空间数据漂移vs概念重新标记)

Conclusion: 提出的方法为概念漂移提供了更全面的诊断能力，使解释模型决策逻辑变化成为可能

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics,
demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant提出了一种可学习的蝴蝶变换方法，通过连续参数化的正交变换来消除激活值中的异常值，显著提升了2位量化的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要大量内存，2位量化因激活值中的异常值导致性能严重下降。现有的旋转方法使用固定的Hadamard变换，无法适应不同Transformer层的特定异常值模式。

Method: 用可学习的蝴蝶变换替代固定的Hadamard变换，通过连续Givens旋转角度参数化，保证正交性同时支持梯度优化。引入均匀性正则化促进量化友好的平滑分布。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B模型上，2位量化的困惑度从QuaRot的22.1降至15.4，仅需128个校准样本和单GPU几分钟的训练时间。

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant通过层自适应的可学习正交变换有效抑制异常值，在极低精度量化中实现了显著性能提升，计算复杂度低且训练成本可忽略。

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

Motivation: 当前许多元启发式算法声称基于等效函数评估次数具有优越性能，但往往隐藏了更密集迭代、预处理阶段或超参数调优带来的额外计算负担，需要更公平和实用的评估方法。

Method: 提出固定时间、重启公平的基准测试协议，每个算法在每个问题实例上分配相同的实际运行时间预算，允许无限制使用重启、早期终止标准和内部自适应机制。推荐使用基于时间的随时性能曲线、期望运行时间指标和性能剖面。

Conclusion: 采用实际运行时间作为主要预算约束的评估方法能够促进元启发式算法更可信和实际相关的性能评估，为此提供了标准化的报告清单来减轻未公开的计算开销。

Abstract: Numerous purportedly improved metaheuristics claim superior performance based
on equivalent function evaluations (FEs), yet often conceal additional
computational burdens in more intensive iterations, preprocessing stages, or
hyperparameter tuning. This paper posits that wall-clock time, rather than
solely FEs, should serve as the principal budgetary constraint for equitable
comparisons. We formalize a fixed-time, restart-fair benchmarking protocol
wherein each algorithm is allotted an identical wall-clock time budget per
problem instance, permitting unrestricted utilization of restarts, early
termination criteria, and internal adaptive mechanisms. We advocate for the
adoption of anytime performance curves, expected running time (ERT) metrics,
and performance profiles that employ time as the cost measure, all aimed at
predefined targets. Furthermore, we introduce a concise, reproducible checklist
to standardize reporting practices and mitigate undisclosed computational
overheads. This approach fosters more credible and practically relevant
evaluations of metaheuristic algorithms.

Conclusion: MRIME-CD算法通过多种改进策略成功解决了RIME算法的局限性，显著提高了优化性能，是一种有效的改进元启发式算法。

Abstract: Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient
solutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based
metaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid
loss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into
local optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address
the shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance
learning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three
strategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning
strategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population
diversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the
bootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the
tendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early
search stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the
hard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the
weighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search
ability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is
proposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the
stagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus
enhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed
MRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test
set, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the
Friedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The
results show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic
RIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence
speed and stability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始教育竞争优化算法(ECO)存在开发和探索不平衡的问题，容易陷入局部最优，在处理复杂优化问题时效果有限，需要改进算法性能。

Method: 引入三种不同的协方差学习算子来改进ECO算法，这些算子能有效平衡开发和探索，防止种群过早收敛。

Result: IECO-MCO在CEC 2017和CEC 2022测试套件上超越了基本ECO算法和其他竞争算法，在收敛速度、稳定性和避免局部最优能力方面表现优异，平均排名分别为2.213和2.488。

Conclusion: IECO-MCO算法在解决复杂优化问题时表现出优越性能，具有鲁棒性和实际应用价值，统计检验验证了其相对于对比算法的优越性。

Abstract: The educational competition optimizer is a recently introduced metaheuristic
algorithm inspired by human behavior, originating from the dynamics of
educational competition within society. Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due
to an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible
to local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing
complex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study
presents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing
multi-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance
learning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each
operator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing
premature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed
through benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites,
and its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms
across different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses
the basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability,
and the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses,
including the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
are conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared
algorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO
achieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test
suites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO
algorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems. The
experimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of IECO-MCO in
tackling intricate optimization problems, underscoring its robustness and
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: State estimation for linear time-invariant systems with unknown inputs is a
fundamental problem in various research domains. In this article, we establish
conditions for the design of unknown input observers (UIOs) from a geometric
approach perspective. Specifically, we derive a necessary and sufficient
geometric condition for the existence of a centralized UIO. Compared to
existing results, our condition offers a more general design framework,
allowing designers the flexibility to estimate partial information of the
system state. Furthermore, we extend the centralized UIO design to distributed
settings. In contrast to existing distributed UIO approaches, which require
each local node to satisfy the rank condition regarding the unknown input and
output matrices, our method accommodates cases where a subset of nodes does not
meet this requirement. This relaxation significantly broadens the range of
practical applications. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed design.

Abstract: Multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to identify
Pareto-efficient behavior in a multi-agent system, and reconstruct utility
functions of the individual agents. Motivated by the problem of detecting UAV
coordination, how can we construct a statistical detector for Pareto-efficient
behavior given noisy measurements of the decisions of a multi-agent system?
This paper approaches this IRL problem by deriving necessary and sufficient
conditions for a dataset of multi-agent system dynamics to be consistent with
Pareto-efficient coordination, and providing algorithms for recovering utility
functions which are consistent with the system dynamics. We derive an optimal
statistical detector for determining Pareto-efficient coordination from noisy
system measurements, which minimizes Type-I statistical detection error. Then,
we provide a utility estimation algorithm which minimizes the worst-case
estimation error over a statistical ambiguity set centered at empirical
observations; this min-max solution achieves distributionally robust IRL, which
is crucial in adversarial strategic interactions. We illustrate these results
in a detailed example for detecting Pareto-efficient coordination among
multiple UAVs given noisy measurement recorded at a radar. We then reconstruct
the utility functions of the UAVs in a distributionally robust sense.

Abstract: Participation factors (PFs) quantify the interaction between system modes and
state variables, and they play a crucial role in various applications such as
modal analysis, model reduction, and control design. With increasing system
complexity, especially due to power electronic devices and renewable
integration, the need for scalable and high-order nonlinear PF (NPF)
computation has become more critical. This paper presents an efficient
tensor-based method for calculating NPFs up to an arbitrary order. Traditional
computation of PFs directly from normal form theory is computationally
expensive -- even for second-order PFs -- and becomes infeasible for higher
orders due to memory constraints. To address this, a tensor contraction-based
approach is introduced that enables the calculation of high-order PFs using a
batching strategy. The batch sizes are dynamically determined based on the
available computational resources, allowing scalable and memory-efficient
computation.

Abstract: To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, all-electric transportation is a
promising option. In the U.S., the transportation sector contributes the
largest share (29 percent) of greenhouse gas emissions. While electric vehicles
are approaching maturity, aviation is only beginning to develop electrified
aircraft for commercial flights. More than 75 percent of aviation emissions
come from large aircraft, and this impact will worsen with 4-5 percent annual
air travel growth. Aircraft electrification has led to two types: more electric
aircraft (MEA) and all-electric aircraft (AEA). A MEA replaces subsystems such
as hydraulics with electric alternatives, whereas an AEA uses electrically
driven subsystems and provides thrust fully from electrochemical energy units
(EEUs). For wide-body AEA, thrust demand is about 25 MW plus 1 MW for
non-thrust loads, creating major challenges for electric power system (EPS)
design. Achieving maximum power density requires minimizing mass and volume.
Increasing voltage into the kilovolt range using medium-voltage direct current
(MVDC) is a feasible option to enhance power transfer. Consequently, designing
an MVDC EPS for wide-body AEA is critical. Because EPS failures could
jeopardize passenger safety, reliability and resilience are essential. This
chapter presents a load-flow model for DC systems to determine power flows in
both normal and single-contingency conditions, followed by analysis of optimal
MVDC EPS architectures. A complete EPS for wide-body AEA is introduced, with
EEUs and non-propulsion loads located, distances estimated, and flow studies
performed. Multiple architectures are evaluated for reliability, power density,
power loss, and cost to identify optimal solutions.

Abstract: Distribution networks face challenges from the increasing deployment of
Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and the emergence of bidirectional power
flows. We propose a decentralized Volt/VAr control method based on a
saddle-point reformulation and consensus+innovation (C+I) updates. Each agent
at a controllable bus computes and enforces its own set-points using only
neighbor communication. Our method embeds passive buses directly, preserves
network physics through a linearized Jacobian model, and avoids any supervisory
nodes. Simulation results on a modified CIGRE low-voltage network show voltage
stability improvement within operational limits, indicating the viability of a
fully decentralized (edge-based) Volt/VAr control solution.

Abstract: Battery management systems (BMSs) rely on real-time estimation of battery
temperature distribution in battery cells to ensure safe and optimal operation
of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, physical BMS often suffers from
memory and computational resource limitations required by highfidelity models.
Temperature prediction using physics-based models becomes challenging due to
their higher computational time. In contrast, machine learning based approaches
offer faster predictions but demand larger memory overhead. In this work, we
develop a lightweight and efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) based
thermal model, KAN-Therm, to predict the core temperature of a cylindrical
battery. We have compared the memory overhead and computation costs of our
method with Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), and
long shortterm memory (LSTM) network. Our results show that the proposed
KAN-Therm model exhibit the best prediction accuracy with the least memory
overhead and computation time.

Motivation: 现有控制器主要分析小信号/准稳态工况，缺乏大信号或暂态稳定性分析；依赖全局测量和完整电网模型的方法难以实际实现；比例电流共享功能很少被嵌入。

Conclusion: 所提方法超越先前的小信号准稳态分析，无需系统全局数据即可实现电压同步、分散稳定性和比例电流共享。

Abstract: Most previously proposed controllers are analyzed in the
small-signal/quasi-steady regime rather than large-signal or transient
stability for grid-forming inverters (GFMI). Additionally, methods that presume
system-wide data--global measurements and complete grid-model knowledge--are
challenging to realize in practice and unsuitable for large-scale operation.
Moreover, proportional current sharing is rarely embedded into them. The whole
system is a high-order, nonlinear differential system, making analysis
intractable without principled simplifications. Hence, contraction stability
analysis in GFMI is proposed to guarantee the large-signal stability.
Furthermore, a contraction-based controller is proposed to synchronize GFMI.
Additionally, this paper proposes integrating an auxiliary virtual-impedance
layer into the contraction-based controller to achieve proportional current
sharing, while the GFMI retains global stability and voltage synchronization. A
dispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC), also known as the
Andronov--Hopf oscillator (AHO) is used to validate the proposed contraction
stability analysis and contraction-based controller with virtual-impedance. It
is proved that the complex multi-converter system can achieve output-feedback
contraction under large-signal operation. Therefore, without requiring
system-wide data, the proposed method offers voltage synchronization,
decentralized stability conditions for the transient stability of AHO and
proportional current sharing, beyond prior small-signal, quasi-steady analysis.

Abstract: Networked Control Systems (NCSs) have been instrumental in realizing fully
connected and responsive intelligent environments within the context of
real-time virtual control and management. However, traditional NCSs face
considerable challenges in handling the vast amounts of data generated by
large-scale control applications, particularly in terms of data acquisition,

emergence of cloud computing and advancements in control theory have empowered
the new paradigm known as Cloud Control Systems (CCSs). Recently, CCSs have
received substantial attention from industries for their potential properties,
such as large-scale data management, complex computations, and data-centric
optimized decisions. This study presents an extensive review of recent progress
in CCSs spanning over multiple studies published between 2012 and 2025.
Specifically, the focus is on providing a taxonomy of the current findings in
CCS research, encompassing various perspectives, such as its efficient
implementations in industrial automation, security and privacy considerations,
and cloud-based control techniques. Each category is examined in depth through
selected state-of-the-art analyses of different approaches and contrasting
methodologies. Furthermore, we discuss future directions aimed at designing
more efficient and practical CCSs. The insights gained from this study can help

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，为设计者提供了每种方法最适用条件的指导建议。

Abstract: Design under uncertainty is a challenging problem, as a systems performance
can be highly sensitive to variations in input parameters and model
uncertainty. A conventional approach to addressing such problems is robust
optimization, which seeks to enhance design performance by reducing sensitivity
to uncertainty. Alternatively, reliability-based design focuses on optimizing
performance while ensuring that failure constraints are satisfied with a
specified probability. While both methods are well established, their
integration into multi-objective and multi-stakeholder decision-making
frameworks remains a challenging problem. In this study, we extend the
Compromise Decision Support Problem (cDSP) framework to incorporate
reliability-based design considerations and evaluate its performance in
comparison to the conventional robust-based cDSP formulation. The developed
framework has been validated on a multidisciplinary hot rod rolling process
including parametric and model uncertainties. The results compare the predicted
performance under robust and reliable scenarios, validating the efficiency of
the approach in managing uncertainties for complex, multidisciplinary systems.
Specifically, we found that the two methods exhibit markedly different
performance when the predicted performance follows a non-normal distribution, a
situation that arises in non-linear systems with parametric uncertainty. Based
on this insight, we offer guidance to designers on the conditions under which
each method is most appropriate.

Abstract: It is well known that stop-and-go waves can be generated spontaneously in
traffic even without bottlenecks. Can such undesirable traffic patterns,
induced by intrinsic human driving behaviors, be tamed effectively and
inexpensively? Taking advantage of emerging connectivity and autonomy
technologies, we envision a simple yet realistic traffic control system to
achieve this goal. To prove the concept, we design such a system to suppress
these waves while maximizing traffic throughput in the Tadaki setting: a
circular road with varying number of vehicles. We first introduce our driver
behavior model and demonstrate how our calibrated human driving agents can
closely reproduce the observed human driving patterns in the original Tadaki
experiment. We then propose a simple control system mediated via connected
automated vehicles (CAV) whose ideal speed parameter is treated as a
system-level control variable adapted to the local vehicle density of the
traffic. The objective of the control system is set up as a tradeoff:
maximizing throughput while minimizing traffic oscillation. Following
computational mechanism design, we search for the optimal control policy as a
function of vehicle density and the tradeoff attitude parameter. This can be
done by letting all vehicles play a simulated game of CAV-modulated traffic
under such a control system. Our simulation results show that the improvements
in traffic efficiency and smoothness are substantial. Finally, we envision how
such a traffic control system can be realized in an environment with smart
vehicles connected to a smart infrastructure or via a scheme of variable speed
advisory.

Conclusion: 这为通过变速建议控制交通波动提供了数学基础，能够同时提高交通流量和行驶平滑性。

Abstract: We consider a discrete-time dynamical system in a car-following context. The
system was recently introduced to parsimoniously model human driving behavior
based on utility maximization. The parameters of the model were calibrated
using vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. It was shown that
such a system can accurately reproduce the observed collective phenomena of a
more elaborate experiment by Tadaki et al. Once the heterogeneity and noise are
switched off, the model defines a map of the corresponding discrete-time
dynamical system. We first perform a bifurcation analysis of the map by
studying the stability of its limit solutions: a free-flow fixed point and a
stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. When the vehicle density is varied, our model
displays a bifurcation diagram qualitatively similar to those found in a class
of optimal velocity models based on an ordinary differential equation approach,
including regimes where one or both of the limit solutions are stable. In a 2D
bifurcation diagram we further demonstrate that imposing a vehicle
density-dependent speed advisory can dissipate the stop-and-go quasi-periodic
orbit. This in turn lays the mathematical foundation for a simple, yet
effective proposal [1] to tame stop-and-go waves, improving traffic flow and
smoothness simultaneously via variable speed advisory.

Abstract: A generic data-assisted control architecture within the port-Hamiltonian
framework is proposed, introducing a physically meaningful observable that
links conservative dynamics to all actuation, dissipation, and disturbance
channels. A robust, model-based controller combined with a high-gain
decentralized integrator establishes large robustness margins and strict
time-scale separation, ensuring that subsequent learning cannot destabilize the
primary dynamics. Learning, selected for its generalizability, is then applied
to capture complex, unmodeled effects, despite inherent delay and transient
error during adaptation. Formal Lyapunov analysis with explicit stability
bounds guarantees convergence under bounded learning errors. The structured
design confines learning to the simplest part of the dynamics, enhancing data
efficiency while preserving physical interpretability. The approach is generic,
with a free-floating space manipulator orientation control task, including
integrated null-space collision avoidance, serving as a case study to
demonstrate robust tracking performance and applicability to broader robotic
domains.

Conclusion: 该学习变体方法成功地将机器学习与经典控制理论相结合，在保持理论保证的同时显著提升了网络性能

Abstract: The drift-plus-penalty method is a Lyapunov optimisation technique commonly
applied to network routing problems. It reduces the original stochastic
planning task to a sequence of greedy optimizations, enabling the design of
distributed routing algorithms which stabilize data queues while simultaneously
optimizing a specified penalty function. While drift-plus-penalty methods have
desirable asymptotic properties, they tend to incur higher network delay than
alternative control methods, especially under light network load. In this work,
we propose a learned variant of the drift-plus-penalty method that can preserve
its theoretical guarantees, while being flexible enough to learn routing
strategies directly from a model of the problem. Our approach introduces a
novel mechanism for learning routing decisions and employs an optimal
transport-based method for link scheduling. Applied to the joint task of
transmit-power allocation and data routing, the method achieves consistent
improvements over common baselines under a broad set of scenarios.

Abstract: Harmonic decomposition of surfaces, such as spherical and spheroidal
harmonics, is used to analyze morphology, reconstruct, and generate surface
inclusions of particulate microstructures. However, obtaining high-quality
meshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open
question. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating
the harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base
domains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional
sampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis
functions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or
generation. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality
discretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical
simulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent
this issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for
resampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an
equalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear
diffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain,
thereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on
surfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent
spheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods. The results show a substantial
improvement in the quality metrics for surface triangulation. Unlike
traditional surface reconstruction and meshing techniques, this approach
preserves surface morphology, along with the areas and volumes of surfaces. We
discuss the results and the associated computational costs for large 2D and 3D
microstructures, such as digital twins of concrete and stone masonry, and their
future applications.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical
for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional
display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a
model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they
fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer
sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and
photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined
with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to
be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a
combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference
predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and
visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image
stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,
homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function
as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual
Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli
under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the
proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel
detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our
uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper
bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals
for VDP quality scores.

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统复合材料制造方法无法实现复杂三维结构设计，并存在接头弱点和纤维连续性问题，限制了空天航天和机器人领域轻量化高强度结构的发展

Method: 采用3D纤维综网(3DFiT)技术，使用连续单纽纤维构建面心立方格子结构，确保精确的纤维排列和消除传统组装式复合材料的弱点

Result: 制造的无人机架体仅重260克，比商用DJI F450架轻10%，比强度是金属和土急性材料的4-8倍，飞行时间延长3分钟，飞行测试证明其稳定性和耐用性

Conclusion: 单纽格子架构无人机架体具有巨大潜力，3DFiT技术作为一种可扩展的高效制造方法，为轻量化高强度复合结构的制造提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly
growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames.
However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve
complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate
components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally,
maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting
structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face
Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for
weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering
(3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment,
eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly.
Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high
specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic,
outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs
only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing
structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three
minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under
operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow
lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and
efficient manufacturing method.

*Alice Kate Li,Thales C Silva,Victoria Edwards,Vijay Kumar,M. Ani Hsieh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KoopMotion是一种基于流场的运动规划方法，使用Koopman算子理论来学习期望轨迹的运动流场，确保机器人从任意初始状态收敛到参考轨迹的终点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Koopman算子理论在建模动力系统方面有效，但它本身不能保证收敛到期望轨迹或指定目标，这在从演示中学习(LfD)时是必需的。

Method: 将运动流场表示为动力系统，用Koopman算子参数化来模仿期望轨迹，利用学习到的流场的发散特性获得平滑的运动场，使机器人能够收敛到参考轨迹并跟踪到终点。

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上评估显示高效性，物理机器人实验验证了在非静态流体环境中的性能。仅需3%的LASA数据集就能生成密集运动规划，在时空动态建模指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KoopMotion提供了一种样本高效的流场运动规划方法，能够确保机器人收敛到期望轨迹，在复杂环境中表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低驱动变形机制在需要高效适应性装载解决方案中的实际潜力，通用的建模和优化框架可扩展到更广泛的操纵器类型，为需要效率、灵活性和稳健性能的机器人系统开发提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive
actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This
study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading
manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive
gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the
topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional
actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to
diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed,
and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping
configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is
utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust
adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the
UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and
effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work
underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in
applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the
specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends
to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the
development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过LIPM理论指导的奖励设计和动态权衡机制，有效提升了双足机器人在复杂户外环境中的稳定性和适应能力。

Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in
unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex
terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we
propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
(LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM
provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of
mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for
terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the
robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that
promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM
trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and
stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes
stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately
evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and
robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal
robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results
demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and
consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.

Conclusion: AEOS框架通过生物启发的自适应扫描策略，有效解决了复杂遮挡环境中LiDAR惯性里程计的性能退化问题，实现了计算效率和高精度的平衡

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D perception and localization on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are fundamentally limited by the narrow field of view (FoV) of compact LiDAR
sensors and the payload constraints that preclude multi-sensor configurations.
Traditional motorized scanning systems with fixed-speed rotations lack scene
awareness and task-level adaptability, leading to degraded odometry and mapping
performance in complex, occluded environments. Inspired by the active sensing
behavior of owls, we propose AEOS (Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning),
a biologically inspired and computationally efficient framework for adaptive
LiDAR control in UAV-based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO). AEOS combines model
predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) in a hybrid
architecture: an analytical uncertainty model predicts future pose
observability for exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an
implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to guide exploration. To
support scalable training and generalization, we develop a point cloud-based
simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps across diverse scenes,
enabling sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments demonstrate that AEOS significantly improves odometry
accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned
baselines, while maintaining real-time performance under onboard computational
constraints. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: 该方法通过系统性地预测未来停车位可用性和智能策略规划，为自主代客停车提供了更高效、更安全的解决方案

Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated
planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking
in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on
instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that
predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between
initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of
dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that
incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View
(FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions.
Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances
goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on
information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at
promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots,
we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency,
safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion in outdoor environments presents significant
challenges for quadruped robots. Accurate environmental prediction and
effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain
difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To
address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter
proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework
employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance
while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through
an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between
estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental
validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in
complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with
degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a
practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

Conclusion: VLA-Adapter成功降低了VLA模型的部署门槛，提供了一种高效、轻量级的视觉-语言-动作桥接范式

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between
perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design,
making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments.
However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation
and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural
failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots
remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we
propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a
Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and
bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,
while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress
magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains
motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect
corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and
(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor
torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional
sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation
by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical
limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of
structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.

Abstract: Advancing research in fields like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) and autonomous navigation critically depends on reliable and
reproducible multimodal datasets. While several influential datasets have
driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing
modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying
hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a
novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not
limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR,
multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and
synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across
modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its
capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted
scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release
SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative
indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized
multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based
SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions.
Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR
and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining
open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive
benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM
algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Detecting incipient slip enables early intervention to prevent object
slippage and enhance robotic manipulation safety. However, deploying such
systems on edge platforms remains challenging, particularly due to energy
constraints. This work presents a neuromorphic tactile sensing system based on
the NeuroTac sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin and a spiking
convolutional neural network (SCNN) for slip-state classification. The SCNN
model achieves 94.33% classification accuracy across three classes (no slip,
incipient slip, and gross slip) in slip conditions induced by sensor motion.
Under the dynamic gravity-induced slip validation conditions, after temporal
smoothing of the SCNN's final-layer spike counts, the system detects incipient
slip at least 360 ms prior to gross slip across all trials, consistently
identifying incipient slip before gross slip occurs. These results demonstrate
that this neuromorphic system has stable and responsive incipient slip
detection capability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于对象相对控制的新视觉导航方法ObjectReact，通过使用对象级别表征替代传统的图像级别表征，实现了更好的跨体验部署和路径反向导航能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像相对控制方法存在限制，图像与代理体姿态和体验绑定很紧，而对象作为地图属性提供了体验和轨迹无关的世界表征。

Method: 提出了一种基于"相对3D场景图"的顶度地图表征，用于获取更信息丰富的对象级全局路径规划成本。训练了一个直接条件于高级"WayObject Costmap"表征的本地控制器ObjectReact，消除了显式RGB输入的需求。

Result: 在传感器高度变化和多种导航任务中，对象相对控制方法在底层空间理解能力方面显示出明显优势，包括可以在反向轨迹上导航。仅使用模拟器训练的策略能够艾好地沿用到真实室内环境。

Conclusion: 对象相对控制为单直摄像头视觉导航提供了一种更加稳健和灵活的方案，具有更好的体验不变性和路径反向导航能力，为实际部署提供了更大的灵活性。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

TL;DR: 开发了能够全身膨胀收缩的机器人MOFU，研究发现膨胀收缩运动能显著增强机器人感知的生命感，是未来机器人设计的重要元素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有治疗和社交机器人主要模仿外观和关节运动，但忽视了生物体中观察到的全身膨胀收缩这种体积变化运动对生命感感知的影响

Method: 开发MOFU机器人（采用Jitterbug结构实现单电机驱动的全身膨胀收缩），通过在线视频调查使用Godspeed问卷评估膨胀收缩运动对生命感感知的影响

Result: 膨胀收缩运动显著提高感知生命感；双机器人设置未显著增加生命感；膨胀收缩与运动结合比单独运动产生更高生命感评分

Conclusion: 体积变化运动如膨胀收缩能增强机器人感知的生命感，应作为未来塑造人类印象的机器人设计中的重要设计元素

Abstract: Robots for therapy and social interaction are often intended to evoke
"animacy" in humans. While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements,
little attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction,
volume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on
animacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called "MOFU (Morphing Fluffy
Unit)," capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and
covered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a "Jitterbug" structure, a
geometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in
diameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a
differential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect
of expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos
of MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed
Questionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state
with and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that
expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we
hypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a
single robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference
emerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion
conditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,
animacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that
volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived
animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in
future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.

TL;DR: Dexplore是一个统一的单循环优化方法，直接从大规模手-物运动捕捉数据中学习机器人控制策略，避免了传统三阶段工作流程的误差累积问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用重定向、跟踪和残差校正的三阶段工作流程，存在演示数据利用不足和误差累积的问题，且人类演示的不准确性和人-机器人手之间的本体差异限制了数据的直接使用

Method: 提出统一单循环优化，将重定向和跟踪联合进行；将演示作为软指导而非绝对真值；从原始轨迹推导自适应空间范围；使用强化学习训练策略保持在范围内同时最小化控制努力和完成任务

Result: 统一公式保留了演示意图，使机器人特定策略得以出现，提高了对噪声的鲁棒性，并能扩展到大型演示语料库；还将跟踪策略提炼为基于视觉的技能条件生成控制器

Conclusion: Dexplore提供了一个原则性的桥梁，将不完美的演示转化为灵巧操作的有效训练信号，支持跨物体泛化和真实世界部署

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL
