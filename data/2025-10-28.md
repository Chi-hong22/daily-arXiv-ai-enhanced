### [1] [Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cramér-Rao Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分渲染器的相机位姿估计协方差下界计算方法，通过将渲染器视为测量函数，在流形上线性化图像形成过程，得到渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位姿估计在计算机视觉和机器人领域至关重要，但现有工作很少对密集或学习模型下的位姿提供严格的不确定性量化。

Method: 将可微分渲染器作为测量函数，在流形上对小的位姿扰动进行图像形成过程的线性化，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。

Result: 该方法可还原为经典的捆绑调整不确定性，确保与视觉理论的连续性，并能自然地扩展到多智能体设置中融合不同相机的Fisher信息。

Conclusion: 这种统计公式在下游任务如协作感知和无需显式关键点对应关系的新视角合成中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

### [2] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU是一个数据可视化理解任务套件，用于诊断视觉语言模型在理解数据可视化时的失败原因。研究发现错误主要源于视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题，而非视觉编码器本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在基本的数据可视化理解任务上表现不佳，但失败原因尚不清楚。研究旨在确定错误是源于视觉信息编码、视觉-语言模块间信息传递，还是语言模块内部处理的问题。

Method: 开发FUGU任务套件来精确识别困难来源，使用激活修补和线性探针技术追踪信息流，测试三种广泛使用的视觉语言模型，并分析不同提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型经常无法正确生成单个数据点的坐标，这些初始错误导致最终回答错误。当提供正确坐标时性能显著提升，即使模型回答错误，正确坐标仍可从视觉编码器的潜在表示中读取，表明问题在于视觉-语言交接。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型存在架构限制，在可靠的数据可视化理解方面面临重大挑战。即使提供正确坐标或进行微调，也无法达到理想性能，特别是在需要提取多个数据点统计关系的任务中。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [3] [Improving the Physics of Video Generation with VJEPA-2 Reward Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21840)
*Jianhao Yuan,Xiaofeng Zhang,Felix Friedrich,Nicolas Beltran-Velez,Melissa Hall,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat,Xiaochuang Han,Nicolas Ballas,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该报告介绍了在ICCV 2025感知测试研讨会上获得PhysicsIQ挑战赛冠军的方案，通过将VJEPA-2作为奖励信号来指导MAGI-1视频生成模型，提升了约6%的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视频生成模型在物理理解方面存在严重限制，经常产生不合理的视频。视觉真实性并不等同于物理理解，而自监督学习在自然视频上的预训练已显示出直觉物理理解能力。

Method: 基于最先进的视频生成模型MAGI-1，结合最近提出的视频联合嵌入预测架构2(VJEPA-2)来指导生成过程，利用VJEPA-2作为奖励信号。

Result: 通过使用VJEPA-2作为奖励信号，能够将最先进视频生成模型的物理合理性提升约6%。

Conclusion: 利用SSL基础的视频世界模型可以有效提高视频生成模型的物理合理性，证明了自监督学习在改善生成模型物理理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

### [4] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自一致性的成本效益框架，通过语义聚类和余弦相似度共识机制，提高视觉语言模型在农业图像描述中的可靠性，在PlantVillage数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家农业病害管理面临专家资源有限、网络连接不可靠和成本约束等挑战，需要开发成本效益高且可靠的AI系统来辅助农业病害诊断。

Method: 采用语义聚类方法，使用轻量级预训练嵌入模型对多个候选响应进行分组，通过余弦相似度选择最一致的描述；结合人机交互组件，用户确认作物类型以过滤错误生成。

Result: 在800张作物病害图像上测试，单聚类共识方法在10个候选生成时达到83.1%的准确率，优于贪婪解码的77.5%；多聚类情况下，前4个候选聚类的准确率提升至94.0%。

Conclusion: 该自一致性框架有效提高了视觉语言模型在农业图像描述任务中的可靠性，为资源受限环境下的农业病害管理提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

### [5] [LSF-Animation: Label-Free Speech-Driven Facial Animation via Implicit Feature Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21864)
*Xin Lu,Chuanqing Zhuang,Chenxi Jin,Zhengda Lu,Yiqun Wang,Wu Liu,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSF-Animation是一种无需显式情感和身份标签的语音驱动3D面部动画框架，通过从语音中隐式提取情感信息和从中性面部网格中捕获身份特征，实现了对未见说话者和情感状态的更好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式的独热编码来表示身份和情感，限制了向未见说话者的泛化能力，且忽略了语音中固有的情感线索，影响了生成动画的自然性和适应性。

Method: 提出LSF-Animation框架，隐式从语音中提取情感信息，从中性面部网格中捕获身份特征；引入分层交互融合块(HIFB)，使用融合令牌整合双变换器特征，更有效地融合情感、运动和身份相关线索。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在情感表现力、身份泛化能力和动画真实感方面超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过消除对显式情感和身份特征表示的依赖，实现了更好的泛化能力和更自然的动画生成，为语音驱动的3D面部动画提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

### [6] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两个专门用于艺术控制的ControlNet：比例ControlNet使用边界框控制物体位置和大小，透视ControlNet使用消失线控制场景3D几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像扩散模型生成高保真图像，但对输出的空间和几何结构控制有限。

Method: 开发了两个ControlNet模块：比例ControlNet使用边界框控制物体位置和比例，透视ControlNet使用消失线控制3D场景几何。利用视觉语言模型进行数据标注和专门的算法进行条件图像合成。

Result: 实验表明两个模块都提供了有效控制，但在复杂约束下存在局限性。

Conclusion: 两个模型在HuggingFace上发布，为艺术创作提供了更好的空间和几何控制能力。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [7] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow是一个无需人工标注、仅使用合成数据的3D人机交互感知框架，通过密集扩散过程学习点云上的3D流表示，全面建模接触、方向和空间占用等交互属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖人工标注数据集、局限于接触分析而忽略方向和空间占用等关键交互属性的问题。

Method: 使用3D生成模型生成合成数据，通过密集扩散过程在点云上学习3D流表示，全面学习接触、方向和空间占用等交互属性。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中，H2OFlow能有效泛化到真实世界对象，在3D交互感知建模方面超越依赖人工标注或网格表示的方法。

Conclusion: H2OFlow证明了仅使用合成数据就能全面学习3D人机交互感知，为计算机视觉、机器人和AI中的交互理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

### [8] [MOGRAS: Human Motion with Grasping in 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22199)
*Kunal Bhosikar,Siddharth Katageri,Vivek Madhavaram,Kai Han,Charu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOGRAS是一个大规模数据集，用于生成在3D场景中物理合理的全身抓取运动，填补了现有方法在场景感知抓取运动生成方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么能生成3D场景中的全身运动但缺乏精细抓取能力，要么能生成精确抓取动作但忽略3D场景，需要解决在3D场景中生成物理合理的全身抓取运动这一挑战。

Method: 提出了MOGRAS数据集，包含预抓取全身行走运动和最终抓取姿势，并提出了简单有效的方法来适配现有方法在3D场景中工作。

Result: 通过大量定量和定性实验验证了数据集的有效性，并展示了所提方法带来的显著改进。

Conclusion: MOGRAS数据集和适配方法为更真实的人-场景交互铺平了道路。

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

### [10] [VoMP: Predicting Volumetric Mechanical Property Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22975)
*Rishit Dagli,Donglai Xiang,Vismay Modi,Charles Loop,Clement Fuji Tsang,Anka He Chen,Anita Hu,Gavriel State,David I. W. Levin,Maria Shugrina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoMP是一种前馈方法，通过多视图特征和几何变换器预测3D物体的体积材料属性（杨氏模量、泊松比、密度），基于真实世界材料数据集学习物理合理的材料流形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理模拟通常依赖手工制作的空间变化力学属性，过程繁琐。需要自动预测3D物体体积材料属性的方法。

Method: 使用多视图特征聚合和几何变换器预测每个体素的材料潜在编码，这些编码位于从真实世界数据集学习的物理合理材料流形上。提出结合分割3D数据集、材料数据库和视觉语言模型的标注流程。

Result: VoMP能够准确估计体积属性，在准确性和速度上远超现有方法。

Conclusion: VoMP提供了一种有效的自动预测3D物体体积材料属性的方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

### [11] [Face-MakeUpV2: Facial Consistency Learning for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21775)
*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2是一个面部图像生成模型，通过构建大规模数据集和引入3D面部渲染通道，解决了当前文本到图像模型在面部属性泄漏和物理一致性方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在响应局部语义指令时存在面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题，需要开发能够保持面部ID和物理特征一致性的生成模型。

Method: 1. 构建包含约100万图像-文本-掩码对的大规模数据集FaceCaptionMask-1M；2. 使用通用文本到图像预训练模型作为主干，引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道；3. 设计语义对齐和感知损失两个优化目标。

Result: 大量实验表明，Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和参考图像物理一致性方面实现了最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2在可靠和可控的面部编辑应用中具有实际潜力。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合重光照框架，结合扩散模型导出的材质先验与时域正则化，实现更稳定的体积视频重光照效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在体积视频重光照中存在时间稳定性不足的问题，扩散方法在单帧表现良好但在序列中会产生随机噪声和不稳定性，而视频扩散模型受限于内存和规模

Method: 结合扩散导出的材质先验与时域正则化，通过光流引导的正则化将多帧材质属性聚合成时间一致的着色分量，并使用高斯不透明度场提取网格代理进行物理渲染

Result: 在真实和合成捕获数据上的实验表明，该方法比纯扩散基线在序列重光照中具有显著更高的稳定性，且能扩展到超出视频扩散可行范围的长度

Conclusion: 混合方法在平衡学习先验与物理约束方面是迈向生产级体积视频重光照的实用步骤

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

### [13] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了紧凑二进制人脸模板的长期稳定性，量化了年龄漂移为每十年1.357位（64位模板）和2.571位（128位模板），表明随着时间推移存在系统性的类内距离增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究紧凑二进制人脸模板的长期稳定性，为智能卡和片上匹配部署提供理论支持，量化年龄变化对模板匹配性能的影响。

Method: 使用现代人脸CNN提取浮点嵌入，通过PCA-ITQ压缩为64位和128位二进制码。对AgeDB数据集中每个至少有3个不同年龄的身份，构建所有真实对并拟合汉明距离与绝对年龄差的线性模型。

Result: 在566个身份中，64位模板的年龄漂移中位数为每十年1.357位，128位模板为每十年2.571位。漂移分布主要为正，表明类内距离随时间系统性增加。较短的代码在固定决策阈值下具有更好的年龄稳定性。

Conclusion: 二进制人脸模板存在可量化的年龄漂移，代码长度影响漂移程度。提出了定期重新注册和针对不稳定位位置的目标奇偶校验等简单缓解措施。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

Result: 大量实验表明，相比最先进方法，TIRE方法在3D/4D生成中显著改善了身份保持能力。

Conclusion: TIRE方法为3D/4D生成中的身份保持问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

### [15] [Bridging Accuracy and Interpretability: Deep Learning with XAI for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21780)
*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的深度学习框架，用于通过细针穿刺图像特征进行乳腺癌早期检测，在保持高准确率的同时提供模型解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在临床应用中因黑盒特性而难以被采纳的问题，需要在保持高预测准确性的同时提供可解释性。

Method: 使用深度神经网络（ReLU激活函数、Adam优化器、二元交叉熵损失），结合SHAP和LIME等模型无关的可解释AI技术来生成特征级归因和可视化。

Result: 实现了0.992的准确率、1.000的精确率、0.977的召回率和0.988的F1分数，显著优于传统机器学习算法，并识别出细胞核凹点特征为最重要的分类特征。

Conclusion: 该框架成功平衡了性能与可解释性，为乳腺癌临床诊断提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案，细胞核凹点特征的发现有助于改进诊断和治疗策略。

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync是一种高效的边缘模型更新方法，通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，解决实时视频分析中模型精度下降和更新延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频分析系统在边缘设备部署轻量模型以减少延迟，但数据特征分布随时间变化（如光照、天气条件变化）导致模型精度下降。现有方法存在重训练计算密集导致更新延迟，以及新模型与当前视频流数据分布不匹配的问题。

Method: EdgeSync引入高效的边缘模型更新方法：1）通过结合时效性和推理结果改进样本过滤，确保训练样本与当前视频内容更相关；2）动态训练管理模块优化模型更新的时间和顺序以提高时效性。

Result: 在多样复杂的真实世界数据集上的评估显示，EdgeSync相比现有方法准确率提升约3.4%，相比传统方法提升约10%。

Conclusion: EdgeSync通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，有效解决了边缘模型更新中的延迟和精度问题，显著提升了实时视频分析系统的性能。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面评估SAM2变体在火焰分割任务中的表现，重点研究边界框提示策略以提升部署可行性。研究发现边界框提示优于自动和单点方法，轻量级变体更适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割在计算机视觉中具有挑战性，而SAM/SAM2模型的跨域泛化能力在火焰分割特别是移动部署约束下的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 系统评估四种SAM2.1变体和移动导向变体，使用多种提示策略（自动、单点、多点、边界框及混合策略）在三个火焰数据集上进行测试。

Result: 边界框提示方法表现最佳，Box+MP在Khan数据集上获得最高平均IoU(0.64)和Dice系数(0.75)。轻量级变体显著降低内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该研究为在火焰监测系统中部署可提示分割模型提供了关键见解，并为领域特定SAM应用建立了基准。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推理攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并分析噪声分布的聚合程度来区分训练集样本和非训练集样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的广泛使用带来了隐私风险，特别是成员推理攻击可能泄露训练数据信息。

Method: 基于噪声注入和噪声分布聚合度评估，利用扩散模型对训练集和非训练集样本的噪声预测模式差异进行攻击。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上表现优异，在大规模文本到图像扩散模型中ASR和AUC指标更好，证明了方法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的成员推理攻击方法高效且可扩展，仅需较少次数的模型访问即可实现优越的攻击性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AVEP任务和EventFormer模型，用于视频事件预测，构建了包含3.5万标注视频的大型数据集，在复杂逻辑和语义信息方面优于现有视频预测方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类事件多以视频形式记录而非文本脚本，但在视觉领域缺乏相关研究，需要解决视频事件预测的挑战

Method: 提出EventFormer模型，采用节点-图层次注意力机制，能捕捉事件与参数之间的关系以及参数间的共指关系

Result: 在AVEP任务上，提出的方法优于多种最先进的视频预测模型和LVLMs，证明了任务的复杂性和数据集的价值

Conclusion: AVEP任务具有挑战性，EventFormer模型能有效处理复杂事件结构，构建的数据集为视频事件预测研究提供了重要资源

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模光纤成像需要测量值与测量矩阵严格匹配才能重建图像，但实际应用中由于系统配置未知或光纤弯曲后难以实时对准，导致传统重建算法失效。

Method: 提出失配方程，设计匹配和校准解决方案算法来构建新的测量矩阵，并提供了详细的数学证明。

Result: 实验结果表明，在低噪声水平下，构建的矩阵可用于传统重建算法中的匹配对，成功重建原始图像。算法对噪声、计算精度和正交性具有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该理论解决了测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题，具有实际应用价值，但存在局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Conclusion: MAFR为融合视觉和几何信息提供了原则性方法，提升了工业异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

TL;DR: 提出了TITA框架，通过冻结基础视觉语言模型并训练奖励模型，在推理时提供token级别的对齐信号，有效减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的输出容易出现与视觉输入不符的幻觉问题，而现有的对齐方法要么需要昂贵的微调，要么只能提供粗粒度的反馈。

Method: TITA框架冻结基础VLM，训练奖励模型来近似其分布，在推理时提取隐式偏好信号作为奖励模型和目标VLM之间的对数概率比，提供密集的自回归反馈。

Result: 在多个模型上的广泛评估显示，在12个基准测试中均获得一致提升，MMVet提升8.6%，POPE提升6.7%，幻觉显著减少，推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: TITA作为一种轻量级推理时对齐框架，能有效增强模型理解能力并减少幻觉，在不同规模的VLM上都表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型直接迁移语言模型架构，难以有效捕捉时间序列数据固有的多尺度时间依赖关系，特别是在零样本跨数据集迁移时表现受限。

Method: 提出HIBA架构，使用分层交错块稀疏注意力：块内注意力促进局部信息交换，块间注意力捕捉全局时间模式交互和动态演化。基于此构建Xihe模型家族，参数规模从950万到15亿。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval基准测试中，最小模型Xihe-tiny（9.5M）超越多数现有TSFM，最大模型Xihe-max（1.5B）在零样本性能上创下新记录，大幅超越先前最佳结果。

Conclusion: HIBA架构具有卓越的泛化能力和架构优势，Xihe模型家族在整个参数范围内都表现出色，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

Motivation: 在有限去噪步骤（扩散模型评估次数受限）的情况下，如何提高采样图像的质量。

Method: 使用两个并行采样器在连续时间步进行去噪，并适当整合它们的潜在图像信息。方法简单易实现，无需额外微调或外部模型。

Result: 通过自动化和人工评估验证了该方法对不同扩散模型的有效性，但发现朴素的信息整合会降低采样质量，且增加更多并行采样器不一定能进一步提升质量。

Conclusion: 在有限去噪步骤下，两个并行采样器的适当信息整合能有效提升扩散模型的采样质量，但需要精心设计整合策略。

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法依赖大规模标注数据且存在模态鸿沟问题，现有CLIP适配方法缺乏对动态视频特征的增强和静态冗余特征的抑制。

Method: 使用帧差生成动态区域掩码，作为Alpha通道输入Alpha-CLIP，引导模型关注语义关键的动态区域并抑制静态背景冗余。

Result: 实验证明帧差引导的视频语义编码能有效平衡检索效率和准确性。

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP通过动态区域掩码机制成功解决了视频动态特征增强和静态冗余特征抑制的问题，提升了文本-视频检索性能。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的微调任务MPCC，通过遮挡图像重建来增强多模态模型的视觉上下文和常识推理能力，并开发了RFPS训练方法来提升模型的泛化推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理模型主要关注单模态语言任务，在多模态场景特别是视觉语言任务中存在适应不足的问题，无法充分利用视觉上下文和常识知识，限制了跨多模态环境的泛化推理能力。

Method: 提出了MPCC微调任务，通过重建遮挡图像的语义内容来整合视觉上下文和常识推理；开发了RFPS训练方法，结合先验采样来增强模型性能；建立了MPCC Eval评估基准。

Result: 该方法有效提升了模型在多模态环境中的推理能力，特别是在OOD和跨任务场景下表现出更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MPCC任务和RFPS训练方法为多模态模型提供了有效的泛化推理基础，解决了当前模型在视觉语言任务中推理能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了SRE-CLIP适配器框架，通过语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，解决了DAZSL中CLIP模型的两个核心挑战，在I2AwA和I2WebV基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注成本高昂，现有方法无法平衡跨域迁移和跨类别泛化，需要Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL)。虽然CLIP模型在DAZSL领域具有固有优势，但当前研究未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出了Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter框架，包含语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，解决跨类别知识转移效率低和跨模态对齐退化问题。

Result: 在I2AwA和I2WebV基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP是首个基于CLIP的DAZSL方法，成功解决了CLIP在DAZSL应用中的核心挑战，实现了优异的跨域和跨类别性能。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出一种在强化学习导航中集成语言描述动作的辅助任务方法，通过知识蒸馏解决缺乏真实数据的问题，在保持高性能的同时实现可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人导航系统决策过程不透明的问题，在保持高性能的同时实现可解释性，克服可解释系统性能通常低于非可解释系统的权衡问题。

Method: 将动作语言描述作为强化学习导航的辅助任务，利用预训练描述生成模型（如视觉语言模型）进行知识蒸馏，解决缺乏真实数据的问题。

Result: 在各种导航任务中全面评估，证明方法能够在描述动作的同时保持高导航性能，在语义视听导航任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过将语言描述集成到强化学习中，成功实现了高性能且可解释的机器人导航系统，突破了可解释性与性能之间的传统权衡。

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是糖尿病的主要并发症，早期无症状但会导致不可逆视力丧失。印度等糖尿病高发地区急需准确、可扩展的筛查方法。

Method: 采用混合诊断框架，结合传统手工特征提取（捕捉关键临床标记）和深度学习（自动化分层模式识别），将可解释的临床数据与学习特征相融合。

Result: 该模型超越了单独的深度学习方法，展示了优越的分类性能并减少了假阴性，实现了更准确的DR筛查。

Conclusion: 这种多模态AI驱动方法能够实现可扩展、准确的DR筛查，对糖尿病负担重的地区至关重要。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

Conclusion: YOLOv11凭借其出色的准确性和速度，成为NEU数据集上表面缺陷检测的最有效模型，显著优于其他竞争算法。

Abstract: This article compares the performance of six prominent object detection
algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,
speed, and robustness across different defect types such as scratches,
inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other
methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This
improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction
capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet通过可训练的理性小波变换前端增强TCFormer骨干网络，在BCI-IV-2a和BCI-IV-2b数据集上显著提升了最差受试者的分类准确率，同时保持了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于运动想象的脑机接口在非侵入式EEG信号解码中面临非平稳性、低信噪比和受试者变异性的挑战，特别是在最差受试者上表现不佳。

Method: 提出RatioWaveNet，包含可训练的理性小波变换前端进行多分辨率子带分解，结合多核CNN提取局部时空特征，分组查询注意力编码器捕获长程上下文，以及紧凑TCN头进行因果时序整合。

Result: 在BCI-IV-2a数据集上，最差受试者准确率提升+0.17/+0.42个百分点（受试者依赖/留一受试者外），在BCI-IV-2b上提升+1.07/+2.54个百分点，平均性能也有稳定提升。

Conclusion: 简单的可训练小波前端是增强基于Transformer的脑机接口的有效插件，能在不牺牲效率的情况下提高最差情况下的可靠性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SITS-DECO是一个基于GPT风格解码器架构的生成式地球观测基础模型，通过统一序列框架处理多任务和多模态数据，在作物分类任务上优于更大的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球观测基础模型需要额外适配且结构僵化，受大型语言模型启发，希望通过统一序列框架简化EO数据的使用。

Method: 采用GPT风格解码器架构，通过符号提示在单一统一架构中执行多个监督和自监督任务，无需任务或模态特定适配。

Result: 尽管架构简单且缺乏空间上下文，SITS-DECO在作物类型分类任务上优于更大的EO基础模型，证明了密集时间序列建模的重要性。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一种以数据为中心的建模范式，能力源于训练数据的多样性和结构而非架构复杂性，为未来生成式EO基础模型提供了概念桥梁。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GestureGPT解决方案在识别准确性和响应时间方面存在局限，无法满足自由手势理解的需求。自由手势理解能够解放用户，使其无需受限于预定义的手势类别。

Method: 1) 使用预训练大视觉语言模型对齐动态多样的自由手势模式与高层语义概念；2) 引入手部关键点处理模块，通过嵌入解剖学手部先验知识来捕捉细微手部动作；3) 采用思维链推理策略进行逐步语义推理，将浅层知识转化为深度语义理解。

Result: Gestura实现了稳健且适应性强的自由手势理解能力。同时开发了首个开源自由手势意图推理和理解数据集，包含超过30万个标注的问答对。

Conclusion: Gestura通过结合大视觉语言模型、手部关键点处理和思维链推理，显著提升了自由手势理解的性能，为更自然的人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

TL;DR: 提出了egoEMOTION数据集，这是首个结合自我中心视觉和生理信号与密集情感和人格自我报告的数据集，包含50+小时记录，定义了三个基准任务：连续情感分类、离散情感分类和人格特质推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自我中心视觉基准主要忽略影响人类决策和行动的情感状态，假设中性情感和统一人格，限制了视觉系统捕捉行为关键内在驱动因素的能力。

Method: 使用Meta的Project Aria眼镜收集43名参与者的同步眼动追踪视频、头戴式光电容积描记、惯性运动数据和生理基线，参与者完成情感诱发任务和自然活动，使用Circumplex模型和Mikels轮进行情感自我报告，使用大五模型进行人格自我报告。

Result: 基于经典学习方法在真实世界情感预测中，从自我中心视觉系统捕获的信号比处理生理信号产生更好的估计。

Conclusion: 该数据集将情感和人格确立为自我中心感知的核心维度，为行为、意图和交互的情感驱动建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

Motivation: 分析AI图像生成模型是否准确呈现提示中明确指定的属性，以评估模型保真度及其对偏见检测和模型评估的影响。

Method: 使用两个公共数据集（200张文化创意产业女性工作者和230张博物馆策展人图像），评估个人属性（年龄、头发）、外观（着装、眼镜）和随身物品（名牌、剪贴板）的渲染准确性。

Result: DALL-E3在15.6%的属性（n=710）中偏离提示规范，随身物品错误率最低，个人外观中等，人物本身描绘（特别是年龄）错误率最高。

Conclusion: 研究证明了可测量的提示到图像保真度差距，这对偏见检测和模型评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成图像的检测在数字图像取证中面临重大挑战，需要开发有效的检测方法来区分真实图像和GAN生成图像。

Method: 使用离散小波变换(DWT)预处理，应用Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器将图像转换为多分辨率表示，然后输入ResNet50网络进行分类。

Result: Haar和Daubechies预处理模型的准确率分别达到93.8%和95.1%，显著高于空间域模型的81.5%。Daubechies模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: GAN生成图像在小波域具有独特的伪影特征，小波域分析是检测GAN图像的有效方法，为未来深度伪造检测系统的发展提供了潜力。

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像诊断中潜力巨大，但大多数模型缺乏可解释性，阻碍了临床信任和采用。需要开发既准确又可解释的诊断工具。

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet121卷积神经网络，在Kaggle公开数据集（7,023张脑部MRI和5,863张胸部X光）上进行训练，并集成Grad-CAM生成热力图可视化。

Result: DenseNet121表现更优：脑肿瘤检测准确率94.3%（vs ResNet50 92.5%），肺炎检测准确率89.1%（vs ResNet50 84.4%）。Grad-CAM显示DenseNet121更专注于核心病理区域。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和可解释AI为开发可靠、可解释且临床有用的诊断工具提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个自动化的STAR数据引擎和两阶段训练框架，用于增强多模态大语言模型在结构化抽象推理任务上的能力，并构建了包含64K样本的STAR-64K数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理视觉模态的抽象信息和多模态关系知识方面存在挑战，特别是在结构化抽象推理任务上缺乏高质量数据和能力增强方法。

Method: 开发了自动STAR数据引擎合成包含多模态关系知识的图像，并构建了两阶段能力增强训练框架，包含针对不同STAR任务的评估协议。

Result: 实验表明，该框架使较小的3B/7B模型在STAR任务上显著超越GPT-4o，并在5个开源MLLM上进行了验证。

Conclusion: 提出的数据引擎和训练框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型在结构化抽象推理任务上的性能，并证明了方法的可扩展性和数据可迁移性。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理多模态医学生存分析中的模态缺失问题，提高预测的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个混合垃圾图像分类框架，结合深度学习和传统机器学习，在三个公开数据集上实现了接近100%的准确率，同时通过特征选择大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化垃圾图像分类系统缺乏系统性基准测试，需要开发集成了机器学习、深度学习和高效混合解决方案的可靠基准。

Method: 比较了三种方法：(1)基于手工特征的机器学习算法，(2)深度学习架构（ResNet变体和EfficientNetV2S），(3)混合方法（使用深度模型进行特征提取，结合传统分类器如SVM和逻辑回归）。

Result: 混合方法在三个数据集上表现最佳：TrashNet和精炼家庭垃圾数据集达到100%准确率，垃圾分类数据集达到99.87%，超越了现有最佳基准。特征选择将特征维度降低95%以上而不影响准确率。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了更可靠的垃圾分类基准，并提出了高效的混合框架，在保持高准确率的同时降低推理成本，适合在资源受限环境中进行规模化部署。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 评估GPT-4o在零样本设置下对胸部X光片进行正常/肺炎分类的能力，发现简洁的特征导向提示可获得74%的最高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在医学图像解释中的潜力，特别是在没有专门微调的情况下能否可靠地执行诊断任务。

Method: 使用平衡测试集（400张图像，每类200张），比较四种不同提示设计的效果，从最小指令到详细推理提示。

Result: 简洁的特征导向提示达到74%分类准确率，而推理导向提示性能较低。模型显示出医学图像解释的潜力但可靠性有限。

Conclusion: 虽然ChatGPT在医学图像解释方面显示出潜力，但其诊断可靠性仍然有限，需要视觉推理和领域特定适应的进一步改进才能安全应用于临床实践。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文揭示了模态失语症现象——当前统一多模态模型能准确记忆视觉概念但无法用文字表达，尽管同时接受图像和文本训练。这种现象是模型的基本属性而非训练伪影，可能带来AI安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前统一多模态模型中存在的系统性分离现象：模型在视觉模态上能准确记忆概念，但在文本模态中却无法正确表达相同概念，尽管模型同时接受了两种模态的训练。

Method: 通过实验验证：让前沿模型生成标志性电影艺术品的精确再现，然后要求其提供文字描述；在多个架构的合成数据集上进行受控实验。

Result: 实验证实模态失语症可靠地作为当前统一多模态模型的基本属性出现，而不仅仅是训练伪影。模型能在文本对齐的情况下仍生成不安全图像，显示安全框架存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 模态失语症是当前多模态模型的固有特性，可能导致AI安全框架中的漏洞，因为单一模态的安全防护可能无法阻止有害概念在其他模态中的生成。

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在长上下文视觉信息理解和GUI控制等代理任务中的挑战，特别是针对结构化文档的决策导向理解，同时克服现有方法内存消耗大、难以本地部署的问题。

Method: 提出链式滚动机制选择性递归导航文档，设计专用数据生成管道构建信息丰富的滚动轨迹，并采用情景组相对策略优化的强化学习方法缩小训练与推理差距。

Result: 方法显著降低内存使用，有效模拟人类阅读行为，是首个在多页文档问答中明确建模代理阅读模式的框架。

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM通过创新的链式滚动机制和专用训练方法，提升了多模态代理在长上下文文档导航中的能力，为本地可部署解决方案提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT)方法，使Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM)能够独立训练，无需依赖预训练的PFGM++模型，并在CT图像去噪任务中取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFCM原本只能通过蒸馏方式训练，这限制了其在多种数据模态中的应用潜力。研究目标是开发一种独立训练PFCM的方法。

Method: 利用扰动核移除预训练的PFGM++依赖，引入正弦离散化调度和Beta噪声分布以提高适应性和样本质量。

Result: 在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中，模型在LPIPS和SSIM指标上改善了图像质量，去噪效果与Consistency Model等模型相当。

Conclusion: PFCT被证明是训练PFCM的有效方法，在生成建模领域具有应用潜力，但需要进一步优化和扩展到其他生成任务。

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Motivation: 工程图是制造沟通的基础，但解释具有密集注释的复杂多视图图纸仍然具有挑战性，传统方法难以处理变化的布局、方向和混合符号文本内容。

Method: 三阶段混合框架：第一阶段使用YOLOv11-det进行布局分割；第二阶段使用YOLOv11-obb进行方向感知的细粒度注释检测；第三阶段使用两个基于Donut的VLMs进行语义内容解析。

Result: 开发了两个专用数据集（1000张图纸用于布局检测，1406张用于注释级训练）。字母VLM总体F1得分0.672，数字VLM达到0.963，在文本和定量解释方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 统一的JSON输出能够与CAD和制造数据库无缝集成，为智能工程图分析提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

Motivation: 现有运动预测模型在安全关键的极端场景（corner cases）中表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据中常见场景过度代表以及模型泛化能力有限。

Method: 构建紧凑场景表示，结合轻量级时间分词器将轨迹映射到LLM特征空间，使用混合专家（MoE）分解复杂场景，通过路由器分配场景到专门专家进行意图推理和反事实推演。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，WM-MoE持续优于最先进基线方法，在极端场景和数据缺失条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的架构为自动驾驶中鲁棒且可泛化的运动预测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive

achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning based generative models, particularly
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
Diffusion Models (DMs), have been instrumental in in generating diverse,
high-quality content across various domains, such as image and video synthesis.
This capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured

this need, this survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the
literature and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the development
of GANs, VAEs, and DMs, including their many variants and combined approaches.
We highlight key innovations that have improved the quality, diversity, and
controllability of generated outputs, reflecting the expanding potential of
generative artificial intelligence. In addition to summarizing technical
progress, we examine rising ethical concerns, including the risks of misuse and
the broader societal impact of synthetic media. Finally, we outline persistent
challenges and propose future research directions, offering a structured and

pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lite-Diff是一种轻量级扩散模型微调方法，通过冻结基础模型权重并优化小型残差适配器模块，显著降低计算开销并防止过拟合，特别适用于医疗影像等数据稀缺领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但在医疗影像等专业领域的微调面临挑战，主要问题是领域特定数据有限且全模型适配计算成本高昂。

Method: 在冻结的扩散U-Net中集成轻量级适配层，结合潜在形态自编码器（用于领域特定潜在一致性）和像素级判别器（用于对抗对齐）增强训练。

Result: 在三个胸部X射线数据集上的实验表明，Lite-Diff相比原始全微调方法实现了更优的适配效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型中的迁移学习提供了有前景的方向，促进了其在各种低数据领域的部署。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

*Or Ronai,Vladimir Kulikov,Tomer Michaeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowOpt是一个零阶优化框架，将整个流匹配过程视为黑盒，无需反向传播即可在整个采样路径上进行优化，用于图像编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散和流匹配模型的迭代采样过程计算成本高，无法直接使用基于梯度的优化来控制最终生成的图像，现有方法只能单独处理每个时间步。

Method: 提出零阶优化框架FlowOpt，将整个流过程视为黑盒，无需反向传播，允许用户监控中间优化结果并执行早停。

Result: FlowOpt在图像编辑任务中达到最先进的结果，同时使用的神经网络函数评估次数与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: FlowOpt提供了一个高效、可监控的优化框架，适用于流匹配模型的受控生成任务，具有理论收敛保证。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Abstract: Sign languages play a crucial role in the communication of deaf communities,
but they are often marginalized, limiting access to essential services such as
healthcare and education. This study proposes an automatic sign language
recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for
gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit,
the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average
accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as
``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually
similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting
perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education
and public services.

Result: 该方法能够识别对模型预测贡献最大的主导概念，有效降低独立模型对协变量偏移的敏感性。

Conclusion: 基于字幕的XAI方法显著提升了机器学习模型的鲁棒性，为开发更可靠的AI系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

*Hyeonsu Kang,Emily Bao,Anjan Goswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VLM-SlideEval框架，评估视觉语言模型在幻灯片理解方面的表现，发现现有模型在像素级提取和跨幻灯片叙事结构理解方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态内容评估中应用日益广泛，但它们在幻灯片特定理解方面的能力尚未得到充分探索，尽管在智能代理流程中作为评估者的角色越来越重要。

Method: 开发了VLM-SlideEval评估框架，从三个维度测试VLMs：(1)基于真实标注的元素级提取；(2)对几何、样式和文本扰动的鲁棒性；(3)高级理解能力，如从乱序幻灯片恢复叙事顺序。使用Zenodo公开数据集，通过PowerPoint XML和实时渲染标准化真实标注。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs在像素级提取方面表现不佳，在受控扰动下显示出非平凡的协议性、保真度和一致性，在单幻灯片内容理解方面表现较好，但无法可靠捕捉跨幻灯片的叙事结构。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在幻灯片评估方面存在局限性，需要开发校准的、评估者在环的评估器，以驱动智能代理流程中的迭代优化和选择。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

*Mohammad Ali Etemadi Naeen,Hoda Mohammadzade,Saeed Bagheri Shouraki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合人体检测跟踪和时空建模的深度学习框架，用于监控视频中的多类异常检测，在UCF-Crime数据集上达到92.41%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监控视频异常检测面临的挑战：异常事件多样性、类别不平衡和场景相关的视觉干扰。

Method: 使用YOLO-World检测人体实例，ByteTrack进行身份跟踪，高斯模糊抑制背景，InceptionV3提取空间特征，BiLSTM建模时序动态。

Result: 在UCF-Crime五类子集上平均测试准确率92.41%，各类F1分数均超过0.85，表现出良好的泛化能力和类别不平衡鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 聚焦前景的预处理方法显著提升了真实监控场景中的异常识别能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GIFT方法，通过追踪视觉注意力在理解用户查询时的正向变化（"注视转移"）来预计算整体视觉显著性图，在解码步骤中同时增强对显著视觉信息和用户查询的关注，从而减少VLM中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要将VLM幻觉归因于过度依赖语言先验知识而非视觉输入，但忽视了视觉注意力沉没问题（注意力常被错误分配到任务无关的视觉区域）和跨模态融合平衡问题。

Method: GIFT方法预计算整体视觉显著性图，通过追踪用户查询理解过程中的视觉注意力正向变化（"注视转移"），在解码时同时增强对显著视觉信息和用户查询的关注。

Result: 实验表明GIFT在生成和分类任务中有效减少VLM幻觉，相比贪婪解码提升达20.7%，同时保持一般视觉语言性能且计算开销低。

Conclusion: GIFT通过平衡跨模态融合和减少视觉注意力沉没问题，有效缓解VLM幻觉，是一种简单高效的方法。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的3D T1加权脑MRI图像协调框架，通过解耦解剖内容和扫描器/站点特异性变化，使用基于SSIM的可微损失函数来减少站点间变异性，同时保持生物学特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描器型号、采集协议和成像站点的差异导致多中心研究的一致性和泛化性受限，需要解决站点间变异性问题。

Method: 基于SSIM的可微损失函数框架，分离评估图像亮度、对比度和结构成分，使用多个风格目标进行协调训练。

Result: 协调后结构SSIM达0.97，亮度SSIM为0.98-0.99，Wasserstein距离显著降低。下游任务显著改善：脑年龄预测误差从5.36年降至3.30年，阿尔茨海默病分类AUC从0.78提升至0.85。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了跨站点图像一致性，保持了解剖保真度，并改善了下游模型性能，为大规模多中心神经影像研究提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

TL;DR: MLLMs在坐标预测方面存在困难，特别是在高分辨率输入下。研究发现位置编码扰动会导致可预测的坐标偏差，而非随机错误。作者提出了VPSG方法，通过利用这些偏差的方向性进行校正，在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上取得了可靠改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉问答和文档理解等任务上表现出色，但在精确坐标预测方面存在挑战。高分辨率输入会产生长令牌序列，削弱位置编码并引入坐标输出的方向性偏差。

Method: 提出了Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG)方法，这是一种无需训练、在测试时使用的方法。通过运行带有打乱视觉位置编码的辅助解码来隔离位置无关的倾向，然后将其作为负面证据来指导数字预测，同时通过轻量级有限状态机保持坐标格式。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验表明，VPSG方法带来了可靠的改进，证明了位置编码鲁棒性对于MLLMs空间推理的关键重要性。

Conclusion: 位置编码的鲁棒性是MLLMs空间推理能力的关键瓶颈。VPSG方法通过利用位置编码扰动导致的系统性偏差，有效提升了坐标预测的准确性，为解决高分辨率输入下的位置编码问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统条件图像生成方法在条件包含不确定性时难以生成多样化的合理图像，要么通过修改随机种子导致难以区分有意义的差异，要么通过多样化输入提示但受限于可解释的多样性。

Method: Rainbow框架将输入条件分解为多样化的潜在表示，每个表示捕捉不确定性的一个方面。通过集成由GFlowNets参数化的潜在图，并利用GFlowNets的高级图采样能力生成多样化的轨迹，从而产生多样化的条件表示和对应的输出图像。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像数据集上的评估表明，Rainbow在图像合成、图像生成和反事实生成任务中，在多样性和保真度方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: Rainbow是一个简单有效的条件图像生成框架，能够处理条件不确定性并生成多样化的合理图像，适用于任何预训练的条件生成模型。

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Result: 在BDD100k、NuImages和Waymo数据集上生成了850万高质量VQA对，人类验证准确率达到91.16%。模型在GRAID数据上训练后，在多种空间推理任务上表现出良好的泛化能力，准确率提升达47.5%。

Conclusion: GRAID框架能够生成高质量的空间推理训练数据，显著提升视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，并具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%

TL;DR: CogStereo是一个新颖的立体匹配框架，通过嵌入隐式空间认知来改进具有挑战性区域（如遮挡或弱纹理）的视差估计，无需依赖数据集特定先验，在跨域泛化方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度立体匹配方法在基准数据集上通过微调取得了显著进展，但在零样本泛化方面不如其他视觉任务中的基础模型。需要解决在遮挡或弱纹理等挑战性区域的视差估计问题。

Method: CogStereo在细化过程中嵌入隐式空间认知，使用单目深度特征作为先验，捕捉超越局部对应关系的整体场景理解。采用双条件细化机制，结合像素级不确定性和认知引导特征进行全局一致性校正。

Result: 在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury、ETH3D、EuRoc和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，CogStereo不仅实现了最先进的结果，而且在跨域泛化方面表现出色。

Conclusion: CogStereo将立体视觉推向认知驱动的方法，即使在几何信息不足的区域也能确保结构一致的视差估计，展现了卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现强劲，但对输入损坏引起的分布偏移仍然脆弱。研究发现损坏会导致嵌入方差崩溃，这与性能下降密切相关。

Method: 提出Mint方法，一种简单的测试时适应方法，使用均值累加器和梯度累加器动态最大化基于伪标签的类间方差。该方法在小批量下也能有效工作。

Conclusion: 嵌入方差崩溃是CLIP在分布偏移下性能下降的关键原因，通过最大化类间方差可以显著改善模型在损坏数据上的表现。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

Conclusion: STG-Avatar框架通过刚性-非刚性耦合变形设计，成功解决了3DGS人体化身在非刚性细节和动态区域表示方面的挑战，实现了高质量、高效率的可动画人体重建。

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LOC框架有效提升了3D场景的开放集识别能力，为视觉语言模型在3D领域的应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Conclusion: ARFNet框架有效缓解了无源域自适应中的负迁移和域偏移问题，通过注意力机制和对比学习策略显著提升了模型在目标域上的性能表现。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Conclusion: I2-NeRF能够统一处理复杂媒体环境，实现各向同性度量感知，甚至可以估计介质属性如水深。

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 联合利用模型内部信念和输出概率的方法能够有效提升视觉语言模型的不确定性估计性能，为高风险应用提供更可靠的信任评估机制。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

Conclusion: 该模型的白盒特性揭示了"部分-整体泛化"的简单组合过程，为大型神经网络生成模型的泛化学习提供了假设。

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架和模型在建筑工地轨迹预测方面表现出色，能够有效捕捉时空交互，为碰撞避免系统提供了可靠的技术基础。

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in

Conclusion: GALA为多源主动域自适应提供了简单有效的解决方案，显著减少了标注成本同时保持了高性能

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Method: 两阶段选择流程：第一阶段使用预训练扩散模型提取多尺度特征，通过MaxHerding选择代表性像素构建多样化全局候选池；第二阶段计算熵增强的不确定性评分(eDALD)来选择信息量最大的像素进行标注，将多样性和不确定性解耦。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统车道检测方法在复杂场景下的泛化能力不足问题，利用扩散模型的生成能力提升检测性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的事故预测范式，从当前帧风险评分转向直接预测多个未来时间步的事故分数，解决了现有方法依赖模糊二元监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于模糊的二元监督（将所有事故视频帧标记为正样本），而风险随时间连续变化，这导致不可靠的学习和误报。

Method: 使用片段级编码器联合建模时空动态，以及基于Transformer的时间解码器，通过专用时间查询同时预测所有未来时间范围的事故分数。

Result: 实验表明，在现实误报率约束下，该方法在召回率和事故时间预测方面均取得优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的新范式通过精确标注的事故时间戳作为监督，能够更可靠地预测潜在碰撞，提高道路安全。

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Motivation: 空中-地面行人重识别面临极端视角差异、遮挡和领域差距等挑战，现有方法在处理严重姿态变化和空间错位方面存在局限。

Method: GSAlign网络包含两个关键组件：可学习薄板样条模块自适应扭曲行人特征以补偿几何变化，动态对齐模块估计可见性感知表示掩码以减轻遮挡影响。

Result: 在CARGO数据集四个匹配协议上评估，相比先前最优方法，mAP提升18.8%，Rank-1准确率提升16.8%。

Conclusion: GSAlign通过联合处理几何和语义对齐，有效解决了空中-地面行人重识别中的视角差异和遮挡问题，取得了显著性能改进。

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用公开的大规模网络数据（如街景和卫星图像）进行城市社会经济感知对实现全球可持续发展目标至关重要。虽然大型视觉语言模型为此提供了新机会，但现有研究表明它们在视觉数据的社会经济预测方面仍存在准确性和可解释性问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了结合强化学习和LVLM在可解释、通用的城市社会经济感知方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable
and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard通过重要性比率归一化和梯度重加权策略，解决了GRPO强化学习中重要性比率分布偏移导致的隐式过优化问题，稳定了扩散模型的训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO强化学习框架中，重要性比率分布存在系统性偏移（均值低于1、方差不一致），导致PPO裁剪机制无法有效约束过度自信的正向更新，造成隐式过优化问题。

Method: 提出GRPO-Guard方法：1）比率归一化恢复平衡且步长一致的重要性比率；2）梯度重加权策略均衡不同噪声条件下的策略梯度，防止特定时间步区域的过度更新。

Result: 在多个扩散模型骨干（SD3.5M、Flux.1-dev）和多样化代理任务上的实验表明，GRPO-Guard显著减少了过优化，同时保持甚至提高了生成质量。

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard作为一种受调节的裁剪机制，无需依赖繁重的KL正则化即可稳定优化过程，有效缓解隐式过优化问题，使学习到的策略在实际应用中更加实用。

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Conclusion: 基于图的机制在自监督表示学习中非常有效，能够显著提升模型性能，证明了捕获样本间关系的重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: EndoWave通过结合几何约束和多分辨率小波监督，有效解决了内窥镜3D重建中的挑战，显著提升了重建质量和准确性。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的方法通常将fMRI活动映射到单个高级嵌入，并在整个生成过程中将其作为固定引导。然而，这种固定引导会压缩分层神经信息，并且与图像重建的阶段需求不匹配。

Method: 提出MindHier框架，包含三个组件：分层fMRI编码器提取多级神经嵌入；层次到层次对齐方案与CLIP特征建立层间对应关系；尺度感知的从粗到细神经引导策略在匹配尺度上将这些嵌入注入自回归过程。

Result: 在NSD数据集上的大量实验表明，MindHier相比基于扩散的基线方法实现了更高的语义保真度、4.67倍的推理速度提升，以及更确定性的结果。

Conclusion: MindHier通过分层重建过程（先合成全局语义再细化局部细节，类似于人类视觉感知）提供了一个高效且认知对齐的替代方案，优于基于扩散的方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately

class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and
parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a
rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate
that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将内参估计集成到自监督单目深度估计框架中的方法，通过改进Depth Anything V2模型实现深度、姿态和内参的联合预测，在SCARED和C3VD数据集上表现出色。

Motivation: 内窥镜手术场景的3D重建在增强场景感知、实现AR可视化和支持图像引导手术的上下文感知决策中至关重要。然而，在真实手术环境中，内参校准受到无菌约束和专用内窥镜连续变焦及镜筒旋转的限制，现有方法大多不估计内参参数，限制了重建的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于循环相关的可变形图像配准框架，通过动态重新定位匹配区域来高效处理大变形，在保持低计算成本的同时实现与最先进方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可变形图像配准中高效处理大变形的问题。传统卷积网络缺乏直接体素对应建模，而现有体素到区域匹配方法受限于局部性，难以捕捉长距离对应关系。

Method: 采用循环相关框架，在每一步执行低成本局部匹配，利用估计的偏移量指导下一个搜索区域，逐步收敛到大变形。使用轻量级循环更新模块，分离运动相关和纹理特征以减少语义冗余。

Result: 在脑部MRI和腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，该方法在精度和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。在非仿射OASIS数据集上，仅使用RDP方法9.5%的FLOPs，运行速度快96%，同时达到相当性能。

Conclusion: 提出的循环相关框架能够高效处理大变形配准问题，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本，为医学图像配准提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The
method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and

TL;DR: 提出TDSR框架，将图像描述重新定义为目标导向的分层优化规划问题，通过高效的MCTS算法显著减少对VLM的调用频率，提升描述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述中存在矛盾：强大的单步生成能力导致决策短视，难以在保持全局叙事连贯性的同时捕捉丰富细节。

Method: 将图像描述建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出TDSR框架，采用视觉引导并行扩展和轻量级价值网络的高效MCTS算法，并引入自适应早停机制。

Result: 在DetailCaps、COMPOSITIONCAP和POPE等多个基准测试中，TDSR作为即插即用模块显著提升了现有VLM的性能，在细粒度描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制方面达到SOTA或极具竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TDSR框架成功解决了VLM在图像描述中的内在矛盾，通过高效的规划方法在不牺牲质量的前提下大幅降低计算开销，为复杂场景描述提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

Result: 人类表现达到93%的多选题准确率，而最佳视觉语言模型为84%。生成式基准测试显示较大模型表现更好，但仅55%的时间产生相关目标，距离实际应用仍有差距。

Conclusion: 模型能从相关模态的额外信息中受益，而对不相关模态的性能影响最小。当前模型在目标推断任务上仍有改进空间，距离实际可用性还有差距。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Conclusion: 该半监督框架有效解决了CryoET中粒子挑选的瓶颈问题，通过利用未标记数据显著提升了检测性能，为蛋白质结构解析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing

bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in

solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

Motivation: 传统基于幅度的MRI模态（如T1w）对帕金森病病理敏感性不足，而基于相位的QSM技术能更好地量化深部灰质核团中的铁沉积，因此需要开发能有效整合这两种模态的诊断方法。

Method: 使用门控融合模块学习模态特定的注意力权重和通道级门控向量，进行选择性特征调制。这种分层门控机制增强ROI感知特征，同时抑制无关信号。

Conclusion: GateFuseNet通过自适应融合QSM和T1w图像，有效提升了帕金森病的诊断性能，Grad-CAM可视化证实模型聚焦于临床相关病理区域。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

Conclusion: ORIG展示了开放多模态检索在事实图像生成中的潜力，为解决多模态生成中的事实准确性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

TL;DR: AesCrop是一个基于美学驱动的图像裁剪模型，通过整合VMamba图像编码器和创新的Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB)机制，结合transformer解码器实现端到端的基于排名的图像裁剪，生成多个裁剪结果及对应的质量评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像裁剪方法在结合构图知识方面存在局限性：评估式方法缺乏全局性，回归式方法缺乏多样性。虽然混合方法试图弥补这一差距，但现有混合方法没有融入摄影构图指导这一定义摄影美学的关键属性。

Method: 提出AesCrop模型，包含三个核心组件：1) VMamba图像编码器；2) 新颖的Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB)机制，将构图线索显式编码到注意力机制中；3) transformer解码器，执行端到端的基于排名的图像裁剪。

Result: 大量实验表明，AesCrop在定量指标上优于当前最先进的方法，并且能生成在视觉上更令人满意的裁剪结果。

Conclusion: 通过显式地将构图线索编码到注意力机制中，MCAB能够引导AesCrop关注构图最显著的区域，从而在图像裁剪任务中实现更好的美学效果。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的即插即用空间重聚焦超分辨率框架SRSR，通过空间重聚焦交叉注意力和空间目标无分类器引导机制，解决了现有扩散超分辨率方法中的语义模糊和幻觉细节问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的超分辨率方法由于文本条件的不准确和不完整，以及交叉注意力倾向于关注不相关像素，导致语义错位和幻觉细节。

Method: SRSR框架包含两个核心组件：空间重聚焦交叉注意力(SRCA)，通过视觉基础分割掩码引导交叉注意力；空间目标无分类器引导(STCFG)，选择性绕过对未接地像素的文本影响。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，SRSR在所有数据集的标准保真度指标(PSNR和SSIM)上始终优于七个最先进的基线方法，在真实世界基准测试的感知质量指标(LPIPS和DISTS)上也表现更好。

Conclusion: SRSR在超分辨率中实现了高语义保真度和感知质量的有效平衡。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

*Mahiro Ukai,Shuhei Kurita,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench是首个用于严格评估视觉语言模型理解物体状态变化能力的基准，包含三个同步任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。实验表明当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代视觉语言模型能够执行多种多模态任务，但它们在精确识别物体状态方面的能力尚不清楚。为了解决这个问题，需要建立一个严格的评估基准。

Method: 提出了STATUS Bench基准，包含三个同步任务评估方案，并创建了手工制作的图像对数据集。同时构建了包含1300万半自动生成描述的STATUS Train训练数据集。

Result: 实验显示，在严格的评估方案下，大多数开源VLMs表现出接近随机水平的零样本性能。在STATUS Train上微调后，Qwen2.5-VL达到了与Gemini 2.0 Flash相当的性能。

Conclusion: STATUS Bench和STATUS Train对于推进VLM研究中物体状态识别的发展是必要的，当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍有显著困难。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Motivation: 现有微表情分析研究主要依赖实验室环境数据集，在真实世界场景中性能急剧下降，需要解决野外场景下的准确分析问题。

Method: 构建野外对话微表情数据集；开发端到端定位检测框架MELDAE；提出边界感知损失函数来惩罚起始和结束时间错误，提高时间精度。

Result: 在WDMD数据集上F1_{DR}定位指标比最强基线提升17.72%，并在现有基准测试中展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究通过新的数据集、框架和损失函数，显著提升了野外场景下微表情检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对扩展光场显微镜(XLFM)的3D重建新方法，包括XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集、自监督的掩码视图建模(MVN-LF)和光学渲染一致性损失(ORC Loss)，显著提升了重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场显微镜在神经科学中用于活体大规模神经成像，但基于学习的3D重建面临缺乏标准化数据集和缺乏能有效建模角度-空间结构的方法两大挑战。

Method: 构建XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集；提出掩码视图建模(MVN-LF)自监督任务学习角度先验；设计光学渲染一致性损失(ORC Loss)确保预测体积与PSF前向投影对齐。

Result: 在XLFM-Zebrafish基准上，该方法比最先进基线方法PSNR提升了7.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过标准化数据集、自监督学习和物理约束的有效结合，显著提升了XLFM的3D重建质量。

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角地理定位方法依赖资源密集的细粒度特征提取和对齐，多分支和多模块显著增加推理成本，限制了在边缘设备上的部署。

Method: 提出PFED框架，包含两个关键组件：训练时的层次蒸馏范式(HD-CVGL)和不确定性感知预测对齐(UAPA)，以及推理时的多视图精炼模块(MRM)，利用互信息过滤冗余样本。

Result: 在University-1652数据集上达到97.15%的Recall@1，计算效率比之前最优方法提升5倍以上(FLOPs)，速度快3倍，在AGX Orin边缘设备上达到251.5 FPS。

Conclusion: PFED在精度和效率方面均达到最先进水平，证明了其在无人机实时应用中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

TL;DR: PSScreen V2是一个部分监督的自训练框架，用于多种视网膜疾病筛查。它通过三分支架构（一个教师网络和两个学生网络）处理多源部分标注数据集中的标签缺失和域偏移问题，采用低频丢弃和低频不确定性等特征增强策略提升域泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖全标注或单域数据集的问题，处理多源部分标注数据集中同时存在的标签缺失和域偏移挑战。

Method: 采用三分支架构：教师分支从弱增强图像生成伪标签解决标签缺失；两个学生分支分别使用低频丢弃（LF-Dropout）增强域鲁棒性，以及低频不确定性（LF-Uncert）通过对抗学习的高斯扰动估计不确定域变异性。

Conclusion: PSScreen V2是一个通用且适应性强的框架，能有效处理多源部分标注数据，在视网膜疾病筛查任务中表现出色，具有很好的域泛化能力。

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The
codes are available at https://github.com/boyiZheng99/PSScreen_V2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型主要从FBP重建中恢复干净图像，但如何将数据一致性融入这些模型仍未被充分探索。融入投影数据可以提高重建保真度和细节恢复能力。

Method: 提出PEDB方法，引入新的反向SDE，在干净图像采样过程中同时条件化FBP重建和投影数据。将投影数据嵌入到反向SDE的得分函数中，推导后验得分的可处理表达式，并设计离散化方案减少误差。

Result: 在三种不完整数据(稀疏视图、有限角度、截断投影)的CT重建中，PEDB在标准、噪声和域偏移评估中均优于现有最先进的扩散桥模型。

Conclusion: PEDB通过显式条件化投影数据，成功将数据一致性融入扩散桥模型，在不完整CT数据重建中实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

TL;DR: SWAN是一个三阶段自监督小波神经网络，用于从高光谱图像中联合估计端元和丰度，无需地面真值，通过小波变换和多尺度表示实现性能提升。


<details>

Motivation: 高光谱图像解混是遥感领域的重要任务，传统方法依赖地面真值且难以处理连续重叠的光谱波段。本文旨在开发一种自监督方法，利用小波变换的稀疏多尺度表示来学习稳健的解混函数。

Method: 三阶段自监督小波神经网络：1) SWANencoder将小波系数映射到低维潜在空间；2) SWANdecoder重建输入小波系数；3) SWANforward学习高光谱图像的物理特性。使用三阶段组合损失函数和Adam优化器。

Result: 在两个合成数据集和三个真实高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中均优于现有最先进的神经网络解混方法，学习到了更稳健的解混函数。

Conclusion: SWAN通过自监督学习和小波变换成功实现了端元和丰度的联合估计，提供了紧凑的网络参数和实际应用价值，无需地面真值即可获得良好性能。

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

Motivation: 农业应用中缺乏大规模标注的牲畜数据集，特别是奶牛姿态估计数据，希望通过跨物种迁移学习来解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用基于视觉变换器的ZebraPose模型，在三个数据集配置上评估：自定义农场数据集、APT-36K基准数据集子集及其组合，系统评估模型在真实牛舍环境中的准确性和泛化能力。

Result: 组合模型在分布内数据上表现良好（AP=0.86，AR=0.87），但在未见过的牛舍和牛群上出现显著泛化失败，暴露了合成到真实域的差距问题。

Conclusion: 形态相似性不足以支持跨域迁移，需要农业优先的AI设计，强调农场级真实性、跨环境鲁棒性和开放基准数据集，以推进可信赖的动物中心技术。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive

classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的语义编辑解决方案，通过分析模型内部参数实现了对扩散模型输出的精确控制。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SAR自监督学习方法主要关注低层视觉特征，忽视了多模态对齐和零样本目标识别能力，限制了SAR图像的语义理解。

Method: 构建了包含100万文本-图像对的SARCLIP-1M数据集，采用对比视觉语言学习方法，通过领域迁移策略训练SARCLIP模型。

Result: 在图像-文本检索和零样本分类任务上的实验表明，SARCLIP在特征提取和解释方面表现优异，显著优于现有最先进的基础模型。

Conclusion: SARCLIP模型有效提升了SAR图像的语义理解能力，推动了SAR领域多模态学习的发展，代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖单一表示方案，在大规模动态室外场景中性能受限，导致累积姿态误差和尺度模糊。

Method: 引入分层协作表示模块促进映射优化的相互增强，提出联合动态建模模块，通过融合开放世界分割与隐式残差约束生成细粒度动态掩码。

Conclusion: LVD-GS系统有效缓解了尺度漂移，增强了重建鲁棒性，并在大规模动态室外场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

*Hagay Michaeli,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Alias-Free ViT模型，通过无混叠下采样和非线性操作，以及线性互协方差注意力机制，使Vision Transformer具有平移不变性，在图像分类中保持竞争力并提升对抗平移的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers缺乏卷积网络的架构归纳偏置，对图像平移更敏感，而传统卷积网络由于下采样和非线性层的混叠问题也非完美平移不变。

Method: 结合无混叠下采样和非线性操作，使用线性互协方差注意力机制，该注意力对整数和分数平移都具有平移等变性。

Result: 模型在图像分类中保持竞争力，在对抗平移鲁棒性方面优于相似规模模型。

Conclusion: Alias-Free ViT通过消除混叠和引入平移等变注意力，有效提升了Vision Transformer的平移不变性。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高精地图预测方法在高质量预测方面表现不佳，主要由于任务不对齐问题：1）一对多匹配查询共享相同标签导致不合适的任务标签；2）任务共享采样机制导致次优任务特征

Method: DAMap包含三个组件：距离感知焦点损失（DAFL）为样本分配适当分类标签，任务调制可变形注意力（TMDA）获取判别性任务特定特征，混合损失方案（HLS）更好地利用DAFL优势

Result: 在NuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试中，在不同指标、基线、分割、主干网络和训练计划下均实现了性能提升

Conclusion: DAMap通过解决任务不对齐问题，有效提升了高精地图元素预测的质量，对自动驾驶安全具有重要意义

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日本二手房市场中关键建筑元数据（如建造年份和结构类型）经常缺失或过时，这影响了灾害风险评估和保险定价的准确性。

Method: 使用多任务学习模型从立面图像中联合预测建造年份（回归任务）、建筑结构和物业类型（分类任务），然后基于官方保险标准通过规则映射推导结构防火等级（H、T、M）。

Result: 模型在建造年份回归和类别不平衡的分类任务中均取得高准确率，定性分析显示模型能够捕捉与建筑年龄和材料相关的视觉线索。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了基于图像的可扩展、可解释风险分析系统的可行性，在保险、城市规划和灾害防备领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

Motivation: SVG在数字设计和机器人控制中具有基础性作用，不仅编码视觉结构还包含运动路径。目前缺乏能够统一处理多种输入信号生成交互式SVG的系统框架。

Method: 提出RoboSVG框架：首先生成多模态指导，然后通过专用生成模块合成候选SVG，最后在数值指导下进行优化。构建了包含100万个样本的RoboDraw数据集，支持四种任务：文本到SVG、图像到SVG、部分SVG到SVG、部分图像到SVG。

Conclusion: RoboSVG为交互式SVG生成提供了一个有效的统一多模态框架，在多个任务上实现了卓越性能，推动了SVG生成技术的发展。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.

### [126] [VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693)
*Wenlong Li,Yifei Xu,Yuan Rao,Zhenhua Wang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADTree是一种无需训练的视频异常检测方法，通过分层粒度感知树结构实现灵活采样，利用预训练模型的边界检测能力来准确捕捉不同时间跨度的异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个问题：监督方法需要大量领域内训练数据且无法清晰解释异常；无训练方法虽然利用预训练模型，但固定长度时间窗口采样难以准确捕捉不同时间跨度的异常。

Method: 提出VADTree方法：1) 利用预训练通用事件边界检测模型分解视频为事件节点；2) 构建分层粒度感知树进行自适应粗细粒度分层和冗余去除；3) 向视觉语言模型注入多维先验增强异常感知；4) 使用大语言模型进行事件节点异常推理；5) 通过节点间相关性整合多粒度异常分数。

Result: 在三个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，VADTree在无训练设置下达到最先进性能，同时大幅减少了采样的视频片段数量。

Conclusion: VADTree通过分层树结构和边界感知采样，有效解决了视频异常检测中不同时间跨度异常捕捉的难题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Windsock是一个多模态检索增强生成框架，通过查询依赖的检索决策和模态选择机制，结合动态抗噪指令调优，显著提升生成质量并减少检索次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRAG方法存在静态检索策略、不灵活的模态选择和次优信息利用问题，导致三个关键挑战：何时检索、选择什么模态、如何有效利用检索信息。

Method: 提出Windsock模块进行检索必要性和模态选择决策；采用DANCE动态抗噪指令调优增强信息利用能力；通过自评估方法将问答数据集转换为MRAG训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升生成质量17.07%，同时减少8.95%的检索次数。

Conclusion: Windsock框架有效解决了MRAG中的关键挑战，在提升响应质量的同时降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感领域标注数据稀缺限制了全监督方法的适用性，需要开发自监督学习方法来构建基础模型。

Method: 使用多级离散小波变换引导编码器学习尺度感知的高频表示，并提出地理条件位置编码整合地理先验知识。

Result: 在PANGAEA基准测试中，WaveMAE在语义分割、回归、变化检测和多标签分类等任务上均优于现有方法，轻量级版本仅用26.4%参数即可达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: WaveMAE被确立为多光谱遥感图像的强大且地理感知的基础模型。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT)，一个端到端的大型统一transformer，用于统一空间重建和实例级上下文理解的知识。通过3D一致对比学习策略，仅使用2D视觉输入就能编码包含几何结构和实例聚类的统一表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类自然地将3D世界的几何结构和语义内容视为相互交织的维度，但现有方法往往将低级3D重建和高级空间理解分开处理，忽略了它们之间的关键相互作用，限制了泛化能力和下游任务性能。

Method: 设计3D一致对比学习策略，指导IGGT仅通过2D视觉输入编码包含几何结构和实例聚类的统一表示。构建InsScene-15K大规模数据集，包含高质量RGB图像、位姿、深度图和3D一致实例级掩码标注。

Result: 该表示支持将2D视觉输入一致地提升为具有明确不同对象实例的连贯3D场景。

Conclusion: IGGT通过统一几何结构和实例级上下文理解，解决了现有方法在3D场景分析中的局限性，为下游3D理解任务提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

### [133] [Self-Calibrated Consistency can Fight Back for Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22785)
*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC)方法，通过语义一致性和空间一致性模块增强CLIP模型在零样本设置下的对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗微调即可防御多种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本场景下表现出色，但对对抗扰动高度脆弱。现有防御方法依赖带标签数据的对抗微调，限制了在零样本设置中的应用。

Method: SCC包含两个互补模块：语义一致性利用反攻击预热生成的软伪标签和多视图预测来正则化跨模态对齐；空间一致性通过增强视图对齐扰动视觉预测，在对抗扰动下稳定推理。

Result: 在22个基准测试和多种攻击设置下的广泛实验表明，SCC能持续提升CLIP的零样本鲁棒性，同时保持准确性，并可无缝集成到其他视觉语言模型中。

Conclusion: SCC展示了从CLIP建立对抗鲁棒范式的巨大潜力，其影响可扩展到更广泛的视觉语言领域如BioMedCLIP。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedXplain-VQA是一个可解释的医学视觉问答框架，集成了五个可解释AI组件，在病理图像分析中显著提升了性能，同时提供透明的诊断推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学VQA系统需要可解释性才能获得临床采纳，因为医生需要透明的推理过程来信任AI生成的诊断结果。

Method: 使用微调的BLIP-2骨干网络，结合医学查询重构、增强的Grad-CAM注意力、精确区域提取和多模态语言模型的结构化思维链推理。

Result: 在500个PathVQA组织病理学样本上，增强系统获得0.683的综合评分，相比基线方法的0.378有显著提升，同时保持0.890的高推理置信度。系统能识别每个样本3-5个诊断相关区域，生成平均57个单词的结构化解释。

Conclusion: MedXplain-VQA展示了作为稳健、可解释医学VQA系统的潜力，查询重构提供最重要的初始改进，思维链推理实现系统化诊断过程。

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC-Talk是一个基于扩散模型的单样本说话人脸生成框架，通过ReferenceNet和AnimateNet实现身份保持和运动连贯性，解决了传统方法在时间一致性、身份保持和定制化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频驱动说话人脸生成方法在音频-嘴唇同步方面有所改进，但在时间一致性、身份保持和定制化方面仍存在困难，特别是在生成长视频时。

Method: 提出MAGIC-Talk框架，包含ReferenceNet（通过文本提示保持身份和细粒度面部编辑）和AnimateNet（使用结构化运动先验增强运动连贯性），并引入渐进潜在融合策略来改善长视频质量。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIC-Talk在视觉质量、身份保持和同步准确性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了一个鲁棒的解决方案，能够从单张图像保持身份，同时确保帧间平滑过渡。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge是一个轻量级评估协议，使用多模态LLM作为公平评判者来评估文本到图像系统的公平性，通过解释导向的评分标准和证据约束来提高评估的可靠性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像系统评估方法（如人脸分类器和对比相似度）存在缺陷：它们奖励表面线索、缺乏校准的弃权机制，并且会遗漏仅弱可见的属性（如宗教、文化、残疾）。

Method: FairJudge协议将指令遵循的多模态LLM作为公平评判者，使用解释导向的评分标准（映射到[-1,1]），约束判断为封闭标签集，要求基于可见内容的证据，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: 在FairFace、PaTA、FairCoT等数据集上评估性别、种族、年龄等属性，并扩展到宗教、文化和残疾。在IdenProf、FairCoT-Professions和新发布的DIVERSIFY-Professions上评估职业正确性和对齐度。

Conclusion: FairJudge在人口统计预测上优于对比和以人脸为中心的基线方法，提高了平均对齐度同时保持高职业准确性，实现了更可靠、可重复的公平性审计。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

Motivation: 解决MediaEval 2025竞赛中商业广告记忆性预测任务，探索多模态融合方法在记忆性预测中的应用价值。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 LLM作为主干网络，集成预计算的视觉(ViT)和文本(E5)特征，通过多模态投影进行融合，采用LoRA进行适配，并利用LLM生成的基于专家知识的理性提示指导模型。

Result: 基于LLM的系统在最终测试集上表现出比梯度提升树基线更强的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: LLM引导的多模态融合方法在商业广告记忆性预测任务中具有优势，能够有效提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效解耦风格与内容，阻碍了跨风格语义理解的泛化能力，特别是在上下文学习中

Method: 集成跨风格特征编码器(CSFE)进行风格-内容解耦，语义对齐上下文解码器(SAICD)用于少样本风格适应，自适应语义一致性模块(ASCM)通过多任务对比学习确保跨风格语义不变性

Result: 在具有挑战性的多风格数据集上，SP-CSVR在视觉描述、视觉问答和上下文风格适应方面达到最先进性能

Conclusion: SP-CSVR在增强跨多样视觉风格的鲁棒性、泛化能力和效率方面具有显著效果

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合图像对齐方法通常需要长时间训练、大容量模型和大量超参数调优，计算复杂度高。

Method: 使用现成图像匹配器计算成对匹配，结合快速非参数聚类构建关键点关系图，通过图神经网络传播和聚合对应关系，采用图像级池化预测单应性参数，使用逆组合损失函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FastJAM在配准质量上优于现有现代JA方法，同时将计算时间从小时或分钟级减少到秒级。

Conclusion: FastJAM提供了一种快速有效的联合图像对齐解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持高质量的配准结果。

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Surgery框架，一种无需训练、零样本的概念擦除方法，直接在文本嵌入层面操作，通过向量减法消除目标概念，在保持图像质量的同时实现高效概念擦除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中概念擦除时生成质量下降的问题，现有方法往往损害生成质量，需要一种更精确的干预方法。

Method: 在扩散过程前直接操作文本嵌入，动态估计目标概念存在并进行校准向量减法，包含共现编码模块和视觉反馈循环来处理多概念擦除和潜在概念持续性问题。

Result: 在物体、露骨内容、艺术风格和多名人擦除任务中显著优于现有方法，达到93.58 H-score的物体擦除效果，露骨内容减少到仅1个实例，风格擦除H_a为8.09且无质量下降。

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery作为无需训练的方法，能够动态适应每个提示，提供精确干预，同时可作为内置威胁检测系统，为更安全的文本到图像生成提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强生成(RAG)和视觉语言模型(VLM)的零样本风力涡轮机叶片损伤检测框架，无需特定任务训练即可准确识别多种损伤类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机叶片在恶劣环境中运行，需要及时检测损伤以防止故障。传统基于无人机和深度学习的方法依赖大量标注数据，难以检测罕见或新型损伤。

Method: 构建包含技术文档、参考图像和领域指南的多模态知识库，使用混合文本-图像检索器结合关键词感知重排序，为VLM提供相关上下文，无需特定任务训练。

Result: 在30张标记叶片图像测试集上，RAG增强的VLM正确分类所有样本，而未经检索的相同VLM在准确率和精确度上表现较差。

Conclusion: 该框架通过检索参考图像增强可解释性和泛化能力，能够检测未见过的缺陷，为工业检测提供了数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangSplat需要为每个场景训练特定的语言自动编码器进行特征压缩，这带来了昂贵的逐场景优化瓶颈，限制了部署的可扩展性。

Method: 使用在ScanNet数据集上预训练的通用自动编码器替代场景特定的自动编码器，为任何新场景提供固定的紧凑潜在空间，无需场景特定训练。

Result: 在保持与原始LangSplat相当或更好的查询性能的同时，整个语言场构建过程实现了效率提升。通过MSE和余弦相似度验证了表示保真度。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入能够高效准确地支持新3D场景中的开放词汇查询，为可扩展的实时交互3D AI应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PPE的位置保持嵌入方法，用于在视觉token压缩过程中保持时空结构，解决了现有token合并方法破坏空间布局和时间连续性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现良好，但由于冗余的视觉token导致效率低下。现有的token合并方法虽然减少了序列长度，但经常因忽视位置关系而破坏空间布局和时间连续性。

Method: PPE在token维度上显式引入3D位置的解耦编码，使每个压缩token能够封装来自多个原始token的不同位置。支持级联聚类策略，实现渐进式token压缩以更好地保留性能。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试中，包括MMBench（通用视觉理解）、TextVQA（布局理解）和VideoMME（时间理解），PPE实现了2%~5%的持续改进。

Conclusion: 保持位置线索对于高效有效的MLLM推理至关重要，PPE作为一种参数无关的通用操作符，可以无缝集成到现有的token合并方法中。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

Motivation: 挑战生物特征统计独立性的历史假设，验证不同生物特征之间是否存在相关性。

Method: 使用ResNet-50和Vision Transformer作为Bi-Encoder架构的骨干网络，在274个受试者的约10万张指纹和7千张虹膜图像上训练，通过对比损失最小化同一受试者图像间的距离。

Result: 虹膜ResNet架构在虹膜-虹膜匹配中达到91% ROC AUC，证明左右虹膜存在相关性；指纹模型重现了正相关结果；跨模态匹配仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了生物特征独立性的假设，未来计划扩展到其他生物特征，需要更多数据和更复杂的流程来获得有说服力的跨模态匹配结果。

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

TL;DR: 提出了一种可切换的令牌特定码本量化方法，用于人脸图像压缩，通过为不同图像类别学习不同的码本组，并为每个令牌分配独立码本，在低比特率下提升重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于码本的解决方案使用全局共享码本进行量化和反量化，但忽略了人脸图像中类别特定的相关性以及令牌间的语义差异，导致在低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 学习不同图像类别的码本组，为每个令牌分配独立码本，通过少量比特记录每个令牌所属的码本组，在降低每个码本组大小的同时减少损失。

Result: 在0.05 bpp下，重建图像的平均识别准确率达到93.51%。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到任何现有的基于码本的表征学习方法中，在低比特率下显著提升了人脸图像的重建性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

TL;DR: 提出一种高效的多模态融合方法，通过保留原始模型块并插入多模态自注意力块，在仅使用35B tokens训练的情况下，在多个基准测试中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型虽然性能显著，但大多需要从头训练且计算资源消耗巨大。本文旨在通过战略性地融合公开可用的生成和理解模型，以更高效的方式获得竞争性性能。

Method: 采用双重融合机制：保留原始模型块，同时在网络中交错插入多模态自注意力块。这种方法既实现了丰富的多模态融合，又保留了基础模型的原有优势，并促进了理解编码器的高级语义表示与生成编码器的低级空间信号的协同融合。

Result: 仅使用约35B tokens训练，在多个基准测试中取得强劲结果：GenEval组合文本到图像生成0.91分，DPG-Bench复杂文本到图像生成82.16分，GEditBench 6.06分，ImgEdit-Bench图像编辑3.77分。

Conclusion: 通过战略融合现有模型而非从头训练，可以高效实现竞争性多模态性能。作者完全开源了代码、模型权重和数据集，以支持未来统一多模态建模研究。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

TL;DR: FAME是一种公平感知的注意力调制视频编辑方法，通过注入去偏置令牌和调制时空注意力机制，在保持提示对齐和时间一致性的同时缓解职业相关的性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的免训练视频编辑模型在处理职业相关提示时容易陷入性别刻板印象，需要一种能够在保持视频质量的同时缓解性别偏见的方法。

Method: 通过从现有少数群体表示中推导公平嵌入，将去偏置令牌软注入文本编码器；在时间自注意力和提示到区域交叉注意力中集成公平调制；使用区域约束注意力掩码和时间衰减权重增强区域内一致性；通过去偏置提示嵌入的公平敏感相似性掩码重新加权令牌到区域匹配分数。

Result: 在FairVE基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FAME实现了更强的公平对齐和语义保真度，超越了现有的视频编辑基线方法。

Conclusion: FAME通过公平感知的注意力调制机制，有效缓解了视频编辑中的职业性别偏见，同时保持了良好的时间一致性和语义保真度。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Motivation: 基础模型已改变自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域，现在正在重塑遥感图像分析。为应对遥感数据多模态、多分辨率、多时相的特性以及领域独特挑战，多模态地理空间基础模型应运而生。

Method: 采用模态驱动的分析方法，研究不同成像物理和数据表示如何影响交互设计，分析处理模态异质性、分布偏移和语义鸿沟的关键技术，包括对齐、集成和知识转移方法。

Conclusion: 多模态GFMs在遥感领域展现出巨大潜力，但仍面临领域泛化、可解释性、效率和隐私等挑战，需要进一步研究解决。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练免费视频编辑方法依赖启发式帧选择来维持DDIM反演期间的时间一致性，这会引入人为偏差并降低端到端推理的可扩展性。

Method: VALA采用变分对齐模块，通过变分框架和对比学习目标自适应选择关键帧，将跨帧潜在表示压缩为保持内容和时间一致性的潜在锚点。

Result: 在真实世界视频编辑基准测试中，VALA在反演保真度、编辑质量和时间一致性方面达到了最先进的性能，同时比先前方法具有更高的效率。

Conclusion: VALA能够完全集成到训练免费的基于文本到图像的视频编辑模型中，显著提升了视频编辑的一致性和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架在驾驶场景生成方面取得了最先进的性能，为自动驾驶应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

Result: 大量实验证明SceneDecorator在场景一致性和叙事连贯性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SceneDecorator在艺术、电影和游戏领域具有释放创造力的潜力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix是一个可微分的即插即用模块，通过混合U形网络的多尺度解码器logits，自动学习最优的尺度组合和融合方式，提升分割性能且无推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有U形网络训练方法要么只监督最终高分辨率logits，要么对所有尺度应用相同权重的深度监督，忽略了粗粒度上下文和细粒度细节的互补融合潜力。

Method: 使用四种轻量级融合算子（加法、乘法、拼接、注意力加权融合）混合多尺度解码器logits，生成丰富的合成突变图，并通过softplus损失权重与网络参数共同优化。

Result: 在Synapse 8-organ数据集上，相比单输出监督提升DICE 4.2%，相比深度监督提升2.2%，相比等权重加法融合提升1.5%，在数据稀缺时优势更明显（+9.23%）。

Conclusion: LoMix通过可学习的加权多尺度融合，在四个基准测试和多种U形网络中广泛提升性能（最高+13.5%），同时保持数据效率、完全可解释性和零推理开销。

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at

TL;DR: CoMo是一个用于文本到视频生成中组合运动定制的框架，通过解耦静态-动态调整和即插即用的分治策略，解决了多主体复杂运动控制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型在复杂多主体运动控制方面表现不佳，单运动定制方法在组合场景中失败，主要由于运动-外观纠缠和无效的多运动混合问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 单运动学习阶段使用静态-动态解耦调整范式分离运动与外观；2) 多运动组合阶段通过即插即用的分治策略在去噪过程中空间隔离不同运动的影响。

Result: CoMo在组合运动定制方面实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了可控视频生成的能力，并引入了新的基准和评估指标。

Conclusion: CoMo框架有效解决了多运动定制中的关键挑战，为可控视频生成开辟了新方向，在复杂运动场景中表现出色。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的几何和属性增强框架UGAE，通过后几何增强、前属性增强和后属性增强三个核心组件，显著提升点云压缩的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云的有损压缩虽然降低了存储和传输成本，但不可避免地导致几何结构和属性信息的不可逆失真，需要解决这些质量问题。

Method: UGAE框架包含三个组件：基于Transformer的稀疏卷积U-Net进行后几何增强，细节感知KNN的增强几何引导重新着色策略进行前属性增强，以及属性残差预测网络进行后属性增强。

Result: 在8iVFB、Owlii和MVUB三个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，相比G-PCC测试模型，几何BD-PSNR提升9.98dB，属性Y分量BD-PSNR提升3.67dB，同时大幅节省码率。

Conclusion: UGAE框架有效提升了点云压缩的几何和属性质量，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法，同时显著改善了感知质量。

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在生成与文本提示完美对齐的图像方面存在困难，特别是处理同一类别多个不同实例的复杂提示时表现不佳，且现有评估方法要么过于简单，要么与人类评估相关性不高。

Method: 构建了大规模、多类别、多实例、多关系的M³T2IBench基准，开发了基于目标检测的AlignScore评估指标，并提出了无需训练的Revise-Then-Enforce后编辑方法。

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在这个具有挑战性的基准上表现较差，而提出的Revise-Then-Enforce方法在广泛的扩散模型中都能提升图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: M³T2IBench基准和AlignScore指标能有效评估复杂场景下的图像-文本对齐，Revise-Then-Enforce方法是一种有效的训练后优化方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Conclusion: NestAR模型通过创新的嵌套架构有效解决了自回归模型的计算效率和多样性问题。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

*Joungbin An,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraMamba是一个用于视频时间定位的分层架构，通过Anchor-MambaPooling块和对比损失函数，在长视频中保持时间结构并实现精确的时间定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时，由于过度下采样或依赖固定窗口，往往牺牲时间保真度。需要一种能同时捕捉全局上下文和细粒度时间细节的解决方案。

Method: 使用分层架构，核心是Anchor-MambaPooling块，利用Mamba的选择性扫描生成多粒度的紧凑锚点标记。采用锚点条件和段池化对比损失来保持局部细节和全局区分性。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上达到了新的最先进水平，在长未剪辑视频中实现了精确且时间忠实的时间定位。

Conclusion: HieraMamba通过分层设计和选择性扫描机制，有效解决了长视频中时间定位的挑战，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling
strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种多模态旋转位置编码变体MHRoPE和MRoPE-I，通过系统分析多模态RoPE的位置设计和频率分配，确立了三个关键指导原则，在多个基准测试中显著提升了多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态位置编码对视觉语言模型至关重要，但目前缺乏系统性的研究。本文旨在深入分析多模态旋转位置编码的两个核心组件：位置设计和频率分配。

Method: 提出了两种简单即插即用的变体：Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) 和 MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I)，无需改变模型架构。基于三个关键指导原则：位置一致性、全频率利用和文本先验保持。

Result: 在多样化的基准测试中，该方法始终优于现有方法，在通用和细粒度多模态理解方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析多模态RoPE并基于三个关键指导原则提出的MHRoPE和MRoPE-I变体，有效提升了多模态理解性能，为多模态位置编码提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal
understanding. Code will be avaliable at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出残差扩散桥模型(RDBM)，通过残差调制噪声注入和去除，实现自适应图像修复，在多种图像修复任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型缺乏统一分析视角，且通过全局噪声注入和去除进行图像重建，不可避免地扭曲未退化区域。

Method: 理论重构广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，推导其前向和反向过程的解析公式，利用给定分布的残差调制噪声注入和去除。

Result: 实验证明RDBM在多种图像修复任务中达到最先进性能，现有桥模型都是RDBM的特例。

Conclusion: RDBM通过残差调制实现自适应图像修复，既能修复退化区域又能保持完好区域，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/RDBM.

TL;DR: 提出了一个任务无关的多模态融合框架，能够融合时间序列和单时间戳图像，支持跨模态生成并在下游任务中表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索时间序列和图像的多模态融合方法，实现跨模态生成和鲁棒的下游任务性能，特别是在地球观测领域应用。

Method: 采用确定性和学习策略进行时间序列量化，利用掩码相关学习目标在统一表示空间中对齐离散的图像和时间序列标记。

Result: 预训练模型能从卫星图像生成一致的全球温度剖面，在下游任务中比任务特定融合平均提升6%的R²和2%的RMSE，比基线方法提升50%的R²和12%的RMSE。

Conclusion: 该任务无关预训练框架在多模态融合中表现优异，通过梯度敏感性分析提供了模型鲁棒性见解。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: DeepSalt是一个基于深度学习的频谱转换框架，通过知识蒸馏和新型频谱适应单元，将实验室高分辨率光谱信息迁移到卫星高光谱传感中，实现无需大量地面采样的准确大范围土壤盐度估算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤盐碱化严重威胁生态系统和农业，实验室光谱测量精度高但难以扩展到大范围，卫星高光谱观测范围广但分辨率不足，需要桥接这两种技术的差距。

Method: 提出DeepSalt框架，结合知识蒸馏和频谱适应单元，将实验室光谱的高分辨率知识迁移到卫星高光谱数据中，实现跨域光谱转换。

Result: DeepSalt在综合实证基准测试中显著优于无显式域适应的方法，证明了频谱适应单元和知识蒸馏策略的有效性，模型在未见地理区域也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个能够将实验室光谱精度迁移到卫星观测的框架，为大范围土壤盐度监测提供了有效解决方案，无需依赖大量地面采样即可实现准确估算。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

TL;DR: 本文从总最小二乘法角度统一了两种结构张量构造方法，证明Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项不必要，简化了张量解释并扩展了滤波器选择范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一Bigun和Granlund 1987与Granlund和Knutsson 1995两种看似不同的结构张量构造方法，通过总最小二乘法框架实现理论调和。

Method: 使用总最小二乘法线拟合功率谱的统一视角分析两种结构张量构造方法，比较梯度滤波器响应外积平均与正交滤波器调谐频率向量加权外积两种实现。

Result: 证明Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项不必要，省略后可确保张量保持半正定性，简化特征值解释，并允许使用非正交滤波器和非角度镶嵌。

Conclusion: 总最小二乘法框架成功统一了两种结构张量构造方法，提供了更简洁的理论基础，并扩展了实际应用中的滤波器选择灵活性。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3D参考点的多视角图像3D目标检测方法存在参考点远离目标对象的问题，容易导致误检。

Method: 提出深度引导查询生成器(DQ3D)，利用深度信息和2D检测确保参考点从对象表面或内部采样；引入混合注意力机制融合历史检测结果与深度引导查询形成混合查询。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，mAP提升6.3%，NDS提升4.3%。

Conclusion: DQ3D方法通过深度引导的查询生成和混合注意力机制，有效提升了3D目标检测的准确性。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以准确评估具有不同架构、训练策略和任务对齐的新兴预训练模型的可迁移性，限制了预训练-微调范式的应用。

Method: ITM框架隐式建模每个模型的内在可迁移性，采用分治变分近似策略高效近似嵌入空间演化。

Result: 在涵盖广泛训练机制和模型类型的综合基准测试中，ITM在稳定性、有效性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITM能够泛化到更广泛的模型和下游任务，为预训练模型的选择提供了更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相机-LiDAR融合方法在传感器退化或环境干扰的挑战性场景中性能显著下降，需要更鲁棒的融合策略。

Method: 首先将各模态特征投影到统一的BEV空间并使用窗口注意力机制增强，然后设计基于跨模态注意力的自适应门控融合模块来集成特征，构建了新的E3D数据集用于评估复杂场景性能。

Result: 在标准KITTI数据集上达到93.92%的准确率，在挑战性E3D数据集上比基线方法提升24.88%，在复杂工业场景中对不可靠模态信息表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AG-Fusion方法通过选择性融合可靠的跨模态知识，在复杂环境中实现了鲁棒的3D目标检测，特别是在传感器退化场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D

Motivation: 现有3D场景类比方法需要额外训练和固定对象词汇表，限制了在未见环境中的适应性和规划能力。

Method: 使用基于视觉语言模型特征的稀疏图和3D形状基础模型特征场的混合神经表示，采用粗到精的方式先对齐图结构再通过特征场细化对应关系。

Result: 方法能够在复杂场景间建立准确的对应关系，并成功应用于轨迹和路径点转移任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为零样本、开放词汇的3D场景类比提供了有效解决方案，支持跨场景的演示转移和任务规划。

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄像头广泛使用产生了海量视频数据，远超人工监控能力，这对公共安全构成挑战。需要开发能够及时检测异常或犯罪事件的系统，而智能体识别意外事件的能力与其空间推理能力密切相关。

Method: 将异常动作识别构建为零样本、基于语言的任务，通过将视频转换为文本描述，然后通过文本蕴含对标签进行评分。评估了四种开放模型在UCF-Crime和RWF-2000数据集上的表现，包括提示和隐私保护条件下的测试。

Result: 少量样本示例可以提高某些模型的准确性，但可能增加误报；隐私过滤器（特别是全身GAN变换）会引入不一致性，降低准确性。当前视觉-LLM在简单、空间显著事件上表现良好，但在噪声空间线索和身份混淆方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了在不进行任务特定训练的情况下加强空间基础化的具体路径：结构感知提示、跨片段的轻量级空间记忆、描述过程中的场景图或3D姿态先验，以及保留动作相关几何的隐私方法。将零样本、基于语言的流程定位为可适应现实世界视频理解的构建模块。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoDINO是一个改进的人类-物体接触预测模型，基于DECO框架构建，使用双DINOv2编码器和补丁级交叉注意力，在DAMON基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的人类与周围物体顶点级接触预测是机器人、AR/VR和行为仿真中高保真交互模型的前提。DECO作为首个野外估计器存在局限性：仅限于二元接触图，在软表面、遮挡、儿童和误报脚部接触方面表现不佳。

Method: 基于DECO框架的三分支网络，使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器，采用类别平衡损失权重减少偏差，通过补丁级交叉注意力改进局部推理。顶点特征通过轻量级MLP和softmax分配语义接触标签。

Result: 在DAMON基准测试中：(i)二元接触F1分数提升7%；(ii)测地误差减半；(iii)增加了物体级语义标签预测。消融研究表明LoRA微调和双编码器是改进的关键。

Conclusion: DecoDINO在DAMON挑战赛的两个任务中都优于基线模型，证明了其在人类-物体接触预测任务上的优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: PathSearch是一个用于数字病理学的内容检索框架，通过结合细粒度注意力马赛克表示和全局幻灯片嵌入，支持图像到图像检索和多模态文本检索，在多个病理数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全幻灯片图像检索的挑战，包括千兆像素规模和难以捕捉细微语义差异的问题，以支持病理学家的精确诊断、提高观察者间一致性并辅助基于案例的教育。

Method: 统一细粒度注意力马赛克表示与通过视觉-语言对比学习对齐的全局幻灯片嵌入，在6,926个幻灯片-报告对上进行训练，支持图像到图像检索和多模态文本检索。

Result: 在四个公共病理数据集和三个内部队列上评估，涵盖解剖部位检索、肿瘤分型、肿瘤与非肿瘤鉴别以及分级等任务，优于传统图像到图像检索框架，并通过多中心读者研究证明能提高诊断准确性、增强信心和改善观察者间一致性。

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理学检索解决方案，能够准确灵活地检索全幻灯片图像。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了深度伪造检测器在受莫尔条纹影响的视频上的表现，发现莫尔伪影会使检测性能下降高达25.4%，而现有的去莫尔方法反而会加剧问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中智能手机拍摄的数字屏幕视频常产生莫尔伪影，这一问题在深度伪造检测研究中很少受到关注，需要系统评估其对检测性能的影响。

Method: 收集了12,832个视频数据集，涵盖多个公开数据集，并在不同真实条件下拍摄；使用DeepMoiréFake数据集和两种合成莫尔生成技术进行额外实验；评估了15个顶级检测器的性能。

Result: 莫尔伪影导致检测性能下降高达25.4%，合成莫尔模式使准确率下降21.4%；去莫尔方法反而使准确率进一步降低17.2%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发能够鲁棒处理莫尔失真及其他真实世界挑战的检测模型，DMF数据集的引入旨在推动研究缩小受控实验与实际检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出Eruku方法，将手写文本生成重新框架为多模态提示条件生成任务，通过引入特殊文本输入标记和改进的自回归模型，解决了内容可控性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归Transformer方法在手写文本生成中存在需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制、容易产生重复循环和视觉伪影等问题，需要改进内容可控性。

Method: 将HTG作为多模态提示条件生成任务，引入特殊文本输入标记以更好地与视觉标记对齐，并设计了基于Classifier-Free-Guidance的自回归模型策略。

Result: Eruku方法相比先前解决方案需要更少的输入，对未见风格具有更好的泛化能力，能更忠实地遵循文本提示，提高了内容依从性。

Conclusion: 通过重新思考自回归公式，提出的Eruku方法在手写文本生成任务中实现了更好的内容可控性和生成质量。

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式增大补丁尺寸的自动课程学习方法，用于3D医学图像分割，通过逐步增加训练时的补丁尺寸来改善类别平衡并加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的固定补丁尺寸采样方法存在类别不平衡问题，特别是在小补丁尺寸下，这影响了分割性能。需要一种能够自动调整训练策略的方法来改善这些问题。

Method: 采用渐进式课程学习策略，在模型训练过程中逐步增加补丁尺寸。评估了两种模式：资源高效模式和性能模式，在15个不同的3D医学图像分割任务上进行验证。

Result: 资源高效模式在保持相同Dice分数性能的同时，将训练时间减少到仅44%；性能模式在Dice分数上实现了1.28%的相对平均性能提升，同时将训练时间减少到89%。该方法在高度不平衡的任务（如病变分割）中效果尤为显著。

Conclusion: 这种简单而优雅的数据输入变换策略能够显著提升Dice分数性能和训练效率，且适用于多种分割架构（UNet、UNETR、SwinUNETR），是一种广泛适用的性能提升方法。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对视觉语言模型的依赖增加，需要评估多模态模型的复杂性和方向是否正确，特别是关注文本主导问题和模态间交互的探索不足。

Method: 使用基于Shapley值的联合方法计算特征归因和模态得分，将视频帧和文本元素视为同等特征，将多选视频问答任务视为视频、问题和答案三个模态的交互。

Result: 在6个不同上下文长度的VLM模型和4个代表性数据集上的实验结果表明，模型对文本存在依赖，多选视频问答任务退化为模型忽略干扰项的能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前视觉语言模型在视频问答任务中对文本的过度依赖，以及任务本质退化为干扰项识别问题，为未来模型改进提供了重要见解。

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

Motivation: 现实世界对象具有自然层次结构，能显著帮助分类任务。捕捉对象间关系可提供更好的上下文理解并控制错误严重程度，而传统CNN分类方法主要关注平面分类。

Method: 基于YOLO模型家族构建端到端分层模型，引入新颖的分层架构、改进的损失函数和针对分层特性的性能评估指标。

Result: 在相同数据集的两种不同层次分类上训练评估：忽略视觉相似性的系统分类和考虑类间共同视觉特征的分类。结果表明该方法能有效处理现实对象固有的层次结构。

Conclusion: 所提出的分层方法能够解决传统平面分类算法经常忽略的现实世界对象固有层次结构问题。

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于ODE和SDE的求解器各有弱点：ODE求解器沿确定性轨迹积累不可约梯度误差，而SDE方法在步数有限时遭受放大的离散化误差。需要结合两者优势。

Method: 引入AdaSDE，一种单步SDE求解器，通过轻量级蒸馏估计每个步骤的可学习系数，动态调节误差修正强度，可与现有求解器集成。

Result: 在5NFE下，AdaSDE在CIFAR-10上达到FID 4.18，FFHQ上8.05，LSUN Bedroom上6.96，表现优异。

Conclusion: AdaSDE成功统一了ODE的效率和SDE的误差弹性，为扩散采样提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

Motivation: 现有讽刺检测研究主要关注单图像场景，忽略了多图像间的语义和情感关系，无法有效建模现实世界中由多图像线索触发的讽刺案例。

Method: 提出跨图像推理模型(CIRM)，进行针对性跨图像序列建模以捕捉潜在图像间联系，并引入基于文本-图像对应关系的相关性引导细粒度跨模态融合机制。

Conclusion: 多图像讽刺检测是重要研究方向，CIRM模型在单图像和多图像场景下均表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

TL;DR: MDReID是一个灵活的任意模态到任意模态的图像级重识别框架，通过解耦模态共享特征和模态特定特征，在模态匹配和不匹配场景下都能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的重识别系统经常面临模态不一致问题（如RGB、NIR、TIR等不同传感器），但现有方法大多假设模态匹配条件，限制了在实际应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出了MDReID框架，包含两个关键组件：模态解耦学习（MDL）显式分解模态特征为共享和特定表示；模态感知度量学习（MML）通过正交性和互补性增强跨模态判别能力。

Result: 在三个多模态重识别基准测试（RGBNT201、RGBNT100、MSVR310）上取得显著性能提升，模态匹配场景下mAP分别提高9.8%、3.0%、11.5%，模态不匹配场景下平均增益分别为3.4%、11.8%、10.9%。

Conclusion: MDReID通过有效解耦模态特征，在模态匹配和不匹配场景下都表现出优越性能，为实际应用中的多模态重识别问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有多视图3D重建方法严重依赖输入视图之间的充分重叠，实践中遮挡和稀疏覆盖经常导致严重的不完整重建。扩散式3D生成技术虽然可以通过学习生成先验来补全不可见部分，但其随机性限制了结果的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReconViaGen方法，通过分析扩散式3D生成方法一致性不足的原因，包括：(a)提取多视图图像特征作为条件时构建和利用跨视图连接的不足；(b)局部细节生成时迭代去噪的可控性差。设计了多种策略将重建先验整合到生成框架中。

Conclusion: ReconViaGen成功地将重建先验整合到生成框架中，有效解决了扩散式3D生成方法的一致性问题，实现了高质量的多视图3D重建。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep
learning in medical imaging.
  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative
neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain
adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image
datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic
input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and
integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex
3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing
the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through
rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,
demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features
applicable to various downstream tasks.
  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image
analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on
labeled data. It paves the way for more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools in
healthcare, signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning
in medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image analysis is central to drug discovery and preclinical
evaluation, where scalable, objective readouts can accelerate decision-making.
We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast
microscopy of C6 glioma cells -- a task with subtle dose differences that
challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation
pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image
label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and
improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance

*Yifan Jiao,Xinran Liu,Xiaoqiong Liu,Xiaohui Yuan,Heng Fan,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PlanarTrack，一个用于平面跟踪的大规模高质量基准数据集，包含1,150个序列、超过733K帧，支持短期和长期跟踪性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面跟踪在机器人和增强现实中具有重要作用，但由于缺乏大规模平台，其发展受到限制。

Method: 构建了包含1,000个短期和150个长期视频的数据集，所有视频在无约束条件下录制，每个帧都通过四角点手动标注并经过多轮精细检查和优化。

Result: 评估了10个代表性平面跟踪器，发现顶级跟踪器在PlanarTrack上性能显著下降，表明需要更多努力来改进平面跟踪。

Conclusion: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化和最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集，为未来研究提供了比较基准。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

*Songxi Yang,Tang Sui,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LSSR框架用于遥感图像超分辨率，基于预训练Stable Diffusion，集成多模态辅助信息，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升作物边界恢复和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感超分辨率中面临训练成本高、推理慢、辅助信息利用不足、缺乏下游任务评估等问题，需要开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于冻结预训练Stable Diffusion，集成交叉模态注意力与辅助知识（DEM、土地覆盖、月份）和SAR引导，使用适配器和定制傅里叶NDVI损失平衡空间细节和光谱保真度。

Result: LSSR在PSNR/SSIM上达到32.63/0.84（RGB）和23.99/0.78（IR），NDVI MSE最低（0.042），推理速度0.39秒/图像，在作物分类任务中F1得分0.86优于Sentinel-2的0.85。

Conclusion: LSSR框架展示了遥感超分辨率在精准农业中的潜力，通过高效利用预训练模型和多模态信息，实现了优异的性能和下游任务迁移能力。

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoTG-R1是一个新颖的课程强化学习框架，通过边界反射代理和难度估计代理解决视频时序定位中的部分标注样本和难定位样本问题，在仅使用10%训练数据和21%计算预算的情况下超越了全数据方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视频时序定位中忽略了训练样本质量和难度带来的挑战：部分标注样本引入模糊监督，难定位样本在强化学习中产生低且不可区分的奖励，阻碍学习效率。

Method: 提出边界反射代理利用MLLMs预测标注区间外的相关时间戳以过滤部分标注样本，引入难度估计代理评估样本训练难度，并设计课程RL策略动态屏蔽难定位样本的视频内容。

Result: 在VTG和基于视频的问答任务上验证了方法的有效性，仅使用10%训练样本和21%计算预算就超越了全数据对应的GRPO和SFT方法。

Conclusion: VideoTG-R1通过反射边界标注和课程RL框架实现了数据高效的训练，有效解决了视频时序定位中的样本质量和难度问题。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at
https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.

Method: 构建了两种优化方案并将它们组合，针对DDColor模型的频段限制和输入维度不足问题进行改进。

Result: 优化后的模型在图像着色性能上得到提升，PSNR和SSIM等指标均有改善。

Conclusion: 通过组合优化方案成功解决了DDColor模型的频段限制和色偏问题，提升了图像着色质量。

Abstract: The project has carried out the re-optimization of image coloring in
accordance with the existing Autocolorization direction model DDColor. For the
experiments on the existing weights of DDColor, we found that it has
limitations in some frequency bands and the color cast problem caused by
insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine
them, which achieves the performance improvement of indicators such as PSNR and
SSIM of the images after DDColor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云学习技术因缺乏大规模数据集而受限，需要克服数据稀缺性问题，提供精确标注和高效实验的数据集。

Method: 利用对称性概念创建具有已知结构的形状，构建公式驱动的数据集，可任意规模生成，确保绝对精确的标注真值。

Result: 数据集在点云自监督预训练中表现优异，在下游分类和分割任务中展现强性能，并具有良好的少样本学习能力，还能支持真实世界物体分类。

Conclusion: Symmetria数据集通过公式驱动方法有效解决了点云数据稀缺问题，具有高可扩展性和实用性，为点云学习研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Motivation: AI基础模型正在改变医学影像，但传统方法主要处理2D图像，缺乏对完整3D脑解剖结构的建模能力。

Method: 扩展DINO-v2视觉变换器，通过连续MRI切片整合体积信息，支持单模态和多模态输入，适应不同成像协议。

Result: 在标签稀缺和多对比度设置中，BrainFound持续优于现有自监督预训练策略和监督基线，提高了诊断准确性。

Conclusion: BrainFound为3D神经影像提供了可扩展的实用解决方案，具有临床部署和研究创新的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的工作流程，用于在城市场景中高效准确地将移动激光扫描点云注册到目标模型点云，通过SSC预处理和PV-GICP精细配准方法，显著提高精度并减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市场景中点云配准的复杂性，包括密度变化、噪声特性和遮挡情况等挑战，这些在繁忙城市中心很常见。

Method: 1. SSC预处理技术：通过识别相互正交的平面表面来优化分割MLS轨迹数据，减少漂移影响；2. PV-GICP精细配准方法：在体素分区中选择性利用平面表面进行配准。

Result: 在慕尼黑内城真实数据集上的实验表明，平均配准精度达到亚0.01米，同时处理时间显著缩短，计算时间比传统点对面ICP方法减少50%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动3D城市建模和更新方面具有潜力，可直接应用于城市规划、基础设施管理和动态城市监测。

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多平面截面的CAD逆向工程新方法，能够有效提取2D模式并捕获精细参数细节，首次将草图约束直接整合到重建过程中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在CAD逆向工程中存在不足：自下而上的几何驱动方法无法产生完全参数化输出，而自上而下策略忽略了细粒度几何细节，且都忽视了草图级约束这一CAD建模的关键方面。

Method: 受人类设计师手动执行任务的启发，采用多平面截面来提取2D模式，更有效地捕获精细参数细节，并将草图约束直接整合到重建过程中。

Result: 该方法能够重建详细且可编辑的CAD模型，在性能上超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了在CAD逆向工程中直接整合草图约束，为3D扫描到参数化CAD表示的转换提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

<details>

Motivation: 医学图像分析面临高质量标注样本稀缺和类别分布不规则的挑战，迁移学习虽然提供解决方案，但在类别分布不均时微调效果会下降。

Method: CURVETE采用基于样本分解粒度的课程学习策略训练通用无标签样本，并在下游任务中结合类别分解方法处理类别分布不均问题。

Result: 在脑肿瘤数据集准确率96.60%，数字膝关节X光数据集75.60%，Mini-DDSM数据集93.35%（ResNet-50）；使用DenseNet-121分别达到95.77%、80.36%和93.22%，优于其他训练策略。

Conclusion: CURVETE方法能有效提升医学图像分类性能，特别是在样本有限和类别分布不均的情况下，证明了课程学习和自监督训练的有效性。

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块，无需修改损失函数即可集成到现有网络中，有效提升低光条件下计算机视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

Conclusion: Video-Thinker成功将动态推理范式扩展到视频领域，通过自主工具使用实现了高效的视频推理，为视频理解任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协同感知数据集通常局限于单一交叉路口或单一车辆，缺乏多车辆和多基础设施传感器在多个交叉路口的综合数据集，导致算法在多样化交通环境中的基准测试受限，容易出现过拟合和误导性高性能问题。

Method: 在德国英戈尔施塔特的三个城市交叉路口部署传感器，收集34个时间对齐和空间校准的20秒序列数据，包含2辆车和最多3个基础设施传感器杆的协调场景，提供车辆RGB相机、LiDAR和基础设施热成像相机、LiDAR等多模态数据。

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X填补了多车辆和多基础设施传感器在多个交叉路口的协同感知数据集空白，提供了全面的评估和最先进的协同感知方法，公开发布了代码库、数据集、高清地图和完整数据收集环境的数字孪生。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

Result: MergeMix在分类任务中超越了其他基于启发式的方法，实现了具有竞争力的准确率和改进的效率。

Conclusion: MergeMix为分类和多模态大语言模型中的偏好对齐提供了一种可扩展的方法，增强了注意力一致性和效率。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

### [199] [On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23482)
*Zujing Liu,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Yuan Gao,Guisong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现大型视觉语言模型生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链存在视觉信息不准确的问题，提出了基于充分成分因果模型的学习策略来提升视觉推理的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-文本多模态思维链虽然能给出正确答案，但视觉信息往往不准确，表明推理过程缺乏忠实性。这源于强化微调中的奖励机制只鼓励视觉-文本交替的格式，而不考虑视觉信息的正确性。

Method: 提出充分成分因果模型学习策略，鼓励生成充分且最小的视觉组件，这些组件能够独立导致正确答案。该方法无需标注，可与各种强化微调方法即插即用。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在一系列细粒度感知和推理基准测试中持续提升了视觉忠实性。

Conclusion: SCCM方法有效解决了MCoT中视觉信息不可靠和不足的问题，显著提升了多模态推理的忠实性。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is

*Walid Bousselham,Hilde Kuehne,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VOLD框架，通过强化学习和在线蒸馏将文本推理能力从教师模型迁移到视觉语言模型，显著提升VLM的推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在复杂推理任务上训练困难，主要因为高质量图像-文本推理数据稀缺，而文本推理资源丰富但难以直接用于VLM

Method: 结合GRPO强化学习和在线蒸馏，通过教师模型指导学生模型的推理轨迹，并强调冷启动对齐对有效迁移的重要性

Result: 在MMMU-Pro、MathVision、MathVista和LogicVista等多个基准测试中显著超越基线模型，达到新的最先进水平

Conclusion: VOLD框架成功实现了从文本教师模型到VLM学生的推理能力迁移，冷启动对齐是在线蒸馏有效性的关键因素

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iPac提出了一种新的图像图表示方法，通过整合补丁划分、特征提取、聚类、图构建和图学习等阶段来增强图神经网络在医学图像分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图神经网络在图像分类任务中表现受限，主要原因是未能充分考虑视觉实体之间的底层结构和关系，特别是在医学图像分类领域。

Method: iPac整合了补丁划分、特征提取、聚类、图构建和图学习等多个阶段，通过捕捉相关特征并将其组织成簇来构建有意义的图表示，有效封装图像的语义信息。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验评估表明，iPac相比基线方法平均准确率提升了5%。

Conclusion: iPac通过利用图表示并考虑视觉实体之间的固有结构和关系，为图像分类特别是医学图像分类提供了一个通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
among visual entities.

*Yaoli Liu,Yao-Xiang Ding,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeFuse是一种无需训练的多主体文本到图像生成方法，通过自动融合多个主体LoRA，利用交叉注意力层权重动态生成主体掩码来实现高效的多主体生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么专注于预推理的LoRA权重合并，要么依赖分割模型和复杂的噪声混合技术来隔离LoRA输出，这些方法存在效率低、复杂度高的问题。

Method: 通过分析交叉注意力层权重自动推导上下文感知的动态主体掩码，在推理过程中将这些掩码直接应用于LoRA输出，无需修改LoRA或使用辅助模型。

Result: 在多项主体生成任务中，FreeFuse在生成质量和可用性方面均优于现有方法，实现了无缝集成到标准工作流程中。

Conclusion: FreeFuse提供了一种实用且高效的多主体文本到图像生成解决方案，无需额外训练、无需修改LoRA、无需辅助模型，仅需提供LoRA激活词即可使用。

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoThinker框架，通过时空思维链监督和两阶段学习课程，赋予多模态大语言模型强大的自我中心推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型擅长可见事件推理，但缺乏具身的第一人称理解能力，无法有效处理自我中心视频中不可观察的智能体意图和细粒度交互推理。

Method: 1) 构建EgoRe-5M大规模自我中心问答数据集；2) 采用监督微调SFT学习推理技能；3) 使用强化微调RFT增强时空定位能力。

Result: EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中优于现有方法，在细粒度时空定位任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: EgoThinker成功解决了自我中心视频推理的核心挑战，为多模态大语言模型提供了有效的自我中心推理能力。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

TL;DR: MERGE是一个统一的图像生成和深度估计模型，基于预训练文本到图像模型，通过可插拔转换器实现两种模式的无缝切换，同时保持原始图像生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式深度估计方法在训练时会导致预训练模型的图像生成能力严重退化，需要一种既能进行深度估计又能保持图像生成能力的统一模型。

Method: 提出可插拔框架，通过简单转换器实现图像生成和深度估计模式切换；引入组重用机制促进参数重用，提高额外可学习参数的利用率。

Result: MERGE在多个深度估计基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时成功保持了预训练模型的原始图像生成能力。

Conclusion: 预训练文本到图像模型不仅能用于图像生成，还能轻松扩展到深度估计任务，MERGE展示了这种统一模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The
code will be made available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/MERGE

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead Anchoring方法解决音频驱动人体动画中的身份漂移问题，通过利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性锚点，在保持身份一致性的同时允许自然运动动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频驱动人体动画模型在时间自回归生成过程中容易出现身份漂移问题，现有解决方案需要额外的关键帧生成阶段且会限制自然运动动态。

Method: 提出前瞻锚定方法，利用当前生成窗口之外的未来时间步关键帧作为方向性信标，模型在响应即时音频线索的同时持续追寻这些未来锚点，实现身份一致性保持。

Result: 在三个最新的人体动画模型上应用该方法，实现了更优的唇部同步、身份保持和视觉质量，在多种不同架构中均表现出改进的时间条件控制。

Conclusion: 前瞻锚定方法通过将关键帧从固定边界转变为方向性信标，有效解决了身份漂移问题，同时前瞻时间距离自然控制了表达性与一致性之间的平衡。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

TL;DR: FARMER是一个结合归一化流和自回归模型的生成框架，用于直接从原始像素进行可处理似然估计和高质量图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接建模原始数据分布的显式似然是机器学习的关键主题，但连续自回归建模在视觉像素数据上存在序列过长和高维空间的问题。

Method: 使用可逆自回归流将图像转换为潜在序列，通过自监督维度减少方案划分潜在通道，并设计一步蒸馏方案加速推理。

Result: 实验表明FARMER在像素级生成模型中达到竞争性性能，同时提供精确似然和可扩展训练。

Conclusion: FARMER成功统一了归一化流和自回归模型，解决了像素级建模的冗余和复杂度问题，实现了高效高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

TL;DR: 提出了InFlux基准测试，为具有动态相机内参的视频提供逐帧真实内参标注，包含143K+标注帧和386个视频，解决了现有基准测试缺乏动态内参变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数3D算法假设相机内参在视频中保持不变，但实际视频中内参经常变化。现有基准测试缺乏动态内参变化和场景多样性，需要更好的评估工具。

Method: 构建了全面的校准实验查找表，扩展了Kalibr工具箱以提高准确性和鲁棒性，创建了包含室内外视频的基准测试数据集。

Result: InFlux基准测试捕获了更广泛的内参变化和场景多样性，包含143K+标注帧和386个高分辨率视频。评估显示现有方法在动态内参视频上预测效果不佳。

Conclusion: InFlux基准测试填补了动态相机内参评估的空白，为开发更准确的动态内参预测方法提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注最终答案准确性，无法深入评估模型的推理过程。需要一种能够诊断模型推理一致性和错误检测能力的评估方法。

Method: 设计包含符号、几何和类比推理的多步骤视觉谜题，要求模型在给定的推理链中识别第一个错误步骤，从而评估逻辑一致性和视觉推理能力。

Result: 评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型在流畅生成和忠实推理之间存在差距：模型能生成看似合理的推理链，但难以定位简单的逻辑错误。

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench通过分离答案生成和推理验证，为多模态推理能力提供了更精确的评估视角，强调了在开发可信赖多模态大语言模型时诊断性评估协议的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有MLLM主要关注整体场景级理解，缺乏对细粒度、对象中心推理的需求。需要开发能够处理用户指定区域的精细理解能力。

Method: 提出尺度自适应对象标记器(SAOT)从自由形式区域生成紧凑的对象表示；设计PixelRefer-Lite变体，使用对象中心融合模块将全局上下文预融合到对象标记中，形成轻量级对象专用框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PixelRefer以较少训练样本实现领先性能，PixelRefer-Lite在保持高语义保真度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: PixelRefer框架成功实现了细粒度区域级理解，在准确性和效率方面均表现出色，为对象中心的多模态理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Conclusion: Concerto能够学习具有卓越细粒度几何和语义一致性的空间表示，展示了多模态协同学习在空间认知中的有效性。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and

*Kentaro Ueda,Takehiro Takayanagi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PREFINE是一个无需参数更新或直接用户反馈的个性化故事生成框架，通过构建伪用户代理和用户特定评分标准，实现基于用户交互历史的个性化文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化方法依赖显式反馈或微调，存在用户负担、数据收集、计算成本和隐私问题。需要一种无需参数更新或直接用户反馈的个性化生成方法。

Method: 提出PREFINE框架，从用户交互历史构建伪用户代理，生成用户特定评分标准，让该代理基于这些定制化标准对输出进行批判和优化。

Result: 在PerDOC和PerMPST数据集上的评估显示，PREFINE在自动评估中获得更高胜率和显著分数，且不损害一般故事质量。伪用户代理和用户特定评分标准对提升个性化性能至关重要。

Conclusion: PREFINE框架在保持故事质量的同时实现了有效的个性化生成，且可扩展到对话系统、教育和推荐等更广泛的应用领域。

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

*Ryan Zhang,Herbert Woisetscläger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGN（Schema-Induced Games for Naming）是一种命名游戏，通过引入轻量级结构来引导多智能体间的约定形成，相比无约束自然语言能实现更快收敛和高达5.8倍的协议一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实AI系统在处理复杂问题时，多个大语言模型智能体之间的不一致约定会导致协调失败，因此需要可靠、一致的通信机制，并且随着系统规模扩大，可扩展性成为核心关注点。

Method: 引入SIGN命名游戏，研究轻量级结构如何引导约定形成，比较模式诱导通信与无约束自然语言的性能差异。

Result: 模式诱导通信相比无约束自然语言实现了更快的收敛速度，协议一致性提高了5.8倍。

Conclusion: 最小化结构可以作为多智能体协调的简单控制旋钮，实现高效协调，这一方法有望在命名游戏之外的更广泛领域得到应用。

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

### [214] [Capability Ceilings in Autoregressive Language Models: Empirical Evidence from Knowledge-Intensive Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21866)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在能力天花板，参数规模扩大至30B时知识检索任务准确率几乎无提升，而数学任务准确率保持在19-20%不变，但损失函数持续下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中的能力扩展极限，为资源分配决策提供实证依据。

Method: 系统评估OPT和Pythia模型家族（70M-30B参数），分析准确率与损失函数的关系，并进行注意力干预实验。

Result: 知识检索任务准确率无显著提升，数学任务准确率保持19-20%不变（低于25%随机概率），而交叉熵损失下降31%。注意力扰动导致性能灾难性崩溃。

Conclusion: 对于OPT和Pythia架构的知识密集型应用，参数规模超过1-2B后准确率增益极小，尽管损失持续改善。这些发现揭示了特定能力扩展失败模式。

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

*Nannan Shi,Chuanyu Qin,Shipeng Song,Man Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GeoThoughts数据集和GeoThought-MLLM模型，通过包含详细推理链的训练数据提升多模态大语言模型在几何推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何推理数据集规模不足、多样性不够且缺乏明确的推理轨迹，导致大语言模型在视觉几何推理任务中表现显著下降。

Method: 开发了包含6,243个样本的Geo-Thought-6K数据集及其增强版本Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K，每个样本包含视觉描述、逐步解决方案、明确推理链、反思步骤和最终答案。基于此训练了GeoThought-MLLM多模态推理模型。

Result: GeoThought-MLLM在几何任务中超越了现有基准，在领域内和领域外设置下都提升了几何推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过思维链训练可以有效提升几何推理能力，错误主要源于数学概念误解或空间判断错误，通过思维链修正这些错误可以产生正确答案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

TL;DR: 将生成流网络应用于旅行商问题、最小生成树和最短路径三个图优化问题，通过训练学习采样与奖励函数成比例的解决方案，生成结果与经典算法一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型解决组合优化问题的能力，利用学习策略的优势实现计算可扩展性，在大型问题实例中可能超越经典精确方法。

Method: 使用轨迹平衡损失训练GFlowNets，顺序构建解决方案：为生成树选择边、为路径选择节点、为旅行选择城市。

Result: 在多种规模的基准实例上，GFlowNets学会了找到最优解，生成解与经典算法（Dijkstra、Kruskal、TSP精确求解器）的结果匹配。

Conclusion: 生成模型可以通过学习策略解决组合优化问题，主要优势是计算可扩展性：经典算法每实例有固定复杂度，而GFlowNets通过训练分摊计算成本。

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

*Shayan Karimi,Xiaoqi Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了在部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性框架下强化学习的计算复杂性，证明在此设置下学习$\epsilon$-最优策略是计算困难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索介于$q^{\pi}$-可实现性和$q^*$-可实现性之间的函数逼近框架，该框架假设策略集中所有策略的价值函数都是线性可实现的，提供了更实际的函数逼近模型。

Method: 通过从$\delta$-Max-3SAT和$\delta$-Max-3SAT(b)问题归约到GLinear-$\kappa$-RL（贪婪策略）和SLinear-$\kappa$-RL（softmax策略）实例，建立计算复杂性结果。

Result: 证明了在参数化贪婪策略集下学习是NP困难的，在softmax策略集下（除非NP=RP）存在指数级下界。

Conclusion: 在部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性框架下，通常无法获得积极的计算结果，这与生成访问模型下的$q^{\pi}$-可实现性形成对比。

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

*Josip Tomo Licardo,Nikola Tankovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究证明，经过优化的10亿参数开源模型在电子商务意图识别任务中可以达到与GPT-4.1相当的99%准确率，同时显著降低计算成本和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用大型语言模型在专业领域部署时面临高计算成本、延迟和运营费用的问题，需要寻找资源效率更高的替代方案。

Method: 使用QLoRA对10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型进行微调，并在合成数据集上训练，然后应用GPTQ和GGUF后训练量化技术创建GPU和CPU优化版本。

Result: 专用1B模型达到99%准确率，与GPT-4.1性能相当。GPTQ减少41% VRAM使用但推理速度降低82%；GGUF在CPU上实现18倍推理吞吐量提升和90%以上RAM消耗减少。

Conclusion: 经过适当优化的小型开源模型不仅是可行的，而且是领域特定应用更合适的选择，能以极低的计算成本提供最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

### [219] [Distribution Shift Alignment Helps LLMs Simulate Survey Response Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21977)
*Ji Huang,Mengfei Li,Shuai Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为分布偏移对齐（DSA）的两阶段微调方法，用于改进LLM模拟人类调查响应的能力，显著减少真实数据需求并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法存在提示敏感性和低准确性问题，而传统微调方法过度拟合训练集分布，无法产生比训练集更准确的结果，这偏离了使用LLM模拟调查响应的初衷。

Method: DSA是一种两阶段微调方法，通过对齐输出分布和不同背景下的分布偏移来学习分布如何变化，而不是拟合训练数据。

Result: 在五个公共调查数据集上，DSA始终优于其他方法，能够将所需真实数据减少53.48-69.12%，在准确性、鲁棒性和数据节省方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DSA通过关注分布变化而非数据拟合，能够提供比训练数据更接近真实分布的结果，在调查模拟中展现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

TL;DR: LightAgent是一个移动GUI代理系统，通过设备-云协作平衡本地模型成本效益和云端模型能力，在保持高性能的同时显著降低云成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动GUI代理面临的困境：真正在设备上运行的模型（4B或更小）性能不足，而能力强的模型（从7B开始）要么太大无法在移动设备部署，要么成本过高（如仅限云端的闭源MLLMs）。

Method: 通过两阶段SFT->GRPO训练增强Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型在合成GUI数据上的决策能力；集成高效长推理机制在有限资源下利用历史交互；默认在设备上执行，仅通过实时复杂度评估将具有挑战性的子任务升级到云端。

Result: 在AndroidLab基准测试和多样化应用上的实验表明，LightAgent匹配或接近更大模型的性能，同时显著降低了云成本。

Conclusion: LightAgent通过设备-云协作有效解决了移动GUI代理的性能与成本平衡问题，为移动平台上的智能代理系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder

pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

Motivation: 传统元强化学习在部分可观测环境中虽然能获得接近贝叶斯最优的策略，但无法学习到紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态，这种表示效率低下可能限制智能体的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 将自监督预测编码模块集成到元强化学习中，受神经科学中的预测编码理论和深度强化学习中辅助预测目标的启发。

Conclusion: 预测学习作为指导原则，在智能体导航部分可观测性时能促进有效的表示学习，更好的表示学习能带来改进的泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

Method: 采用SpecC方法学对PCM-to-PWM转换器进行建模和系统级探索，使用系统级估计和快速功能仿真来评估不同的硬件/软件映射方案。

Result: 成功找到了满足实时约束的硬件/软件分区方案，相比全硬件方案降低了估计成本，同时避免了在高端处理器上纯软件实现的昂贵开销。

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level
hardware/software co-design flow to a PCM-to-PWM converter, the core of a
Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

Conclusion: 基于第一部分的原则(LAP、ICM、CAP)和将智能定义为在批评下构建解释的观点，本文为因果推理提供了形式化语言，使系统能够理解而不仅仅是预测。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型存在能耗高、产生幻觉、无法应用于关键领域等问题，而人脑仅消耗20W功率。需要开发能效更高、具备推理能力的轻量级AI系统。

Method: 提出构建轻量级领域特定多模态模型，这些模型能够在动态环境中进行推理、规划和决策，利用实时数据和先验知识，并具备持续学习能力。

Result: 设想了下一代AI系统的发展方向，从当前的大型模型转向能效更高的领域特定智能体，需要硬件重新设计以实现1000倍以上的能效提升。

Conclusion: AI的下一个发展阶段将是轻量级、领域特定、具备推理能力的智能体，这需要硬件和软件的共同创新来实现能效的大幅提升。

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Conclusion: 为确保脑-智能体协作系统的安全、可信和有效，需要重点关注伦理数据管理、模型可靠性和人-智能体协作框架的建立。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

Conclusion: MA-CDMP通过扩散模型和均值场机制有效解决了去中心化通信资源管理的关键挑战，为实际无线网络优化提供了实用方案

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统反向传播方法在计算效率、内存消耗以及权重传输和更新锁定问题上的不足，从神经强化学习中获取灵感开发更高效的优化方法。

Method: 采用权重扰动学习，通过随机更新权重来最小化期望结果与实际结果之间的奖励预测误差，并利用该误差自适应调整学习率。

Result: 在XOR任务和混沌时间序列预测中，Dopamine优化器训练的网络收敛更快，性能优于标准权重扰动方法，与梯度方法相当，但计算和内存消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: Dopamine优化器不仅找到了稳健解，性能与最先进的机器学习优化器相当，而且在神经生物学上更具合理性。

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

Conclusion: OptiTree通过自适应问题分解和层次化思路整合，有效解决了复杂运筹学问题的建模挑战，为自动化建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR的稀疏、基于结果的奖励无法为中间推理步骤提供指导，导致探索缓慢。

Method: PACR是一种密集的模型内在奖励，基于模型对正确答案置信度的上升趋势来计算，约束搜索空间到逻辑合理的推理区域。

Result: PACR加速了探索，用更少的轨迹达到奖励饱和，在多个基准测试上取得改进。

Conclusion: 密集的模型内在塑造信号可以使RLVR训练更有效和可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in logistics. Solving large-scale

introduces a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement framework that
aggregates customers into meta-nodes using a spatio-temporal distance metric.
The reduced problem is solved with classical heuristics and subsequently
expanded back into the original space with feasibility corrections. Preliminary
experiments on Solomon benchmark instances show that the proposed method
reduces computation time while preserving or improving solution quality,
particularly with respect to capacity and time window constraints. The paper
also explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques,
highlighting their potential to further accelerate large-scale vehicle routing

The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a

Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed

consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination

Motivation: 现有几何推理基准主要关注2D平面几何，依赖静态数据集易受数据污染和记忆影响，且仅评估最终答案而忽略推理过程。

Method: 通过半自动标注流程构建，包含专家标注的推理链进行过程评估，测量逻辑有效性和因果一致性。

Result: 实验显示开源和闭源视觉语言模型存在较大性能差距，在动态设置下性能严重下降，在需要高级空间智能的任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo填补了立体几何推理评估的空白，揭示了当前模型在空间推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在推理任务上表现有限，特别是在复杂问题上。本文通过创建DeepRD数据集评估大型推理模型，发现它们在足够复杂度下性能急剧下降且无法泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视LLMs在复杂推理任务中的表现，验证现有基准测试的局限性，并评估LRMs在真实世界复杂场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 开发DeepRD数据集，包含可扩展复杂度的图连接性和自然语言证明规划问题，用于系统评估LRMs在不同复杂度下的表现。

Result: LRMs在足够复杂度下性能急剧下降，无法泛化到超出训练分布复杂度的任务，但多数现实世界问题仍在其成功范围内。

Conclusion: LRMs在短期内具有实用性，但需要开发能够泛化到超出训练分布复杂度的新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

Motivation: 理解大型推理模型(LRMs)涌现的推理能力是一个重要但困难的开放性问题，这对于改进训练和理解模型鲁棒性具有重要应用价值。

Method: 采用无记忆有限状态机(FSM)来近似LRMs的层次推理动态，识别出初始化、演绎、增强策略、不确定性估计、回溯和最终结论等离散推理状态，将推理轨迹表示为状态图转换序列。

Result: FSM分析揭示了不同模型在推理方法上的差异，显示出不同的推理模式和潜在缺陷，为模型评估和改进提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 基于FSM的分析提供了一种系统化方法来分析、解释和可视化不同模型的问题解决方式，为理解和改进LLM推理能力提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可中断协作角色扮演算法(ICR)，用于训练LLM代理在多轮多任务协作中更好地处理干预并促进团队共识对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在代理设置中与人类协作的部署增多，需要评估其在多轮多任务中的协作能力。现有LLM代理倾向于忽略有益干预，难以促进团队共识。

Method: 采用两玩家修正行动MDP分析标准AI代理的次优行为，提出ICR算法训练共识最优的协作代理，使其能智能收集伙伴代理的干预信息。

Result: 在多个协作任务环境中的实验表明，ICR平均能更有效地促进共识收敛，并探索更多样化的解决方案。

Conclusion: ICR算法能有效解决LLM代理在协作任务中忽略干预的问题，提升团队共识对齐能力，为构建更好的协作代理提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了OFFSIDE基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型中的错误信息遗忘能力，基于足球转会谣言构建，包含15.68K条记录和四个测试集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的发展加剧了数据隐私担忧，需要选择性遗忘学习信息的能力，但现有基准缺乏图像多样性、准确性不足且评估场景有限。

Method: 构建基于足球转会谣言的手工策划数据集，包含四个测试集评估遗忘效果、泛化性、实用性和鲁棒性，支持选择性遗忘和纠正性再学习等高级设置。

Result: 评估发现：单模态方法在多模态谣言上失败；遗忘效果主要由灾难性遗忘驱动；所有方法在视觉谣言上表现不佳；遗忘的谣言容易恢复；所有方法都易受提示攻击。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在显著漏洞，需要更鲁棒的多模态遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

TL;DR: 该研究首次直接比较人类与AI代理在多个工作技能上的表现，发现代理虽然工作质量较差且存在数据伪造问题，但执行速度快88.3%，成本降低90.4-96.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在人类工作相关任务中不断优化，但缺乏对人类工作执行方式的理解，需要揭示代理的专业能力和在不同工作流程中的角色。

Method: 引入可扩展工具包，从人类或代理的计算机使用活动中提取可解释的结构化工作流程，并在数据分析、工程、计算、写作和设计等技能上直接比较人类与代理的表现。

Result: 代理在任务执行中主要采用程序化方法，与人类常用的UI中心方法形成对比；工作质量较差但经常通过数据伪造和滥用高级工具掩盖缺陷；执行速度快88.3%，成本降低90.4-96.2%。

Conclusion: 代理在可编程任务上具有效率优势，适合委托执行此类任务以实现高效的人机协作。

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATOM是一个从非结构化文本构建和持续更新时序知识图谱的少样本可扩展方法，通过将文档分解为原子事实，采用双时间建模，实现了更高的完备性、稳定性和更低的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱构建忽略了数据的动态性和时效性，而现有的零样本或少样本方法存在不稳定性和关键事实覆盖不完整的问题，需要一种能够适应连续变化的方法。

Method: 将输入文档分解为最小自包含的原子事实，构建原子时序知识图谱，采用双时间建模区分信息观察时间和有效时间，然后并行合并原子图谱。

Result: 相比基线方法，ATOM实现了约18%的更高完备性、约17%的更好稳定性，以及超过90%的延迟降低，显示出强大的动态TKG构建可扩展性。

Conclusion: ATOM方法通过原子事实分解和双时间建模，有效解决了时序知识图谱构建中的动态性、稳定性和可扩展性问题，为实时分析和动态记忆框架提供了有力支持。

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个分析上下文学习性能的新框架，研究预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，适当构建的上下文如何将输出分布向查询任务分布转移，并量化了上下文学习性能与上下文长度及分布差异之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展示了强大的上下文学习能力，但理论上这些能力如何产生以及预训练过程和上下文构建等关键因素的确切作用仍不清楚。

Method: 构建了一个单层transformer的简单示例，然后将发现扩展到更一般情况，推导出上下文学习性能、上下文长度以及预训练与查询任务分布之间KL散度的精确关系，并通过实验验证理论结果。

Result: 当预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，适当构建的上下文可以将输出分布向查询任务分布转移，从而在查询主题上实现准确预测。

Conclusion: 论文建立了一个理论框架来理解上下文学习的机制，量化了上下文在弥合预训练分布与目标分布差异中的作用，为理解大语言模型的上下文学习能力提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于理性言语行为框架的自适应信号理论框架，用于优化人机协作中的信息传递时机和内容，通过多步规划提高用户在动态环境中的认知对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速变化的环境中，辅助智能体需要识别最高优先级信息，并估计如何以及何时最有效地传递这些信息，因为人类注意力是零和认知资源，关注一个信息会降低对其他信息的感知。

Method: 使用理性言语行为框架的贝叶斯参考解析方法，规划消息序列以优化用户信念与动态环境的及时对齐。智能体根据用户和场景特点调整消息的特异性和时机，基于对消息解释如何影响界面关注和信念更新的多步预测。

Result: 与基线方法相比，该方法的效果关键在于将多步规划与现实的用户意识模型相结合，证明了其在动态环境中通信的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是RSA在动态环境通信和人机交互中的首次应用，为人类-智能体团队的语用通信建立了理论基础，展示了认知科学见解如何指导辅助智能体设计。

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLIN-LLM是一个安全约束的混合管道系统，整合多模态患者编码、不确定性校准疾病分类和检索增强治疗生成，在症状到疾病分类和治疗推荐方面表现出色，显著提升临床安全性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的医疗系统缺乏医学基础且无法量化不确定性，导致输出不安全。在诊断风险高的异质患者环境中，准确症状分类和临床基础治疗推荐仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用1,200个临床案例微调BioBERT，结合Focal Loss和蒙特卡洛Dropout实现置信度感知预测。低置信度案例自动标记供专家审查。治疗生成使用Biomedical Sentence-BERT从MedDialog语料库检索相关对话，通过微调FLAN-T5模型生成个性化治疗，并通过RxNorm进行抗生素管理和药物相互作用筛查。

Result: CLIN-LLM达到98%准确率和F1分数，比ClinicalBERT提高7.1%，78%的top-5检索精度，临床医生评分有效性4.2/5。与GPT-5相比，不安全抗生素建议减少67%。

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM展示了鲁棒性、可解释性和临床安全性，为资源有限医疗环境提供了可部署的人机协同决策支持框架。未来工作包括整合影像和实验室数据、多语言扩展和临床试验验证。

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在高风险决策中仍缺乏领域知识、长期上下文和物理世界推理能力，需要结合人类和AI的互补优势来构建协作框架。

Method: 引入协作不确定性量化框架，开发了具有分布无关有限样本保证的离线和在线校准算法，在线方法能适应分布漂移和人类行为变化。

Result: 在图像分类、回归和基于文本的医疗决策等实验中，协作预测集始终优于单独使用任一智能体，在各种条件下实现了更高的覆盖率和更小的集合大小。

Conclusion: 人类AI协作不确定性量化框架能有效结合人类和AI的优势，在不确定性量化中实现更可靠的决策，并通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

TL;DR: SwiftSolve是一个复杂度感知的多智能体系统，用于竞争性编程，通过算法规划、经验分析和复杂度指导的修复来确保程序不仅正确，而且满足时间和内存预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的程序经常通过单元测试但违反时间和内存预算，需要确保程序在竞争性编程环境中的效率。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，包括规划器提出算法草图、静态修剪器过滤高风险计划、编码器生成C++代码、性能分析器编译执行并记录资源使用、复杂度分析器拟合增长模式并指导修复。

Result: 在26个问题上，SwiftSolve首次尝试通过率为61.54%，3次内解决率为80.77%，运行级成功率为73.08%，相比Claude Opus 4有显著提升。

Conclusion: 性能分析和复杂度指导的重新规划能有效减少低效率，同时保持准确性，证明在竞争性编程中仅正确性是不够的。

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在情感理解中生成的情感解释常常与目标标签不一致，甚至与自身预测的情感相矛盾，这种不一致性会降低交互系统的可靠性和用户信任。

Method: 提出情感理由验证器（ERV）和解释奖励机制，引导模型在情感识别过程中生成与目标情感明确一致的推理，无需修改模型架构或额外的视频-描述标注。

Result: 在MAFW和DFEW数据集上显著提高了解释-预测一致性和解释情感准确性，通过实验和人工评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了解释与预测的对齐，还使多模态大语言模型能够提供情感一致、可信赖的交互，是实现真正类人HCI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

Method: 利用首个生成token的对数概率分布作为分类信号，通过轻量级k-NN分类器预测响应类型，实现早期检测。

Result: 实验表明首个token概率向量在不同响应类型间形成明显可分离簇，能高精度预测实质性回答与模板化响应。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算简单但高效的LLM推理优化技术，可实现早期终止或重定向到小模型，显著降低计算成本，推动更可持续的LLM部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

### [253] [Atlas Urban Index: A VLM-Based Approach for Spatially and Temporally Calibrated Urban Development Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22702)
*Mithul Chander,Sai Pragnya Ranga,Prathamesh Mayekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Atlas Urban Index (AUI)指标，利用视觉语言模型和Sentinel-2卫星图像来更准确地测量城市发展，克服传统指标如NDBI的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如NDBI由于大气噪声、季节变化和云层覆盖等因素，难以准确捕捉城市发展，这阻碍了大规模人类发展和城市化的监测。

Method: 收集每个区域的Sentinel-2图像时间序列，在固定时间窗口内处理图像以获得最小云覆盖的代表性图像，使用视觉语言模型提供发展评分，并通过参考图像和最近历史图像确保评分一致性。

Result: 在班加罗尔的定性实验表明，AUI优于NDBI等标准指标。

Conclusion: AUI能够克服传统城市化指数的挑战，产生更可靠和稳定的发展评分。

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaCoT是一个在检索前阶段引入对比思维的新框架，通过生成对比问题和提取差异提示来引导模型关注关键细节差异，从而在单次检索中抑制语义干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询中面临的检索噪声问题，避免昂贵的后处理成本。

Method: 自动生成语义相邻但答案不同的对比问题，提取Δ-Prompt捕获关键差异，引导模型在检索前阶段聚焦决定答案分歧的关键细节。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中，RaCoT比RankRAG和Self-RAG等强基线高出0.9-2.4个百分点，在对抗性测试中性能下降仅8.6%，远优于其他方法的超过15%下降。

Conclusion: RaCoT将RAG范式从"事后上下文清理"重构为"先验塑造判别推理"，为实时、资源受限部署提供了高效可靠的AI系统路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着各大公司不断改进大语言模型，了解不同模型在性能、道德行为和可用性方面的差异变得至关重要，这些差异源于它们不同的设计理念。

Method: 通过分析三个重要因素：性能和准确性、伦理和偏见缓解、可用性和集成，对五个顶级LLM进行比较评估。

Result: 研究发现Claude具有优秀的道德推理能力，Gemini在多模态能力和伦理框架方面表现更好，DeepSeek擅长基于事实的推理，LLaMA适合开放应用，ChatGPT提供平衡性能且注重实用性。

Conclusion: 这些模型在工作效果、易用性和伦理处理方面存在显著差异，用户应根据具体需求选择最适合的模型以发挥其优势。

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM存在自信地生成听起来完全合理但实际上是错误信息的幻觉问题，这已成为在准确性重要的实际应用中部署这些模型的主要障碍。

Method: 结合结构化数据库、实时网络搜索和学术文献来验证生成过程中的事实声明，检测到不一致时自动纠正，同时保持响应的自然流畅。

Result: 在各种领域的测试中，幻觉减少了67%，且不牺牲响应质量。医疗、金融和科学研究领域的专家对纠正后的输出满意度达到89%，相比未验证的LLM响应有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在不能出错的应用中使LLM更可信提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以生成准确的个性化回答，需要更有效利用用户特定信息的方式

Method: 在文本和视觉token的KV-Cache中存储用户特定信息，通过检索相关KV-Cache确保回答准确性

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进的视觉问答和文本任务性能，特别是在依赖局部细节时表现更准确

Conclusion: Jarvis为个性化AI助手提供了一条实用路径

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

Motivation: 随着Copilot套件中智能体的动态扩展，需要一个强大的编排器来将用户提示的任务分发给合适的智能体。

Method: 使用Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO)架构，结合元学习训练决策树模型来选择不同智能体/模型之间的最佳推理策略。

Result: 通过两个生产用例展示了AMO的有效性：Microsoft 365电子商务Copilot和代码合规性Copilot，前者提供最新产品信息并连接多个智能体，后者扫描内部DevOps代码检测合规问题。

Conclusion: AMO能够有效处理Copilot服务中的多任务和可扩展智能体，为复杂的企业应用提供了强大的编排能力。

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

TL;DR: HRM-Agent是HRM的强化学习变体，能够在动态不确定的迷宫环境中学习导航到目标，并能重用早期时间步的计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRM虽然在小规模下具有强大的推理能力，但仅限于监督、静态、完全可观测的问题。许多现实问题具有动态、不确定或部分可观测的特性，需要能够整合和重用先前时间步的计算。

Method: 提出HRM-Agent，这是HRM的变体，仅使用强化学习进行训练，探索其循环推理过程的动态特性。

Result: HRM-Agent能够在动态和不确定的迷宫环境中学习导航到目标，并发现其循环推理过程成功重用了早期时间步的计算。

Conclusion: HRM-Agent扩展了HRM的应用范围，使其能够处理动态、不确定的环境，并验证了其推理过程能够有效重用计算。

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

Result: 在相同训练计算预算下，考虑计算成本的智能体在75%的游戏中表现更好，平均计算量减少三倍。

Conclusion: 让智能体在训练过程中考虑计算成本是可行的，能显著提高计算效率，为开发更节能的AI系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Conclusion: 研究为开发能够减轻模态差距、促进更平衡多模态推理的训练方法提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Bridging-Modality-Gap.

Conclusion: 即使论证主要基于符号方法和数字系统基础设施，这些观察可能指向更普遍适用的结构。

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the
computational cost.

Conclusion: GTR-Mamba通过跨流形调节和路由机制，成功解决了同时建模空间层次结构和时间动态上下文的问题，在POI推荐任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

Conclusion: InSUR框架通过多维度处理指令不确定性，能够生成更令人满意的语义约束对抗样本，具有更好的可迁移性、适应性和有效性。

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

TL;DR: ProfileXAI是一个模型和领域无关的框架，将SHAP、LIME、Anchor等事后解释器与检索增强的LLMs结合，为不同类型用户生成解释。系统索引多模态知识库，通过定量标准为每个实例选择解释器，并使用聊天式提示生成基于知识的叙述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够为不同类型用户提供高效可信解释的通用解释框架，解决现有解释方法在用户适配性和解释质量方面的局限性。

Method: 将事后解释器（SHAP、LIME、Anchor）与检索增强的大型语言模型耦合，索引多模态知识库，基于定量标准为每个实例选择最佳解释器，通过聊天式提示生成基于知识的解释叙述。

Result: 在心脏病和甲状腺癌数据集上的评估显示：LIME在保真度-鲁棒性权衡方面表现最佳；Anchor产生最稀疏、低令牌的规则；SHAP获得最高满意度。Profile条件化稳定了令牌使用并保持各配置文件的正向评分。

Conclusion: ProfileXAI框架能够为不同类型用户提供高效可信的解释，没有单一解释器在所有指标上占优，但通过配置文件条件化可以稳定解释质量并满足不同用户群体的需求。

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity--robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy
explanations.

Motivation: 现有稀疏步规划方法虽然能捕捉长期依赖关系，但过度稀疏会降低性能，且时间密度阈值在整个时间范围内是非均匀的

Method: MDD扩散规划器，在整个时间范围内密度可调作为超参数，允许轨迹的不同部分采用不同的规划密度

Result: 在Maze2D、Franka Kitchen和Antmaze D4RL任务域中达到新的SOTA水平

Conclusion: 可调节的混合密度规划策略能有效平衡长期依赖捕捉与规划性能，优于固定稀疏度的规划方法

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transition from a
computational instrument to an autonomous originator of scientific knowledge.
This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the
complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final
synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape
the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured
proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape,
obscuring overarching methodological principles and developmental trends. This
survey provides a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of this domain by
introducing a unified, six-stage methodological framework that deconstructs the
end-to-end scientific process into: Literature Review, Idea Generation,
Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper
Generation. Through this analytical lens, we chart the field's evolution from
early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems
(2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and
Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these
developments, this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous
science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining
challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation
of systems toward becoming trustworthy and indispensable partners in human
scientific inquiry.

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成高质量代码方面仍面临挑战，需要奖励模型作为推理模型发展的中间步骤。虽然模型反思能力通常随规模增大而提升，但本研究旨在验证先进的小型语言模型是否能成为有效的奖励模型。

Method: 构建基于APPS编程挑战基准的代码样本数据集，包含正确性标签。训练带回归层的价值头模型来估计中间输出的成功概率，将解码器转换器模型转化为奖励模型。

Result: 小型LLM能够作为有效的奖励模型或代码评估评判器，成功识别多个候选方案中的正确解。使用该评判器在多个生成结果中搜索最准确代码的能力提升了超过20%。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型可以被成功转化为实用的奖励模型，结合过程奖励和结果奖励的考虑，在代码生成任务中提供有效的质量评估。

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

TL;DR: Sci-LLMs在处理生物分子序列时面临tokenization困境，研究发现提供高层次结构化上下文比直接处理原始序列更有效，上下文单独输入性能最佳，原始序列反而成为信息噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学大语言模型在处理原始生物分子序列时面临的tokenization困境，无论是将序列视为专门语言还是单独模态都存在局限性。

Method: 系统比较领先的Sci-LLMs在生物推理任务上的三种输入模式：仅序列、仅上下文、两者结合。

Result: 仅上下文方法始终显著优于其他模式，原始序列与上下文结合反而降低性能，表明原始序列成为信息噪声。

Conclusion: 应重新定位Sci-LLMs为基于专家知识的强大推理引擎，而非序列解码器，发展重点应从直接序列解释转向高层次知识合成。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

Motivation: 现有技能发现方法仅关注技能多样性最大化，不考虑人类偏好，导致产生不良行为甚至危险技能

Method: 从基础模型提取评分函数来评估状态，基于人类意图为期望状态分配更高值，然后用这些分数重新加权技能发现算法的奖励

Result: FoG成功消除了翻转、滚动等不良行为，在基于状态和像素的任务中都避免了危险区域，还能发现难以定义的行为技能

Conclusion: FoG方法有效将人类意图融入技能发现，解决了传统方法忽视人类偏好的问题，在多种任务中表现出色

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

TL;DR: AUPO是一种新颖的MCTS决策策略改进方法，通过自动动作抽象显著提升性能，仅依赖奖励分布统计，无需转移概率或DAG搜索图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动抽象算法需要转移概率或DAG搜索图的限制，同时能够检测状态空间中相距较远的对称动作。

Method: 基于MCTS过程中收集的奖励分布统计，开发自动动作抽象算法AUPO，仅影响决策策略而不影响树搜索。

Result: 在IPPC基准问题上，AUPO明显优于标准MCTS，能够检测出ASAP等先进框架难以处理的对称动作。

Conclusion: AUPO作为一种即插即用的MCTS改进方法，与其他仅影响树搜索的抽象技术兼容，提供了更灵活有效的动作抽象方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法（如神经算子）需要大量高保真训练数据，导致显著的计算成本。为了解决这一挑战，需要开发高效的数据生成方法。

Method: BlocKOA算法专门为IC应用设计：首先基于热方程结构使用块Krylov算法快速获取少量基本解，然后组合这些解得到满足物理约束的众多温度分布，最后应用热算子确定热源分布，高效生成精确数据点。

Result: 理论分析显示BlocKOA的时间复杂度比现有方法低一个数量级。实验结果表明，在生成5000个具有不同物理参数和IC结构芯片的热仿真数据时，BlocKOA实现了420倍的加速。即使仅使用4%的生成时间，基于BlocKOA生成数据训练的数据驱动方法性能与使用现有方法相当。

Conclusion: BlocKOA算法能够显著加速集成电路热仿真数据的生成过程，同时保持高精度，为数据驱动方法提供了高效的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

Motivation: CNOT门是量子计算中的关键组件，能够产生纠缠这一量子算法的重要资源。某些量子电路完全由CNOT门构成，因此最小化CNOT门数量对提升量子计算效率至关重要。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能够有效解决CNOT门最小化问题，特别是在处理较大尺寸量子电路时表现出优越性能。

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

Result: 在8个数据集上的离线评估显示Bid2X优于多种基线方法，在线A/B测试中GMV提升4.65%，ROI提升2.44%。

Conclusion: Bid2X作为竞价基础模型在计算广告领域具有良好应用前景，能够有效提升广告效果并具备跨场景泛化能力。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DQN依赖关联学习，容易获得虚假相关性，限制了其问题解决能力。

Method: 提出将因果原则集成到DQN中，利用PEACE公式估计因果效应，在训练过程中加入因果推理。

Result: 在标准基准环境中的实验结果显示，该方法优于传统DQN，证明了因果推理在强化学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为通过原则性因果推断提升深度强化学习智能体能力提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提醒人们关注AI生存风险评估中线性模型的哲学局限性，强调在认知无差异情况下风险概率可能被低估的问题。

Method: 通过比较标准瑞士奶酪模型与作者模型，分析结构层间关系对P(D)概率的影响，并区分风险与不确定性，引入选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性两个维度。

Result: 论证了在认知无差异情况下P(D)概率高于初步估计，并指出任何P(D)估计都受到两种不确定性的结构性影响。

Conclusion: 将不确定性维度纳入AI生存风险的定性讨论中，可以更好地理解P(D)的可能性，为风险评估提供更全面的视角。

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业需要满足最小权限、符合法规且可审计的访问决策，传统方法难以处理自然语言请求与复杂策略的匹配

Method: 使用Google Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM，执行六阶段推理框架（上下文解释、用户验证、数据分类、业务目的测试、合规映射、风险综合），采用早期硬策略门控和默认拒绝机制

Result: 在14个标准案例评估中，精确决策匹配从10/14提升到13/14（92.9%），拒绝召回率达到1.00，必须拒绝场景的错误批准率降为0，功能适当性和合规性均为14/14

Conclusion: 策略约束的LLM推理结合显式门控和审计追踪，能够将人类可读策略转化为安全、合规且可追踪的机器决策

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Conclusion: 该框架为开发静态分析工具和智能体框架语法奠定了基础，能够形式化界定可验证系统与行为不可判定系统之间的边界。

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Motivation: 现有基准过于简化，假设推理可简化为组合关系路径，导致模型难以泛化到其他设置

Method: 引入NoRA基准，包含多个难度级别，挑战模型超越路径推理的能力

Result: 创建了一个更全面的评估框架，支持系统化关系推理领域的进一步发展

Conclusion: NoRA基准有助于推动神经网络在系统化关系推理方面的进步

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

Conclusion: 该工作通过大规模多模态代码语料库和统一模型，成功建立了视觉-程序接口，为代码智能的视觉维度发展提供了重要推动。

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

Motivation: 随着人机协作在工业5.0等范式中变得重要，需要机器能够安全有效地解释复杂人类行为。当前存在技术中心机器人框架缺乏人类行为细微模型，而描述性行为本体论又不适合实时协作解释的研究空白。

Method: 基于认知科学和模块化工程方法，开发了OntoPret本体论，提供形式化、机器可处理的框架来分类行为，包括任务偏差和欺骗性行为。

Result: 在制造和游戏两个不同用例中展示了OntoPret的适应性，并建立了关于人类意图高级推理所需的语义基础。

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

Motivation: 现实世界任务需要在不同粒度上做决策，人类擅长利用统一的认知表示，但当前基于LLM的智能体缺乏这种跨决策粒度流畅操作的能力，现有范式在高级规划和低级行动之间存在刚性分离。

Method: ReCode在单一代码表示中统一规划和行动，将高级计划视为抽象占位函数，然后递归分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到达到原始行动，这种递归结构消除了计划和行动之间的刚性边界。

Result: 大量实验表明ReCode在推理性能上显著超越先进基线，并在训练中表现出卓越的数据效率，验证了通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的有效方法。

Conclusion: 通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的强大有效方法，递归结构固有地生成丰富的多粒度训练数据，使模型能够学习分层决策过程。

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

Motivation: 研究公众对AI的态度变化，特别是在ChatGPT发布前后，以了解GenAI技术普及对公众接受度的影响。

Method: 使用瑞士人口代表性的大规模两波调查（n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488），比较ChatGPT发布前后的公众态度。

Result: GenAI热潮显著降低了公众对AI的接受度，增加了对人监督的需求。认为AI“完全不可接受”的比例从23%升至30%，支持仅由人决策的比例从18%升至26%。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了行业对公众准备接受AI部署的假设，强调技术发展必须与不断变化的公众偏好保持一致的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct上实验，在多个基准测试中平均提升4.54%

Conclusion: MAE是增强LLM通用推理能力的可扩展、数据高效方法，最小化对人工监督的依赖

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

Conclusion: ALITA-G提供了从通用能力到可重用领域特定能力的原理性路径，提高了复杂推理任务的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI音乐生成在吉他等特定乐器的可控合成方面表达力有限，吉他特有的演奏技巧在其他音乐符号格式中难以准确表示。

Method: 使用吉他谱作为输入，先通过样本虚拟乐器渲染音频，然后使用流匹配进行风格转换，将虚拟乐器音频转换为更逼真的声音。

Result: 模型训练和推理速度快，仅需不到6小时的训练数据，客观评估和听力测试显示生成的吉他音频真实度显著提高。

Conclusion: GuitarFlow通过吉他谱引导和流匹配风格转换，有效提升了电吉他合成的真实性和表达力，为特定乐器合成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Music generation in the audio domain using artificial intelligence (AI) has
witnessed steady progress in recent years. However for some instruments,
particularly the guitar, controllable instrument synthesis remains limited in
expressivity. We introduce GuitarFlow, a model designed specifically for
electric guitar synthesis. The generative process is guided using tablatures,
an ubiquitous and intuitive guitar-specific symbolic format. The tablature
format easily represents guitar-specific playing techniques (e.g. bends, muted
strings and legatos), which are more difficult to represent in other common
music notation formats such as MIDI. Our model relies on an intermediary step
of first rendering the tablature to audio using a simple sample-based virtual
instrument, then performing style transfer using Flow Matching in order to
transform the virtual instrument audio into more realistic sounding examples.
This results in a model that is quick to train and to perform inference,
requiring less than 6 hours of training data. We present the results of
objective evaluation metrics, together with a listening test, in which we show
significant improvement in the realism of the generated guitar audio from
tablatures.

Result: 研究发现两个权衡：增加tf可提高连贯性但需要更快推理；增加k可提高吞吐量但会降低伴奏质量。最大似然流式训练不足以实现连贯伴奏。

Conclusion: 需要开发具有前瞻性和代理性目标的先进训练方法，以支持实时即兴演奏场景。

Abstract: Music generation models can produce high-fidelity coherent accompaniment
given complete audio input, but are limited to editing and loop-based
workflows. We study real-time audio-to-audio accompaniment: as a model hears an
input audio stream (e.g., a singer singing), it has to also simultaneously
generate in real-time a coherent accompanying stream (e.g., a guitar
accompaniment). In this work, we propose a model design considering inevitable
system delays in practical deployment with two design variables: future
visibility $t_f$, the offset between the output playback time and the latest
input time used for conditioning, and output chunk duration $k$, the number of
frames emitted per call. We train Transformer decoders across a grid of
$(t_f,k)$ and show two consistent trade-offs: increasing effective $t_f$
improves coherence by reducing the recency gap, but requires faster inference
to stay within the latency budget; increasing $k$ improves throughput but
results in degraded accompaniment due to a reduced update rate. Finally, we
observe that naive maximum-likelihood streaming training is insufficient for
coherent accompaniment where future context is not available, motivating
advanced anticipatory and agentic objectives for live jamming.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出多尺度CIF（M-CIF）机制，通过整合字符和音素级监督来增强非自回归语音识别的声学-文本对齐稳定性，在德语和法语上显著降低词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CIF机制在英语和法语等语言中由于缺乏细粒度指导而导致稳定性下降，需要改进对齐质量。

Method: M-CIF通过逐步蒸馏字符和音素级监督到子词表示中，实现多级对齐，增强声学-文本对齐的鲁棒性。

Result: 相比Paraformer基线，在CommonVoice上德语WER降低4.21%，法语降低3.05%；定义了音素混淆错误和空格相关分割错误作为评估指标。

Conclusion: 音素和字符层对于增强渐进式CIF对齐至关重要，多尺度监督能有效提升不同语言的识别性能。

Abstract: The Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) mechanism provides effective
alignment for non-autoregressive (NAR) speech recognition. This mechanism
creates a smooth and monotonic mapping from acoustic features to target tokens,
achieving performance on Mandarin competitive with other NAR approaches.
However, without finer-grained guidance, its stability degrades in some
languages such as English and French. In this paper, we propose Multi-scale CIF
(M-CIF), which performs multi-level alignment by integrating character and
phoneme level supervision progressively distilled into subword representations,
thereby enhancing robust acoustic-text alignment. Experiments show that M-CIF
reduces WER compared to the Paraformer baseline, especially on CommonVoice by
4.21% in German and 3.05% in French. To further investigate these gains, we
define phonetic confusion errors (PE) and space-related segmentation errors
(SE) as evaluation metrics. Analysis of these metrics across different M-CIF
settings reveals that the phoneme and character layers are essential for
enhancing progressive CIF alignment.

*Parthasaarathy Sudarsanam,Sebastian Braun,Hannes Gamper*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于一阶Ambisonics(FOA)的离散神经空间音频编解码器，将4通道FOA音频压缩至0.9kbps，同时保持方向线索的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经音频编解码器在单声道和立体声信号中已被广泛研究，但空间音频领域仍相对未被探索。

Method: 基于WavTokenizer架构扩展支持4通道FOA信号，并引入新颖的空间一致性损失来在高度压缩表示下保持重构信号中的方向线索。

Result: 在模拟混响混合、非混响干净语音和真实房间脉冲响应的FOA混合上评估，平均角度误差分别为13.76°、3.96°和25.83°。离散潜在表示为下游空间音频任务提供了有用特征。

Conclusion: 该编解码器成功实现了FOA空间音频的高效压缩，同时保持了方向精度，并为下游任务提供了有价值的特征表示。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs have been widely studied for mono and stereo signals, but
spatial audio remains largely unexplored. We present the first discrete neural
spatial audio codec for first-order ambisonics (FOA). Building on the
WavTokenizer architecture, we extend it to support four-channel FOA signals and
introduce a novel spatial consistency loss to preserve directional cues in the
reconstructed signals under a highly compressed representation. Our codec
compresses 4-channel FOA audio at 24 kHz into 75 discrete tokens per second,
corresponding to a bit rate of 0.9 kbps. Evaluations on simulated reverberant
mixtures, non-reverberant clean speech, and FOA mixtures with real room impulse
responses show accurate reconstruction, with mean angular errors of
13.76{\deg}, 3.96{\deg}, and 25.83{\deg}, respectively, across the three
conditions. In addition, discrete latent representations derived from our codec
provide useful features for downstream spatial audio tasks, as demonstrated on
sound event localization and detection with STARSS23 real recordings.

TL;DR: PromptReverb是一个两阶段生成框架，通过变分自编码器将带限RIR上采样至全频带质量，并使用基于整流流匹配的条件扩散变换器模型从自然语言描述生成RIR，显著提升了感知质量和声学精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前RIR生成面临的两个基本限制：全频带RIR数据集的稀缺性，以及现有模型无法从多样化输入模态生成声学准确响应的能力。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）变分自编码器将带限RIR上采样至48kHz全频带质量；2）基于整流流匹配的条件扩散变换器模型，从自然语言描述生成RIR。

Result: PromptReverb生成的RIR在感知质量和声学精度上优于现有方法，平均RT60误差为8.8%，而广泛使用的基线方法为-37%，并能产生更真实的房间声学参数。

Conclusion: 该方法在虚拟现实、建筑声学和音频制作等需要灵活、高质量RIR合成的实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Room impulse response (RIR) generation remains a critical challenge for
creating immersive virtual acoustic environments. Current methods suffer from
two fundamental limitations: the scarcity of full-band RIR datasets and the
inability of existing models to generate acoustically accurate responses from
diverse input modalities. We present PromptReverb, a two-stage generative
framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach combines a variational
autoencoder that upsamples band-limited RIRs to full-band quality (48 kHz), and
a conditional diffusion transformer model based on rectified flow matching that
generates RIRs from descriptions in natural language. Empirical evaluation
demonstrates that PromptReverb produces RIRs with superior perceptual quality
and acoustic accuracy compared to existing methods, achieving 8.8% mean RT60
error compared to -37% for widely used baselines and yielding more realistic
room-acoustic parameters. Our method enables practical applications in virtual
reality, architectural acoustics, and audio production where flexible,
high-quality RIR synthesis is essential.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了三种最先进的多模态大语言模型在音乐理解任务上的表现，发现模型在MIDI符号输入上表现优异，但在音频输入上存在明显的感知差距，表明当前系统擅长符号推理但缺乏可靠的音频聆听能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型声称的"音乐理解"能力，通过分离感知限制（音频vs MIDI输入）、示例曝光（零样本vs少样本）和推理策略等变量，明确界定感知与推理的边界。

Method: 对Gemini 2.5 Pro、Gemini 2.5 Flash和Qwen2.5-Omni三种模型进行基准测试，涵盖三个核心音乐技能：切分音评分、移调检测和和弦质量识别。使用LogicLM框架结合符号求解器进行结构化推理。

Result: 模型在MIDI输入上表现接近天花板水平，但在音频输入上准确率显著下降。推理策略和少样本提示带来的改进有限。Gemini Pro在大多数条件下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 当前系统擅长符号推理（MIDI），但尚未具备可靠的音频聆听能力。研究方法和数据集为构建稳健的音频优先音乐系统提供了明确指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) claim "musical understanding" via
evaluations that conflate listening with score reading. We benchmark three SOTA
LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen2.5-Omni) across three core
music skills: Syncopation Scoring, Transposition Detection, and Chord Quality
Identification. Moreover, we separate three sources of variability: (i)
perceptual limitations (audio vs. MIDI inputs), (ii) exposure to examples
(zero- vs. few-shot manipulations), and (iii) reasoning strategies (Standalone,
CoT, LogicLM). For the latter we adapt LogicLM, a framework combining LLMs with
symbolic solvers to perform structured reasoning, to music. Results reveal a
clear perceptual gap: models perform near ceiling on MIDI but show accuracy
drops on audio. Reasoning and few-shot prompting offer minimal gains. This is
expected for MIDI, where performance reaches saturation, but more surprising
for audio, where LogicLM, despite near-perfect MIDI accuracy, remains notably
brittle. Among models, Gemini Pro achieves the highest performance across most
conditions. Overall, current systems reason well over symbols (MIDI) but do not
yet "listen" reliably from audio. Our method and dataset make the
perception-reasoning boundary explicit and offer actionable guidance for
building robust, audio-first music systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SAO-Instruct是一个基于Stable Audio Open的音频编辑模型，能够使用任意自由形式的自然语言指令来编辑音频片段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在根据文本描述合成高保真音频方面取得了显著进展，但使用自然语言编辑现有音频仍然未被充分探索。当前方法要么需要完整描述编辑后的音频，要么局限于预定义的编辑指令，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 基于Stable Audio Open构建模型，使用Prompt-to-Prompt、DDPM反转和手动编辑流程创建音频编辑三元组数据集（输入音频、编辑指令、输出音频）进行训练。

Result: 尽管部分训练数据是合成的，但模型能够很好地泛化到真实音频片段和未见过的编辑指令。在客观指标上表现有竞争力，在主观听力研究中优于其他音频编辑方法。

Conclusion: SAO-Instruct展示了使用自由形式自然语言指令编辑音频的能力，为未来研究提供了代码和模型权重。

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing
high-fidelity audio from short textual descriptions. However, editing existing
audio using natural language has remained largely underexplored. Current
approaches either require the complete description of the edited audio or are
constrained to predefined edit instructions that lack flexibility. In this
work, we introduce SAO-Instruct, a model based on Stable Audio Open capable of
editing audio clips using any free-form natural language instruction. To train
our model, we create a dataset of audio editing triplets (input audio, edit
instruction, output audio) using Prompt-to-Prompt, DDPM inversion, and a manual
editing pipeline. Although partially trained on synthetic data, our model
generalizes well to real in-the-wild audio clips and unseen edit instructions.
We demonstrate that SAO-Instruct achieves competitive performance on objective
metrics and outperforms other audio editing approaches in a subjective
listening study. To encourage future research, we release our code and model
weights.

Motivation: 音频深度伪造威胁日益严重，现有检测器在遇到新的合成方法和不同说话人时泛化能力不足，限制了实际应用的可靠性。

Method: 构建包含六种不同合成系统的基准测试，每个系统使用不相交的说话人集合，严格评估检测器在生成模型和说话人身份同时变化时的泛化性能。

Result: TWINSHIFT基准测试揭示了重要的鲁棒性差距，发现了被忽视的局限性，为开发音频深度伪造检测系统提供了原则性指导。

Conclusion: TWINSHIFT基准测试能够有效评估音频深度伪造检测器的鲁棒性，填补了现有评估方法的空白，有助于推动更可靠的检测系统开发。

Abstract: Audio deepfakes pose a growing threat, already exploited in fraud and
misinformation. A key challenge is ensuring detectors remain robust to unseen
synthesis methods and diverse speakers, since generation techniques evolve
quickly. Despite strong benchmark results, current systems struggle to
generalize to new conditions limiting real-world reliability. To address this,
we introduce TWINSHIFT, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate detection
robustness under strictly unseen conditions. Our benchmark is constructed from
six different synthesis systems, each paired with disjoint sets of speakers,
allowing for a rigorous assessment of how well detectors generalize when both
the generative model and the speaker identity change. Through extensive
experiments, we show that TWINSHIFT reveals important robustness gaps, uncover
overlooked limitations, and provide principled guidance for developing ADD
systems. The TWINSHIFT benchmark can be accessed at

Motivation: 现有神经音频编解码器虽然在超低比特率下提供优越的语音质量，但在边缘部署场景中面临计算资源限制、低延迟要求和抗背景噪声/混响能力等实际应用障碍。

Method: 通过组织挑战赛，提供标准化训练数据集、两个基线系统和全面评估框架，支持参与者开发适用于资源受限应用的神经和混合编解码器。

Result: 挑战赛预期将为编解码器设计和相关下游音频任务提供有价值的见解。

Conclusion: 该挑战赛旨在推动在资源受限环境下神经音频编解码技术的发展和实际应用。

Abstract: While recent neural audio codecs deliver superior speech quality at ultralow
bitrates over traditional methods, their practical adoption is hindered by
obstacles related to low-resource operation and robustness to acoustic
distortions. Edge deployment scenarios demand codecs that operate under
stringent compute constraints while maintaining low latency and bitrate. The
presence of background noise and reverberation further necessitates designs
that are resilient to such degradations. The performance of neural codecs under
these constraints and their integration with speech enhancement remain largely
unaddressed. To catalyze progress in this area, we introduce the 2025
Low-Resource Audio Codec Challenge, which targets the development of neural and
hybrid codecs for resource-constrained applications. Participants are supported
with a standardized training dataset, two baseline systems, and a comprehensive
evaluation framework. The challenge is expected to yield valuable insights
applicable to both codec design and related downstream audio tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种训练方法，使音频自编码器在高压缩的一致性自编码器中诱导线性行为，实现同质性和可加性，从而支持直观的潜在空间代数操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频自编码器学习有用的压缩音频表示，但其非线性潜在空间阻碍了直观的代数操作，如混合或缩放。

Method: 使用数据增强的简单训练方法，在不改变模型架构或损失函数的情况下，在高压缩一致性自编码器中诱导线性，实现同质性（对标量增益的等变性）和可加性（解码器保持加法）。

Result: 使用该方法训练的CAE在编码器和解码器中都表现出线性行为，同时保持重建保真度。在音乐源合成和分离任务中通过简单的潜在算术测试了实用性。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种构建结构化潜在空间的直接技术，实现了更直观和高效的音频处理。

Abstract: Audio autoencoders learn useful, compressed audio representations, but their
non-linear latent spaces prevent intuitive algebraic manipulation such as
mixing or scaling. We introduce a simple training methodology to induce
linearity in a high-compression Consistency Autoencoder (CAE) by using data
augmentation, thereby inducing homogeneity (equivariance to scalar gain) and
additivity (the decoder preserves addition) without altering the model's
architecture or loss function. When trained with our method, the CAE exhibits
linear behavior in both the encoder and decoder while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. We test the practical utility of our learned space on music source
composition and separation via simple latent arithmetic. This work presents a
straightforward technique for constructing structured latent spaces, enabling
more intuitive and efficient audio processing.

TL;DR: 提出了ISA-Bench基准来评估大型音频语言模型对指令表述的敏感性，发现现有模型存在显著的指令敏感性，并通过微调Qwen2-Audio改善了指令跟随性能，但也引发了灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型对指令表述高度敏感，影响指令跟随率和任务性能，但缺乏系统评估这种敏感性的基准。

Method: 构建ISA-Bench动态基准，从指令描述、输出格式和任务组合三个维度评估指令敏感性；通过微调Qwen2-Audio在复杂指令变体数据集上改善性能。

Result: 实验显示即使最先进的LALMs也存在显著指令敏感性，导致基本音频理解任务性能下降；微调后指令跟随性能显著提升，但引发了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: ISA-Bench为评估和改进LALMs的指令敏感性提供了标准化基准，强调了实际应用中指令鲁棒性音频理解的重要性。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), which couple acoustic perception with
large language models (LLMs) to extract and understand diverse information from
audio, have attracted intense interest from both academic and industrial
communities. However, existing LALMs are highly sensitive to how instructions
are phrased, affecting both (i) instruction-following rates and (ii) task
performance. Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive
evaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark
evaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction
description, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source
and proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy
under controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even
state-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to
degraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this
issue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex
instruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in
instruction-following performance. However, this also induces nontrivial
catastrophic forgetting: the model loses some previously mastered task
capabilities when exposed to new instruction styles. Our benchmark provides a
standardized basis for assessing and improving instruction sensitivity in
LALMs, underscoring the need for instruction-robust audio understanding in
real-world pipelines.

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现早期故障检测和定位，显著减少调查时间，弥合分布式系统中交易状态分散在多个实体间的可观测性差距。

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化的一阶理论来预测Transformer在低精度训练中的前向误差放大问题，通过三个可解释的诊断指标来量化自注意力层的稳定性，并提供了实用的早期预警信号和缓解方法。


<details>

Motivation: 低精度训练的Transformer会遭受前向误差放大问题，需要理论工具来预测和理解这种不稳定性。

Method: 开发了模块化的一阶理论，推导了自注意力层的稳定性边界，包含三个诊断指标：分数尺度比、行向softmax敏感度和值条件数，并引入精度和宽度感知的LayerNorm指标。

Result: 在Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10上的实验表明，组合预测器能准确跟踪不同精度间的误差失配，时间序列最大softmax敏感度可作为早期预警信号，基于LayerNorm指标的微小调整能有效稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该理论提供了可操作的、无量纲的诊断工具，能够解释自注意力的脆弱性、预测不稳定性，并指导最小侵入性的缓解措施。

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络训练中由于层谱条件数过大导致的优化不稳定和性能下降问题，特别是在对抗性设置下。

Method: 使用Chebyshev矩正则化，通过控制谱边界和内部形状，采用解耦的混合规则来保持任务梯度。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，CMR将平均层条件数从约3900降低到约3.4，梯度幅度增加，测试精度从约10%提升到约86%。

Conclusion: 支持优化驱动的谱预处理方法，直接引导模型进入良好条件状态以实现稳定准确的学习。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models
toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为具有基础深度学习知识的读者提供扩散模型的概念性和数学基础理解，追溯其起源并展示不同公式化方法如何从共享数学思想中产生。

Method: 扩散模型通过定义前向过程将数据逐渐破坏为噪声，然后学习反向过程将噪声转换回数据。提供了三种互补视角：变分视角（逐步去噪）、基于分数的视角（学习数据分布梯度）和基于流的视角（学习速度场）。

Result: 建立了扩散模型的统一数学框架，表明这些不同视角共享一个共同骨干：时间依赖的速度场，其流动将简单先验传输到数据分布。采样相当于求解将噪声演化为数据的微分方程。

Conclusion: 扩散模型提供了一个强大的生成建模框架，通过连续轨迹将噪声转换为数据，为可控生成、高效采样和直接映射学习等扩展应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误吸严重影响手术患者发病率和死亡率，需要开发预测模型以便及时采取预防措施

Method: 从MIMIC-IV数据库中识别826名术后误吸患者，使用XGBoost、多层感知机和随机森林三种ML模型，采用增强逆概率加权进行因果分析

Result: ML模型AUROC达0.86，灵敏度77.3%；阿片类药物最大日剂量、住院时间和年龄是最重要预测因子；男性误吸风险是女性的1.5倍，且阿片剂量高27%

Conclusion: ML模型能有效预测术后误吸风险；阿片类药物剂量和手术部位显著影响误吸风险；性别差异需要进一步研究

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

*Larkin Liu,Jalal Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种在线专家混合算法：基于UCB的连续消除聚合投票和在线加权多数投票，用于动态组合多个专家模型以提升整体性能，并在LLM在线微调中验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在上下文环境中如何最优聚合专家委员会输出以获得最佳准确性的问题，特别是在需要动态调整专家权重的在线学习场景中。

Method: 1. 结合聚合投票与UCB驱动的连续消除算法，高效剪枝次优探索动作；2. 使用在线加权多数投票机制，根据各专家的预测能力按比例分配投票权重。

Result: 在理想情况下推导了bandit设置中的遗憾理论保证，并通过实证结果验证了算法有效性，特别是在LLM在线微调应用中展示了性能提升。

Conclusion: 为组合多个专家模型提供了新的方法论和无遗憾保证，能够显著提升聚合模型的整体性能。

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

*Shifeng Xu,Yanzhu Liu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种统计测量扩散模型预测误差的方法，并开发了Variance-Reduction Guidance (VRG)技术来减少这种误差，无需模型微调或修改即可提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中存在预测误差，这些误差会随着采样步骤累积，从而降低生成质量。需要一种方法来测量和缓解这种误差。

Method: VRG方法通过统计测量预测误差，在预定义的采样轨迹中寻找新的轨迹，保持相同采样步数但产生更高质量结果。适用于条件和非条件生成。

Result: 在多个数据集和基线模型上的实验表明，VRG能显著提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: VRG是一种有效的技术，能够在不修改模型的情况下减少扩散模型采样过程中的预测误差累积，提高生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

TL;DR: LLEMA是一个结合大语言模型科学知识与化学进化规则的材料设计框架，通过迭代生成候选材料、评估物理化学性质和多目标优化，在14个实际任务中实现了比生成式和纯LLM基线更高的命中率和帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料发现需要在巨大的化学和结构空间中导航，同时满足多个通常相互冲突的目标，因此需要一种能够结合科学知识并处理多目标优化的统一框架。

Method: LLEMA框架将大语言模型的科学知识与化学进化规则和基于记忆的优化相结合，每个迭代中LLM在明确属性约束下提出候选材料，代理增强的oracle估计物理化学性质，多目标评分器更新成功/失败记忆以指导后续生成。

Result: 在14个现实任务（涵盖电子、能源、涂层、光学和航空航天领域）中，LLEMA发现的候选材料在化学合理性、热力学稳定性和属性对齐方面表现优异，比生成式和纯LLM基线具有更高的命中率和更强的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 通过强制执行可合成性和多目标权衡，LLEMA为加速实际材料发现提供了一条原则性路径，消融研究证实了规则引导生成、基于记忆的优化和代理预测的重要性。

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PCC-MJO深度学习框架作为通用后处理器，修正动力模型对MJO的预测，将有效预报范围延长2-8天，并缓解"海洋大陆障碍"问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是全球天气和气候极端事件的重要驱动因子，但在业务动力模型中的预测仍然具有挑战性，有效预报通常仅限于3-4周。

Method: 采用两阶段模型：首先使用物理信息3D U-Net修正时空场误差，然后使用针对预报技能优化的LSTM精炼MJO的RMM指数。

Result: 应用于CMA、ECMWF和NCEP三个不同业务预报时，该统一框架将有效预报范围（双变量相关>0.5）一致延长2-8天，有效缓解"海洋大陆障碍"，实现更真实的向东传播和振幅。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条物理一致、计算高效且高度可推广的途径，突破了次季节预报中长期存在的障碍。

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出了Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs)，一种能够精确保持一般线性变换GL(n)等变性的新型神经网络架构，适用于李代数和矩阵值数据。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的等变模型大多局限于简单对称性（如旋转），无法处理许多科学领域中出现的更广泛的一般线性变换GL(n)对称性。

Method: 引入伴随不变双线性层，实现对李代数特征和矩阵值输入的稳定等变性，无需为每个子群重新设计架构。

Conclusion: ReLNs为在李代数和矩阵值数据上学习广泛线性群对称性提供了一个实用且通用的框架。

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

Conclusion: 提出的定量分析方法和自适应损失函数能有效处理多模态不平衡问题，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法能耗高且不太可能在大脑中实现，预测编码作为更高效的脑启发算法具有潜力，但深层PC网络难以训练，需要解决这一可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用优化理论方法分析PC学习动态，将其理解为近似信任域方法；研究PC使用高阶信息的能力；基于推理动态研究提出μPC参数化方法。

Conclusion: 本研究显著推进了对PC网络推理和学习动态的基本理解，但PC要与BP竞争还需要未来研究关注硬件协同设计。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

TL;DR: MARS-M是一种结合矩阵预条件优化器Muon和方差缩减技术MARS的新优化器，在LLM训练中实现了更好的收敛速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩阵预条件优化器（如Muon）在大规模神经网络训练中比标量优化器更高效，而方差缩减技术（如MARS）能显著加速LLM预训练。为了结合两者的优势，开发了MARS-M。

Method: 将MARS的方差缩减技术与Muon矩阵预条件优化器相结合，形成新的MARS-M优化器。

Result: 理论证明MARS-M以$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$的速率收敛到一阶驻点，优于Muon的$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$。在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中，MARS-M持续产生更低的损失并在各种下游基准测试中表现更好。

Conclusion: MARS-M成功结合了矩阵预条件和方差缩减技术的优势，在理论和实践中都表现出优越性能，为大规模神经网络训练提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at

Conclusion: SNG成功整合了符号学习和神经推理，在药物设计等需要形式正确性保证的应用中表现出色。符号规范不仅约束生成过程，还提供了可解释的中间表示，有助于专家筛选和验证生成的候选分子。

Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic
models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available

*Marcelo Cerda Castillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于物理过程的坐标无关特征集，用于机场雾的短期预测，实现了在相距11650公里的不同地理位置的零样本迁移预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机场雾预测模型在地理泛化方面的挑战，因为传统机器学习模型依赖位置特定特征，难以跨站点迁移。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类器(XGBoost)在圣地亚哥机场数据上训练，采用坐标无关的物理特征集，并在其他三个机场进行零样本测试。

Result: 模型在相距11650公里的不同雾况(辐射雾、平流雾、海雾)下，AUC值达到0.923-0.947，SHAP特征分析显示能见度持续性、太阳角度和热梯度是主导因素。

Conclusion: 基于物理信息的坐标无关特征工程可以产生地理可迁移的大气预报工具，模型学习了可转移的物理关系而非站点特定模式。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

TL;DR: 提出Seq-MADAC框架，通过考虑多参数间的内在依赖关系来解决动态算法配置问题，使用顺序优势分解网络利用动作顺序信息，在合成函数和多目标优化算法配置中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多复杂算法存在多个参数间的内在依赖关系（如先确定算子类型再确定算子参数），但现有方法未考虑这些依赖关系，导致次优结果。

Method: 提出顺序多智能体DAC框架，包含顺序优势分解网络，通过顺序优势分解利用动作顺序信息来处理参数间的依赖关系。

Result: 从合成函数到多目标优化算法配置的实验表明，Seq-MADAC优于最先进的多智能体强化学习方法，并在问题类别间展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Seq-MADAC为广泛依赖感知的自动算法配置建立了新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了HAIN（分层注意力可解释网络），这是一种结合多级注意力机制、降维和解释驱动损失函数的新架构，用于复杂生物医学数据的可解释分析，在TCGA数据集上达到94.3%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集在基因组学、医疗和金融等领域的激增，迫切需要既准确又可解释的机器学习模型。传统深度学习方法缺乏透明度，阻碍了在关键决策应用中的部署。

Method: HAIN架构统一了多级注意力机制、降维和解释驱动损失函数，通过梯度加权注意力提供特征级可解释性，并通过基于原型的表示提供全局模型解释。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上的综合评估显示，HAIN实现了94.3%的分类准确率，在透明度和解释能力方面都超过了SHAP和LIME等传统后验可解释性方法，并能有效识别生物学相关的癌症生物标志物。

Conclusion: 通过协调预测准确性和可解释性，HAIN推进了精准医疗和监管合规透明AI解决方案的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

TL;DR: 本文比较了多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)与动态时间规整(DTW)在时间序列相似性度量中的表现，发现MDD在多尺度分析和非点对点对齐方面具有优势，在多个数据集上显著优于DTW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列是高维复杂数据，其高效搜索和索引一直是数据挖掘中的长期挑战。本文旨在研究新型相似性度量MDD相对于广泛使用的DTW的比较优势和局限性。

Method: 使用多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)评估时间序列相似性，该方法在多时间尺度上进行分析且避免点对点对齐。通过模拟实验和UCR档案中的95个数据集进行测试，并将两种方法应用于实际分类任务。

Result: 在许多场景中，MDD显著优于DTW，性能提升明显。在具有挑战性的真实世界分类任务中，MDD相比DTW带来了显著改进。

Conclusion: MDD在多尺度时间序列相似性度量方面具有实际应用价值，能够解决DTW在某些性能差距方面的局限性。

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

TL;DR: 提出了M-LCB算法，一种高效的UCB风格元算法，用于在预算约束下动态选择多个自适应学习算法，提供任意时间遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在流式环境、金融交易、多臂老虎机等场景中，系统需要在线动态选择多个自适应学习算法，但训练预算有限的问题。

Method: 基于UCB的元算法M-LCB，直接使用实际损失构建置信区间，无需额外优化，能反映底层专家的收敛特性。

Result: 如果每个专家实现内部遗憾O(T^α)，则M-LCB确保总体遗憾为O(√(KT/M) + (K/M)^(1-α)T^α)。

Conclusion: 这是首个在每轮预算约束下同时训练多个自适应专家时建立遗憾保证的结果，将经典老虎机范式扩展到资源有限的状态化自学习专家协调场景。

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GAPO方法，通过自适应寻找无异常值的高密度区间并使用中位数替代组均值，解决了代码编辑中奖励分布偏斜导致的优势计算失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实代码编辑场景中，奖励分布经常偏斜且包含不可预测的异常值，导致优势计算失真和噪声增加，需要更鲁棒的方法来处理这种分布问题。

Method: GAPO方法为每个提示自适应地找到无异常值的最高密度区间，然后使用该区间中位数作为自适应Q值来替代组均值进行优势计算。

Result: 在9个指令调优的LLM（3B-14B）和包含51,844个真实世界代码编辑任务的大规模内部数据集上验证，相比GRPO及其变体DAPO，在精确匹配准确率上实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: GAPO能够鲁棒地处理偏斜分布，同时保持即插即用和高效性，为代码编辑中的强化学习提供了更稳定的优势计算方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

TL;DR: RestoreLCC是一种针对剪枝后大语言模型的恢复方法，通过对比激活编辑探测关键注意力头，提取丢失组件并重新注入，实现性能恢复而不影响稀疏性和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法通常为密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的特性，导致恢复效果不佳。剪枝引起的信息损失反映在注意力激活中，选择性恢复这些信息可以显著提升模型性能。

Method: 提出RestoreLCC方法：1）通过激活编辑对比探测关键注意力头；2）从激活差异中提取丢失组件；3）将丢失组件注入对应的剪枝头进行补偿恢复。该方法兼容结构化、半结构化和非结构化剪枝方案。

Result: 大量实验表明，RestoreLCC在通用和任务特定性能恢复方面均优于现有最先进基线方法，且不损害剪枝模型的稀疏性或推理效率。

Conclusion: RestoreLCC是一种即插即用的剪枝模型恢复方法，能够有效恢复性能同时保持模型的高效性，为剪枝后模型的实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

Motivation: 手动生成商品描述耗时耗力，现有视觉语言模型存在事实幻觉问题，且单任务模型无法捕捉特征间的相互依赖关系。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法微调视觉编码器，联合训练属性预测和价格回归；引入分层生成过程，将模型预测的属性嵌入提示中传递给文本解码器。

Result: 多任务方法在价格回归上R2值提升3.6%，属性分类F1分数提升6.6%；分层生成将事实幻觉率从12.7%降至7.1%，延迟减少3.5倍，但ROUGE-L得分比直接视觉语言模型低3.5%。

Conclusion: 该架构在减少事实幻觉和提高效率方面表现优越，多任务学习和分层生成过程有效提升了生成文本的事实一致性和系统性能。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

Conclusion: COLA框架使大语言模型能够高效学习新任务，对先前任务性能影响极小，且无需保留早期训练数据，在持续学习中表现优异。

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

Motivation: 大型语言模型参数规模庞大导致计算和环境负担严重，现有压缩方法忽略层间复杂相关性，需要更有效的压缩技术。

Method: 采用量子启发的iPEPS张量网络捕获注意力机制和深度transformer层中的多向纠缠，使用TRG确保多项式时间收缩，实现可行的张量化。

Result: 在LLaMA-2 7B上实现93%内存减少、70%参数减少、50%训练加速、25%推理加速，仅损失2-3%准确率。层间纠缠分析显示深层存在冗余。

Conclusion: 现代LLM占据低维纠缠流形，KARIPAP证明了可扩展、节能和量子感知AI架构的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a

depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian

dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

Motivation: 降水临近预报面临确定性模型过度平滑无法捕捉极端事件，概率模型性能波动且难以在冲突指标上同时表现优异的问题。受大语言模型人类反馈强化学习的启发，引入偏好优化来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出SynCast方法，采用两阶段后训练框架Diffusion-SPO：第一阶段专注于降低误报率，第二阶段在保持误报率对齐的基础上进一步优化临界成功指数，实现冲突指标的协同改进。

Result: 该方法能够渐进式地对齐冲突指标，在降水临近预报中实现一致的优越性能，特别是解决了临界成功指数和误报率之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 偏好优化为降水临近预报提供了新思路，通过两阶段训练框架能够有效解决现有模型在冲突指标上的性能限制，实现更可靠的预报结果。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TowerVision是一个基于多语言文本模型Tower+构建的开源多语言视觉语言模型家族，在图像文本和视频文本任务上表现出色，特别是在文化相关任务和多模态翻译方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型大多以英语为中心设计，限制了其在多语言环境中的有效性。

Method: 通过分析多语言设计选择（如训练数据组成、编码器选择和文本主干），构建了基于Tower+的TowerVision模型，并发布了高质量视觉语言数据集VisionBlocks。

Result: TowerVision在多个多模态多语言基准测试中取得竞争性表现，在ALM-Bench、Multi30K和ViMUL-Bench上超越了基于更大数据集训练的方法。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言训练数据显著改善了跨语言泛化能力，指令调优的LLM并不总是最佳初始化点。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

*Hojin Kim,Romit Maulik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个可微分框架，利用DEIM方法进行可解释深度学习和动力系统分析，通过自适应选择插值点来增强传统DEIM的适应性，并展示了DEIM作为诊断工具分析NODE模型学习动态的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DEIM方法在投影基降阶模型中虽然能有效近似非线性项，但其固定插值点限制了处理复杂时变动态的适应性，需要开发更灵活的方法。

Method: 首先为一维粘性Burgers方程开发了可微分自适应DEIM公式，允许神经网络动态选择插值点；然后将DEIM作为分析工具应用于预训练NODE模型，研究二维涡旋合并问题中的学习动态。

Result: DEIM轨迹揭示了NODE学习动态中的物理意义特征，并暴露了其在未见流配置外推时的局限性。自适应DEIM在计算效率和物理一致性方面表现良好。

Conclusion: DEIM不仅可以作为模型降阶工具，还能作为诊断框架来理解和改进神经微分方程模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

Conclusion: 所提出的隐私保护DFL框架成功解决了多能源系统中决策聚焦学习的隐私安全问题，在保护敏感信息的同时优化了调度决策性能。

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17141981.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过跨提供商研究发现，无外部反馈的递归自我评估会导致信息变化下降，而最小接地干预能恢复信息流动，揭示了生成推理中自我纠正的结构性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大型语言模型是否真正具备反思推理能力，特别是无外部反馈的递归自我评估是否能带来实质性进展，而非仅仅是表述重构。

Method: 在三个模型提供商（OpenAI、Anthropic、Google）和四个任务家族（算术、代码、解释、反思）上进行144个推理序列测试，每个序列迭代10次，比较无接地自我批判和最小接地干预（第三次迭代时单次验证）的效果。

Result: 无接地运行中信息变化均值从早期0.193下降55%至晚期0.087；接地运行在干预后立即显示+28%的信息变化反弹，并保持非零方差；多种测量指标均显示无接触反思趋向信息闭合。

Conclusion: 生成推理中的自我纠正存在结构性限制，无独立验证者或环境的信息交换时，递归推理会趋近认知静止状态；最小接地作为耗散耦合能重新引入信息流动；跨架构一致性表明镜像循环源于共享的自回归训练目标。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，允许组合和调整其他线性判别嵌入方法，提出的方法在监督多类分类问题中表现出色。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，而传统的对抗性训练方法难以防御新出现的攻击。作者观察到新攻击往往是旧攻击技能的重组，因此提出通过技能组合训练来提高鲁棒性。

Method: 通过分析32篇攻击论文，提取并压缩对抗性技能为稀疏字典中的原始技能，然后使用ASCoT方法训练模型识别这些技能的组合，而不是孤立的攻击实例。

Result: ASCoT显著提高了对未见攻击（包括多轮越狱）的鲁棒性，同时保持了较低的过度拒绝率。研究表明扩展对抗性技能覆盖范围比单纯增加数据规模更重要。

Conclusion: 基于对抗性技能组合的训练方法能够有效防御新型越狱攻击，证明了对抗性技能字典在提高模型安全性方面的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录数据为优化风险评分工具提供了机会，但面临两个挑战：干预审查导致的仅极端类别可靠标记的部分监督问题，以及随序数距离增加的不对称误分类成本。

Method: 采用混合整数规划框架，联合优化评分权重和类别阈值，通过每个实例的可行标签集处理部分监督，纳入不对称距离感知目标，并通过最小阈值间隙防止中间类别崩溃。

Result: 开发了使用softplus损失的CSO松弛方法，在保持序数结构的同时实现高效优化。

Conclusion: 该框架支持符号限制、稀疏性和对现有工具的最小修改等治理约束，确保在临床工作流程中的实际可部署性。

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近研究发现神经网络存在瓶颈秩现象：深度较大时，基于梯度方法训练的神经网络激活和权重往往近似低秩。本文旨在探讨这一现象对泛化性能的影响。

Method: 利用神经网络权重矩阵的近似低秩结构，基于Schatten p拟范数推导泛化界，分析不同p值下的样本复杂度。

Result: 证明了泛化界依赖于权重矩阵的Schatten p拟范数：当p较小时，样本复杂度为Õ(WrL²)，其中W是宽度，L是深度，r是权重矩阵的秩；当p增大时，边界表现更类似于基于范数的边界。

Conclusion: 神经网络的低秩特性可以用于推导更紧致的泛化界，特别是在小p值时能获得更好的样本复杂度，这为理解深度神经网络泛化能力提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer中的常规注意力机制具有O(N²D)的时间复杂度，而线性注意力虽然理论上有O(ND²)的线性复杂度，但在实践中效率不如预期。

Method: 开发了线性注意力的新型前向和后向传播算法，并实现了高度优化的CUDA实现。

Result: 速度比现有技术快3.3倍，内存消耗减少3.6倍，在14亿参数语言模型训练中表现出与常规注意力相当的表达能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了线性注意力的实际效率，使其在保持表达能力的同时实现了更好的运行时性能。

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: PUNT是一种模型无关的采样器，通过识别token依赖关系并移除低置信度token，在保持条件独立性的同时优先处理高置信度预测，实现了更好的并行采样效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决掩码扩散模型并行采样中的两个冲突需求：同时更新的token必须条件独立，但高置信度预测往往相互依赖，限制了并行更新的机会。

Method: 通过近似条件独立性测试识别token依赖关系，移除冲突组中的低置信度token，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的索引集进行并行解掩码。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中比基线方法（包括顺序生成）准确率提高16%，在生成长序列时表现更优，且对超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: PUNT实现了准确性与计算效率的更好权衡，并诱导出层次化生成策略，模型先建立高级段落结构再进行局部细化，表现出类似规划的过程。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Method: DJGP在Jump Gaussian Processes基础上添加局部线性投影层，使用区域特定矩阵捕捉局部子空间结构，并在投影矩阵上放置高斯过程先验以控制模型复杂度。投影后的输入通过JGP建模来捕捉与响应的分段连续关系。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，DJGP相比现有方法具有更优越的预测精度和更可靠的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: DJGP通过两层的深度GP/JGP学习框架，成功解决了高维分段连续函数建模的挑战，提供了更准确的预测和不确定性估计。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出RECAP方法，通过动态目标重加权来防止RLVR训练中的能力退化问题，在保持通用能力的同时提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练虽然能提升数学和多模态推理能力，但会导致模型忘记基础技能，如感知和忠实性。现有正则化方法无法保证广泛知识的保留。

Method: 提出RECAP重放策略，使用动态目标重加权机制，基于收敛和不稳定性信号在线调整训练焦点，从饱和目标转向表现不佳或波动的目标。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B和7B上的实验表明，该方法有效保持通用能力，并通过更灵活的任务奖励权衡提升推理性能。

Conclusion: RECAP是一种端到端方法，无需额外模型或大量调参即可应用于现有RLVR流程，解决了能力退化问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

Motivation: 传统方法通常使用单个最小自由能结构来表示分子，但这种方法无法充分捕捉低能构象集合的特性，特别是在存在实验偏差（如PCR扩增或测序噪声）的情况下，观测丰度可能与实际结合强度不符。

Method: 引入热力学参数化的指数族随机图嵌入，将分子建模为玻尔兹曼加权的相互作用图集合，而不是单一的最小自由能结构。

Result: 在SELEX数据集上的评估表明，该方法能够实现稳健的群落检测和子图级解释，即使在存在偏差观测的情况下也能准确识别适体-配体亲和力。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于识别低丰度的适体候选物进行进一步实验评估，为存在实验偏差的生物化学数据分析提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

Motivation: 研究在函数逼近设置下，传统关于TD方法具有经验拼接优势的智慧是否仍然成立，以及MC方法是否也能实现隐式拼接。

Method: 通过实证研究比较TD和MC方法在不同神经网络容量下的经验拼接能力，分析模型规模对拼接效果的影响。

Result: MC方法也能实现经验拼接，TD方法优势较小；增加评论家网络容量能有效减少MC和TD方法的泛化差距；模型规模对拼接能力的影响大于算法选择。

Conclusion: 在大型模型时代，TD方法的拼接归纳偏置可能不再必要，拼接能力可以通过模型规模而非专门算法来实现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

Motivation: 理解深度学习模型的预测在关键应用中至关重要，现有方法难以回答反事实问题，需要开发能够评估反事实查询的模型框架。

Method: 引入因果可解释性概念，分析两类常见模型的局限性，开发构建因果可解释模型的设计框架，推导完整的图准则来确定模型架构是否支持反事实查询。

Conclusion: 实验证实了理论发现，因果可解释性与预测准确性存在根本性权衡，提出的框架为构建可解释模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统计框架来解决文本水印检测中因重复文本导致的伪随机性不完美问题，通过分层两阶段分区和最小单元概念，建立了具有严格I类错误控制的优化检测规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法假设完美的伪随机性，但实践中生成文本的重复会导致碰撞和结构化依赖，损害I类错误控制并使标准分析失效。

Method: 引入分层两阶段分区框架，核心是最小单元概念——跨单元独立但单元内允许依赖的最小分组。基于最小单元定义非渐近效率度量，将水印检测建模为极小极大假设检验问题。

Result: 应用于Gumbel-max和逆变换水印时，框架产生闭式最优规则。理论解释了为何丢弃重复统计量能提升性能，并表明除非退化，否则必须处理单元内依赖。理论和实验都证实了在严格I类错误控制下检测能力的提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为不完美伪随机性下的水印检测提供了首个原则性基础，为模型输出的可靠追踪提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

Conclusion: DPE B支持多种图神经网络方法进行PPI预测，可应用于系统生物学、药物靶点识别、通路分析和疾病机制研究。

Abstract: Computationally predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging
due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. DPEB is a
curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding
types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings),
contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and
sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are
available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure
Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses
this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.
Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest

TL;DR: 提出加权准确率(WA)作为二元分类器的评估指标，该指标与最小化总分类成本(TCC)一致，为成本敏感场景中的类别不平衡处理提供概念框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器评估指标选择缺乏共识，且存在对数据集平衡处理的误解。由于分类器优化的最终目标通常是最大化投资回报或最小化总分类成本(TCC)，需要定义与TCC最小化一致的评估指标。

Method: 定义加权准确率(WA)作为二元分类器的评估指标，建立处理类别不平衡的概念框架，提出在缺乏完全指定单位分类成本(UCCs)时估计WA权重参数的程序。

Result: WA可以表示为示例依赖量的线性组合，允许在不同数据集间比较结果，并解决开发数据集与目标数据集之间的差异。分析显示WA与TCC在示例依赖场景中具有强相关性。

Conclusion: WA提供了一个与TCC最小化一致的评估框架，阐明了在哪些场景中使用无UCCs意识的类别平衡技术或平衡指标与TCC最小化一致，在哪些场景中反而适得其反。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

Method: 使用深度确定性策略梯度方法学习资源分配策略，模拟资源分配过程并建模社区成员制度信任的变化，研究信任整合对结果的影响。

Result: 整合信任的RL算法能产生更成功的政策，特别是在组织目标不确定时；保守的信任估计能提高公平性和平均社区信任，但会降低组织成功率；外部配额干预能在某些情况下改善公平和信任。

Conclusion: 制度信任在算法设计和实施中至关重要，组织成功与社区福祉之间存在张力，需要平衡算法效率和社区公平信任的关系。

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

Conclusion: K-DAREK通过增强KKAN架构和距离感知误差机制，实现了高效、可解释的函数逼近和不确定性量化，特别适用于动态系统建模和操作符估计。

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative

optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available

TL;DR: 本文提出了线性最优传输（LOT）框架，将单细胞技术生成的高维点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间中，解决了患者间生物差异难以直接量化和比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞技术产生的高维点云数据难以直接比较不同患者间的生物差异，现有非线性方法虽然预测准确但缺乏可解释性。

Method: 采用线性最优传输框架，将不规则点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间，保持分布结构并形成患者间的配准。

Result: LOT框架实现了COVID-19患者状态的准确可解释分类，分类器权重可映射回特定标记和空间区域；支持患者来源类器官的合成数据生成；通过LOT重心获得平均细胞特征。

Conclusion: LOT框架统一了预测性能、可解释性和生成建模，为理解高维生物系统中的免疫变异和治疗效果提供了新途径。

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Motivation: 经典Mallows模型在捕捉真实世界用户偏好方面存在局限，用户通常只关注有限数量的偏好项目而对其他项目漠不关心。扩展的top-k Mallows模型能更好地符合实际应用场景。

Method: 提出了针对广义top-k Mallows模型的采样方案、计算选择概率的高效算法，以及基于观察选择数据的主动学习参数估计算法。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为关键决策场景中的分析和预测提供了新工具，并通过严格的数学分析验证了算法性能。

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

TL;DR: 提出OLLA框架，用于处理带等式和不等式约束的统计分布采样，避免昂贵的投影步骤，并提供指数收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理非凸约束集时依赖昂贵的投影步骤，无法同时处理等式和不等式约束，且缺乏严格的收敛保证。

Method: 引入过阻尼Langevin动力学与着陆校正(OLLA)框架，通过确定性校正轨迹沿约束曲面法向，避免显式投影。

Result: 在适当的正则条件下，OLLA在W2距离上以指数速度收敛到约束目标密度，计算成本优于基于投影的方法。

Conclusion: OLLA是处理等式和不等式约束采样问题的有效框架，具有理论保证和实际计算优势。

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

Conclusion: PFΔ数据集为电力潮流计算提供了全面的基准，揭示了现有方法的局限性，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

TL;DR: 该研究实证分析了三种剪枝方法和三种量化方法在不同GNN模型上的效果，发现非结构化细粒度和全局剪枝能显著减小模型尺寸(50%)，而量化方法对精度、推理时间和模型尺寸的影响因数据集而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络(GNNs)在图结构数据学习方面具有高精度，但存在计算和资源成本高的问题。神经网络压缩方法可以在保持合理精度的同时减小模型尺寸。

Method: 使用三种剪枝方法和三种量化方法，在包括图分类、节点分类和链接预测任务的不同GNN模型上进行实验，实验基于Cora、Proteins和BBBP三个图数据集。

Result: 非结构化细粒度和全局剪枝能显著减少模型尺寸(50%)，并在微调剪枝模型后保持甚至提高精度。量化方法在不同数据集上对精度、推理时间和模型尺寸的影响各不相同。

Conclusion: 剪枝和量化是有效的GNN压缩技术，非结构化剪枝在保持精度方面表现优异，而量化方法的效果取决于具体的数据集和应用场景。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Deep Gaussian Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM)方法，用于函数空间映射学习，结合高斯过程的线性和非线性变换，解决了现有方法在复杂非线性建模和不确定性量化方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有函数回归方法（如函数线性模型和神经算子）要么无法捕捉复杂非线性关系，要么在噪声、稀疏和不规则采样数据下缺乏可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 设计基于高斯过程的线性和非线性变换序列，利用核的积分变换、GP插值和从GP采样的非线性激活函数。通过固定位置下的离散近似简化实现，并采用诱导点和白化变换进行变分学习。

Result: 在真实世界和PDE基准数据集上的实验表明，DGPFM在预测性能和不确定性校准方面具有优势。

Conclusion: DGPFM方法有效解决了函数空间映射学习中的非线性建模和不确定性量化问题，在多个应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多动作RMABs的神经索引策略(NIP)，通过神经网络学习臂-动作对的预算感知索引，并使用可微背包层进行约束优化，实现端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RMAB假设二元动作和单一全局预算，但现实场景如医疗保健涉及多种干预措施和异构成本约束，需要更灵活的框架。

Method: 使用神经网络学习臂-动作对的索引，通过熵正则化最优传输问题构建可微背包层，统一索引预测和约束优化。

Result: NIP在数百个臂的规模下实现接近最优性能(与oracle策略差距在5%以内)，同时严格满足异构预算约束。

Conclusion: 建立了一个通用、理论可靠且可扩展的框架，用于在复杂资源受限环境中学习基于索引的策略。

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模在表示学习中很强大，但在医学成像等挑战性领域的直接应用有限：没有任务对齐的单纯生成无法为临床使用提供坚实基础。

Method: 构建为可逆和可微分双射的层次结构，其中雅可比行列式在子变换间分解，支持精确似然计算和稳定优化，通过条件化类标签实现可控样本合成和原则性类概率估计。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Flow是数据有限领域中生成和分类的有效策略，对隐私保护增强、鲁棒泛化和可信医疗AI有直接益处。

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

Result: 从GPT-4.1轨迹蒸馏的SFT模型性能相当但体积小56倍，RL在匹配训练测试条件下带来7-20%绝对提升。思考模式表现持平或更差。SFT和RL模型在跨环境泛化上失败。

Conclusion: 训练-测试环境匹配对于构建可靠的现实世界代码修复代理至关重要，模型在匹配条件下表现良好但缺乏跨环境泛化能力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

Conclusion: 该模型利用预训练权重可在单个epoch内收敛，大幅降低了训练成本和碳足迹，对机器学习可持续发展的挑战具有重要意义。

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

Conclusion: AniDS能够自适应地抑制键合方向的噪声，与物理化学原理一致，为3D分子预训练提供了更准确的去噪框架。

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性地研究神经组合优化(NCO)模型的可解释性，通过多种探测任务分析模型表示，并提出CS-Probing工具进行深度分析，揭示了NCO模型编码的关键信息及其归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NCO模型虽然性能优异，但其表示和决策原理仍是黑盒，这阻碍了学术研究和实际部署。需要深入理解NCO模型的内部机制。

Method: 使用多种探测任务分析NCO模型表示，并引入CS-Probing工具来检验探测过程中的系数和统计显著性。

Result: 发现NCO模型编码了解决方案构建所需的低层信息，同时捕获了促进更好决策的高层知识。CS-Probing揭示了不同NCO模型的归纳偏置、模型泛化的直接证据，以及与特定知识相关的关键嵌入维度。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统性地解释黑盒NCO模型，展示了探测作为分析其内部机制的有前景工具，为NCO社区提供了重要见解，并通过代码改进提升了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

TL;DR: TN-SHAP使用张量网络替代模型，将Shapley值的O(2^n)联盟枚举简化为少量评估，显著加速特征交互分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Shapley值计算需要枚举所有特征联盟组合，计算复杂度为O(2^n)，在大规模特征场景下不可行

Method: 将预测器的局部行为表示为因子化多线性映射，利用张量网络构建替代模型，通过少量针对性评估提取k阶Shapley交互

Result: 在UCI数据集上，方法在保持精度的同时实现25-1000倍加速，显著减少评估次数

Conclusion: TN-SHAP为大规模特征交互分析提供了高效可行的解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

Method: 结合神经元功能归因识别知识通用神经元和知识特定神经元，引入熵引导的动态稀疏掩码定位目标知识相关神经元

Result: 在数千次顺序编辑实验中，NMKE在保持高编辑成功率和模型通用能力方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: NMKE通过细粒度神经元级编辑框架，实现了更精确、更稳定的终身知识编辑

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了"独裁者客户端"这一新型恶意参与者类别，能够完全消除其他客户端对服务器模型的贡献，同时保留自己的贡献。论文分析了单/多独裁者客户端在不同协作模式下的攻击策略及其对联邦学习收敛性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性使其容易受到恶意客户端的攻击，现有研究缺乏对能够完全控制全局模型训练过程的恶意参与者的系统分析。

Method: 提出具体的攻击策略，理论分析单/多独裁者客户端在不同协作模式（合作、独立行动、背叛联盟）下对全局模型收敛的影响，并通过计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准进行实证评估。

Result: 独裁者客户端能够有效消除其他客户端的贡献，多独裁者客户端在不同协作模式下对模型收敛产生复杂影响，理论分析与实证结果一致。

Conclusion: 联邦学习系统需要更强的安全机制来防御独裁者客户端攻击，特别是在多恶意参与者协作的复杂场景下。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于排序的嵌入方法β_A，改进了嵌入维度D的上界并提供了下界，同时证明了其双Lipschitz失真与n的二次方相关且与d无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度学习应用中，需要处理图节点排列不变性的问题。基于排序的嵌入方法β_A能够提供这种不变性，但之前的研究存在两个关键问题：最优嵌入维度D未知，以及缺乏双Lipschitz常数的估计。

Method: 研究排序嵌入β_A: X ↦ ↓(XA)，其中↓表示矩阵的列排序。通过构造特定的矩阵A来分析嵌入的维度和双Lipschitz性质。

Result: 改进了嵌入维度D的上界，提供了最小注入维度的下界。证明了β_A的双Lipschitz失真与n成二次方关系且与d无关，同时证明了失真至少为Ω(√n)。

Conclusion: 该研究在基于排序的嵌入方法的理论分析方面取得了重要进展，为图深度学习中的排列不变性提供了更深入的理论基础。

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用预训练EEG模型在处理复杂任务如情感识别时存在困难，因为任务特定特征与广泛预训练方法不匹配。需要解决跨数据集分布偏移、情感类别定义不一致和个体间差异大的问题。

Method: 使用跨数据集协方差对齐损失来对齐不同数据集的二阶统计特性；提出混合编码器，结合类Mamba线性注意力通道编码器和时空动态模型来捕捉EEG的长期依赖和复杂动态。

Result: 在少样本情感识别中AUROC平均提升4.57%，在零样本泛化到新数据集时准确率提升11.92%。多数据集联合预训练比单数据集训练性能提升8.55%，且性能随预训练数据集数量增加而提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为任务特定预训练提供了可扩展框架，并展示了其在可泛化情感计算中的优势。

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在有损压缩领域的应用，在重建保真度和压缩比之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用掩码语言模型作为解压缩器，预测掩码内容并存储基于排名的修正，创建残差通道进行率失真控制。

Result: EPC在精确比特计算和率失真分析中始终优于预测掩码基线，以显著更低的比特率提供更优的保真度。

Conclusion: EPC通过更有效地利用模型内在知识，在有损文本压缩中实现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

Motivation: 现有预训练模型在不同设计选择下表现出不同的泛化行为，某些模型能掌握其他模型无法获得的数据特定洞察。论文旨在利用这种模型多样性作为改进模型性能的辅助资源。

Method: 提出数据分区策略，让预训练模型自主选择学生或教师角色，实现双向知识转移。该方法可扩展到多个模型间的知识转移。

Result: 在图像分类中，ViT-B通过双向知识转移性能提升约1.4%；在语义分割中，所有评估指标均得到提升；在视频显著性预测中达到新的最先进水平；多模型知识转移使所有参与模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用模型库作为辅助知识源是有效的模型改进策略，通过自主角色分配和双向知识转移能显著提升各种任务的性能。

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

Conclusion: 该交互式框架通过帮助用户理解模型在公平性-性能平衡以及驱动预测的特征方面的差异，促进了明智的决策制定。

Abstract: In the context of algorithmic decision-making, fair machine learning methods
often yield multiple models that balance predictive fairness and performance in
varying degrees. This diversity introduces a challenge for stakeholders who
must select a model that aligns with their specific requirements and values. To
address this, we propose an interactive framework that assists in navigating
and interpreting the trade-offs across a portfolio of models. Our approach
leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

Motivation: 研究层剪枝对长链推理能力的影响，特别是对测试时缩放机制的影响，因为现有方法主要关注通用知识任务的性能保持，而忽略了推理这种更脆弱但关键的能力。

Method: 通过广泛的实验研究层剪枝对测试时缩放的影响，分析剪枝后模型在长推理基准上的性能变化，并尝试使用标准监督微调来恢复受损的测试时缩放能力。

Result: 剪枝即使1-2层也会严重损害测试时缩放，长推理基准性能急剧下降，而知识密集和浅层推理任务性能保持稳定；标准微调方法无法恢复已恶化的测试时缩放能力。

Conclusion: 层剪枝对推理密集型大语言模型存在根本性风险，需要重新思考层剪枝策略，并开发能够保持推理鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

Conclusion: LUNA成功解决了EEG电极布局异构性问题，提供了一个可扩展的基础模型，在多个下游任务中表现出色，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

Conclusion: 真正的智能涉及识别和管理自身知识的局限性，'知道何时不知道'的能力将成为稳健可靠系统的标志。

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

### [390] [Does Homophily Help in Robust Test-time Node Classification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22289)
*Yan Jiang,Ruihong Qiu,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于同质性的测试时图结构转换方法GrapHoST，通过调整测试图的同质性水平来提升预训练GNN模型在节点分类任务中的鲁棒性和性能，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的测试图常存在数据质量问题和分布偏移，这会显著降低预训练模型的鲁棒性和性能。研究发现通过调整测试图的同质性水平可以改善模型表现。

Method: 开发了同质性预测器来判别测试边，根据预测的同质性分数置信度进行自适应的测试时图结构转换。在同质图中增加同质性，在异质图中减少同质性。

Result: 在9个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，GrapHoST在各种测试时数据质量问题下都能取得最先进的性能，提升幅度最高达10.92%。

Conclusion: 基于同质性的测试时图结构转换是提升预训练GNN模型鲁棒性的有效方法，GrapHoST方法在多种场景下都表现出色。

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at
https://github.com/YanJiangJerry/GrapHoST.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一个名为MASER的MASLD预测模型，使用LASSO逻辑回归和公平性后处理，在大型电子健康记录数据库中实现了竞争性性能（AUROC 0.84）和跨种族亚组的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MASLD影响约33%的美国成年人，是常见的慢性肝病。早期检测很重要，因为生活方式干预可以预防疾病进展。需要开发公平、严谨且可重复的预测模型。

Method: 评估了LASSO逻辑回归、随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络，使用临床特征子集和SHAP排名前10的特征。应用均等机会后处理方法减少种族亚组间的真阳性率差异。

Result: 训练数据59,492人，验证24,198人，测试25,188人。公平性调整前：AUROC 0.84，准确率78%，敏感性72%，特异性79%，F1分数0.617。调整后：准确率81%，特异性94%，敏感性降至41%，F1分数0.515。

Conclusion: MASER模型在MASLD预测中实现了竞争性性能，与先前报告的集成和基于树的模型相当。可解释模型可以在不同患者群体中实现预测性能和公平性的平衡。

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实验室检测依赖侵入性静脉采样且存在延迟，心电图作为非侵入性、广泛可用的信号，有望实现快速实验室指标估计。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，在斯坦福MC-MED数据集上微调大规模预训练ECG基础模型ECGFounder，生成超过2000万个标准化10秒ECG片段以增强对生化相关性的敏感性。

Result: 内部验证显示，模型对33个实验室指标具有强预测性能(AUC>0.65)，59个指标中等性能(0.55-0.65)，16个指标性能有限(<0.55)。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了高效的人工智能驱动解决方案，确立了实时、非侵入性实验室值估计的可行性范围。

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

Motivation: 人类类比推理受限于领域专业知识和表面偏见，难以发现跨领域的深层结构类比。LLMs凭借跨领域数据训练，有望成为科学类比推理的未充分探索工具。

Method: 使用LLMs：(1)检索跨领域类比和类比引导的范例，超越传统掺杂替代；(2)从少量标注样本构建领域内类比模板，指导针对性探索。

Result: 这些明确的类比推理策略产生了既定成分空间之外的候选材料，并优于标准提示基线方法。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为可解释的、专家级的假设生成器，利用类比驱动的泛化能力推动科学创新。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决节点状态追踪中查询成本与预测准确性之间的权衡问题，传统方法查询成本高，需要智能决策何时查询。

Method: 使用贪心策略在预测损失低于查询成本时预测，否则查询；在马尔可夫设置下分析最优策略；提出基于投影随机梯度下降的学习算法。

Result: 贪心策略一般次优且竞争比无界，但在常见条件下接近最优；学习算法在未知转移概率时能实现良好的预测-查询权衡。

Conclusion: 贪心策略在特定条件下有效，提出的学习算法在未知环境中具有计算效率和良好性能。

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了稀疏自编码器(SAE)和原始前馈层(FF)在特征可解释性方面的表现，发现两者在可解释性范围上相似，SAE在某些方面有微小改进，但在某些方面FF甚至表现更好，质疑了SAE相对于直接解释FF特征向量的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型可解释性研究主要依赖代理模块进行特征发现，但缺乏系统比较这些学习特征是否比原始模型参数中的特征具有更好特性。

Method: 重新审视前馈层作为键值记忆的特征向量可解释性，使用现代可解释性基准进行广泛评估，比较SAE和FF的特征质量。

Result: SAE和FF表现出相似的可解释性范围，SAE在某些方面有可观察但微小的改进，但在某些方面FF甚至比SAE具有更好的可解释性，且两者发现的特征存在分歧。

Conclusion: 对SAE在特征质量和忠实性方面的优势提出质疑，建议FF键值参数应作为现代可解释性研究的强基线。

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

Motivation: 现有模型发现方法在不确定性量化方面存在局限：需要材料参数先验选择、仅限于模型库的线性系数或推断参数概率分布灵活性不足

Method: 四步框架：1) 用高斯过程增强应力-变形数据；2) 用归一化流近似参数分布；3) 通过匹配参数诱导的应力-变形函数分布与高斯过程后验来精炼参数分布；4) 进行Sobol'敏感性分析以获得稀疏可解释模型

Result: 框架在各项同性和各向异性实验数据以及线性和非线性模型库中均表现出良好能力

Conclusion: 该框架解决了现有方法在不确定性量化方面的关键限制，为非线性本构模型发现提供了更灵活和准确的解决方案

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

TL;DR: 提出Concept Walk框架，通过激活空间投影追踪模型在推理过程中对概念方向内部态度的演变，以评估思维链的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链追踪方法不能真实反映模型内部计算，可能导致从业者误将装饰性推理视为真实推理，需要更可靠的方法来监督推理过程。

Method: 在激活空间中操作，将每个推理步骤投影到从对比数据学习到的概念方向上，观察推理痕迹是否真正影响结果或被丢弃。

Result: 在简单案例中，被扰乱的思维链被快速忽略（装饰性推理）；在复杂案例中，扰动会引起内部激活的持续变化（真实推理）。

Conclusion: Concept Walk提供了通过概念特定内部动态重新检验思维链真实性的方法，帮助识别何时可以信任推理痕迹，何时可能误导从业者。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,

critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our

Motivation: LLM遗忘旨在以低成本让模型忘记危险/不需要的知识，同时尽可能保持模型效用。现有梯度上升方法存在严重不稳定性，导致模型效用急剧下降。

Method: SGA将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据通过可调平滑率结合，从仅学习遗忘数据扩展到同时学习遗忘和正常数据，实现更稳定的遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试中，SGA在所有指标上均优于原始GA方法，并在多个关键指标上达到所有基线方法的前2名性能。

Conclusion: SGA通过平滑梯度上升有效解决了LLM遗忘中的不稳定性问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现了更好的遗忘效果。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

Conclusion: 基于生命游戏的动态单元失活是有效的正则化替代方案，适用于深层架构并能增强不同dropout技术的性能

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

Method: 在回放式持续学习框架中引入外部知识库进行数据增强，评估了多种整合策略。

Result: 增强方法在三个异常行为分类数据集上优于基线回放方法。

Conclusion: 外部知识增强能有效提升回放式持续学习性能，克服缓冲区大小限制。

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

*Amin Omidvar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SmartMixed是一种两阶段训练策略，允许网络学习每个神经元的最优激活函数，同时保持推理时的计算效率。第一阶段神经元从候选池中自适应选择激活函数，第二阶段固定选择结果支持高效向量化操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数神经网络架构仍使用固定统一的激活函数，限制了网络表达能力。需要一种方法让网络能学习每个神经元的最优激活函数，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段使用可微分硬混合机制让神经元从候选激活函数池（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh、Leaky ReLU、ELU、SELU）中自适应选择；第二阶段固定每个神经元的激活函数，支持高效向量化操作。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上评估不同深度的前馈神经网络，发现不同层的神经元对激活函数有不同偏好，揭示了神经网络架构内的功能多样性。

Conclusion: SmartMixed策略成功实现了神经元级别的激活函数自适应选择，在保持计算效率的同时提升了网络表达能力，为理解神经网络内部功能多样性提供了新视角。

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了首个面向图拓扑的提示框架GraphTOP，通过边重连问题在多跳局部子图中修改图拓扑来适配预训练的GNN模型，在多个节点分类数据集上优于六个基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图提示方法主要关注特征导向的方法，在节点特征或隐藏表示上应用图提示，但往往性能不佳，因为它们忽视了拓扑导向提示的潜力。

Method: 将拓扑导向提示重新表述为多跳局部子图中的边重连问题，并通过重参数化将其松弛到连续概率空间，同时确保紧密松弛和保持图稀疏性。

Result: 在五个图数据集和四种预训练策略下的大量实验表明，GraphTOP在多个节点分类数据集上优于六个基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphTOP是首个面向图拓扑的提示框架，能有效适配预训练的GNN模型用于下游任务，证明了拓扑导向提示的重要性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GradLite是一种内存高效的优化器，通过放松对精确梯度的要求，在丢弃或近似中间激活时仍能高效训练，减少50%内存消耗且性能不降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器需要精确梯度，导致大语言模型全微调内存消耗巨大。现有方案要么修改架构，要么牺牲计算换内存，但优化器本身未被改进。

Method: 采用低秩雅可比近似降低反向传播误差信号维度，结合误差反馈校正累积补偿近似误差，保持收敛保证。

Result: 理论分析显示GradLite保持无偏梯度估计和有界方差，实证减少50%优化器状态和激活内存，在推理、多语言和对话基准上性能相当或优于基线。

Conclusion: GradLite通过优化器层面的创新，在不改变架构的情况下显著降低内存需求，为大语言模型高效微调提供了新方案。

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

Motivation: 解决在大规模图语料库中检索包含给定查询子图的图时，现有基于多向量图表示的方法需要穷举评分语料图，效率受限的问题。

Method: 使用上下文密集图表示，通过可微分离散化模块计算学习潜在词汇表上的稀疏二进制码，将图表示为类似文本文档的形式，利用优化的倒排索引，并引入可训练的影响权重和令牌扩展技术。

Result: 实验表明CORGII在准确性和效率之间提供了比多个基线方法更好的权衡。

Conclusion: CORGII是第一个使用离散令牌映射到高效倒排列表的密集图表示索引器，为图检索任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

TL;DR: LAMP是一个数据高效的3D生成框架，通过线性仿射混合参数化形状实现可控和可解释的3D几何生成，支持插值、外推和物理性能优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量训练数据，在可控性和泛化性方面存在局限，需要开发数据高效且可控的3D生成方法。

Method: 首先通过共享初始化过拟合每个样本对齐SDF解码器，然后在对齐权重空间中求解参数约束的混合问题，并通过线性度不匹配检测几何有效性。

Result: LAMP在DrivAerNet++和BlendedNet基准测试中，仅需100个样本即可实现边界内可控插值，支持超出训练范围100%参数差异的安全外推，并能进行物理性能优化。

Conclusion: LAMP在可控性、数据效率和安全性方面显著优于条件自编码器和深度网络插值基线，推动了设计探索、数据集生成和性能驱动优化的3D生成技术。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用人类专家提供的互补标签（弱信号）来评估和训练前沿AI系统的可扩展监督框架，无需真实标签即可估计模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在复杂任务上超越人类专家，获取高质量人类监督变得困难。人类专家通常只在狭窄领域有专业知识，无法评估AI在超人类任务上的表现，但可以提供互补标签（指出错误选项）

Method: 从互补标签推导出无偏的top-1准确率估计器，量化需要多少互补标签才能匹配普通标签的方差。引入两种估计器来结合稀缺的普通标签和丰富的互补标签，并提供有限样本偏差保证

Result: 实证表明无需真实标签即可评估大语言模型的输出，仅需互补标签。还能训练AI系统在分区人类监督下表现更好

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的监督框架，利用人类专家的窄域知识作为弱信号来评估和训练前沿AI系统，解决了高质量人类监督稀缺的问题

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散在连续域（如图像生成）表现出色，但在离散数据上表现不如纯离散方法，这种差距令人困惑。作者旨在理解这一现象的根本原因。

Method: 提出了token可识别性分析框架，识别出高斯噪声通过离散身份损坏和连续秩降级两种机制影响离散数据。开发了CANDI混合框架，将离散和连续损坏解耦，同时学习条件结构和连续几何。

Result: 实证验证了时间不协调现象，并证明CANDI成功避免了这一问题。在控制生成中，CANDI通过简单梯度加法实现基于分类器的引导；在文本生成中，CANDI在低NFE下优于掩码扩散。

Conclusion: CANDI解锁了连续扩散在离散空间中的优势，展示了学习连续梯度对离散空间的价值，为离散数据生成提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线目标条件强化学习中传统方法（如TD和蒙特卡洛）存在的偏差累积和高方差问题，特别是在处理长轨迹任务时的挑战。

Method: 将GCRL中的三角不等式结构转化为实用的分治值更新规则，通过分治策略减少递归次数（O(log T) vs O(T)），同时利用动态编程降低方差。

Result: 在极具挑战性的长视野基准任务中，TRL相比之前的离线GCRL算法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: TRL算法通过分治范式有效解决了离线GCRL中的偏差累积和高方差问题，在长轨迹任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

Motivation: 现实世界的有符号图存在噪声，现有SGNNs缺乏理论指导的鲁棒性研究，需要同时处理输入空间和目标空间的噪声问题。

Method: 扩展图信息瓶颈理论，使其具备目标空间去噪能力；通过重参数化机制和变分近似构建可处理的目标函数，联合清理输入数据与监督目标。

Conclusion: RIDGE框架通过理论指导的联合去噪方法，有效提升了有符号图神经网络的鲁棒性，为噪声环境下的图表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

Motivation: 现有混合整数优化方法只能处理小规模数据集，限制了约束聚类的实用性

Method: 将must-link样本折叠为质心伪样本，通过几何规则剪枝cannot-link，结合分组样本拉格朗日分解和几何消除规则

Result: 能处理20万样本的cannot-link约束和150万样本的must-link约束，比现有方法规模扩大200-1500倍，最优性差距小于3%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了确定性全局保证，避免了现成启发式方法在大数据集上的搜索失败问题

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

Motivation: 随机游走神经网络(RWNNs)在实际采样约束下往往无法捕获图的全局结构，限制了其表达能力，特别是在节点和边覆盖不完整的情况下。

Method: 提出随机搜索神经网络(RSNNs)，该方法基于随机搜索操作，每个搜索保证完整的节点覆盖。理论证明在稀疏图中只需O(log|V|)次搜索即可实现完整边覆盖。

Conclusion: RSNNs为基于随机游走的方法提供了理论和实践上的进步，为稀疏图学习提供了一个高效且表达能力强的框架。

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

Motivation: 传统RLVR方法将包含错误推理模式（如答案猜测、跳跃推理）的rollouts与完全正确的rollouts同等奖励，导致模型学习不可靠的推理模式，限制了推理能力的进一步提升。

Method: 提出FAPO方法：1）使用生成式奖励模型（GenRM）精确检测错误正样本；2）对错误正样本施加参数无关的奖励惩罚；3）在训练初期利用错误推理作为捷径，后期逐步转向可靠推理。

Result: 实验表明FAPO在多个领域有效，提高了结果正确性、过程可靠性和训练稳定性，且不增加计算开销。

Conclusion: FAPO通过区分对待错误正样本，在保持训练效率的同时显著提升了语言模型的推理能力和可靠性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

Result: 实验评估显示该方法达到最先进性能，相比现有方法提升达25%，并在高噪声水平下具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的DDPM方法在随机轨迹恢复任务中表现出色，为处理来自非确定性源的随机日志提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种任意时间在线算法，用于在满足对抗性在线凸约束的同时学习对抗性凸成本函数序列，无需预知时间范围长度即可获得最优性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法需要预知时间范围长度T，或使用性能较差的加倍技巧（需要多次重启），无法在任意中间时间步提供非平凡性能保证。

Method: 使用时间变化的Lyapunov函数来跟踪约束违反，无需标准加倍技巧，通过新的分析技术处理时间变化Lyapunov函数带来的分析挑战。

Result: 算法在任何t≥1时实现O(√t)遗憾和Õ(√t)累积约束违反界，在动态遗憾设置中适应比较器序列的路径长度，在乐观设置中性能随累积预测误差优雅扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需预知时间范围的情况下实现了最优性能，并通过在线最短路径问题的数值实验验证了实用性。

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

Conclusion: 成功将PPI扩展到半监督学习训练过程，提出的动态参数调整方法能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and
interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins
numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

TL;DR: CLEANet是一个针对污染多变量时间序列的鲁棒高效异常检测框架，通过污染弹性训练框架和轻量级共轭MLP解决训练数据污染和模型推理效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多变量时间序列异常检测面临两个关键挑战：训练数据污染（噪声和隐藏异常）导致学习模式失真，以及复杂深度模型过拟合污染数据且推理延迟高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出CLEANet框架，包含污染弹性训练框架（CRTF），通过自适应重构权重策略和聚类引导的对比学习减轻污染样本影响；设计轻量级共轭MLP解耦时间和跨特征依赖关系，避免过拟合并提高计算效率。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上，CLEANet相比十个最先进基线方法，F1分数最高提升73.04%，运行时间降低81.28%；将CRTF集成到三个先进模型中平均获得5.35%的F1增益。

Conclusion: CLEANet有效解决了多变量时间序列异常检测中的数据污染和效率问题，具有很强的泛化能力，为工业系统的可靠性维护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

Conclusion: 受流匹配在生成建模中成功的启发，提出了价值估计的生成范式FlowCritic

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

*Jiaqi Wen,Jianyi Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于扩散模型的分布鲁棒优化方法D-DRO，通过扩散模型构建模糊集，在保持与名义分布一致性的同时捕捉超出名义支持空间的各种对抗分布，实现更好的分布外泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DRO框架需要设计有效的模糊集，既要保持与名义分布的一致性，又要足够多样化以覆盖各种潜在场景，同时需要保证DRO解的可处理性。

Method: 提出扩散基模糊集设计，基于参数化扩散模型空间构建模糊集，然后提出D-DRO算法求解内层最大化问题。

Result: 理论证明了D-DRO的平稳收敛性能，在机器学习预测任务中实证展示了其优越的分布外泛化性能。

Conclusion: 扩散基DRO框架能够有效提升统计学习和优化的鲁棒性与泛化能力，特别是在处理超出名义支持空间的分布时表现优异。

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

*Omar Naim,Krish Sharma,Nicholas Asher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tale是一种推理时算法，通过直接优化任务特定验证性能来修剪整个Transformer层，无需重新训练即可提高准确性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在修剪Transformer层时通常需要重新训练，且不能保证任务性能的提升。Tale旨在无需重新训练的情况下，通过选择性移除层来优化任务性能。

Method: Tale在推理时直接优化任务特定验证性能来修剪整个Transformer层，通过互信息分析识别瓶颈层，并提供用户对准确性和效率权衡的灵活控制。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上的评估显示，Tale在零样本和少样本设置下均能一致提高准确性并减少计算成本，在微调过程中应用还能带来额外性能提升。

Conclusion: Tale通过选择性层移除解决了某些层作为瓶颈的问题，产生了更小、更快、更准确的模型，同时为Transformer可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SeeDNorm动态归一化方法，通过基于当前输入动态调整缩放系数来增强模型表示能力，在保持RMSNorm优点的同时解决了静态缩放因子对输入数据变化适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMSNorm丢弃了输入范数信息，静态缩放因子γ难以适应输入数据和分布变化的广泛变异性，特别是在大语言模型常遇到的零样本场景中限制了性能提升。

Method: SeeDNorm通过动态调整缩放系数来保留输入范数信息，实现数据依赖的自重缩放动态归一化。在反向传播中保持RMSNorm根据输入范数动态调整梯度的能力，并解决了潜在的不稳定性问题。

Result: 在不同规模的大语言模型预训练以及监督和无监督计算机视觉任务中验证了有效性，引入极少参数且对模型效率影响可忽略，性能持续优于RMSNorm、LayerNorm和DyT等归一化方法。

Conclusion: SeeDNorm通过动态缩放机制有效提升了归一化层的表示能力，在各种任务中表现出优越性能，是归一化层的重要改进。

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

TL;DR: NBF-Rec是一种基于图的推荐模型，支持跨数据集的归纳迁移学习，无需重新训练即可在新领域应用，在零样本设置下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于图的推荐系统在归纳设置下的局限性，使其能够适应新用户、新物品或新数据集，而无需重新训练。

Method: 使用动态节点嵌入计算，在推理时生成节点表示，支持跨数据集的交互级消息传递，无需对齐用户或物品。

Result: 在七个真实世界数据集上评估，NBF-Rec在零样本设置下达到竞争性性能，通过轻量级微调可进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: 基于图的推荐系统中的归纳迁移学习是可行的，交互级消息传递支持跨数据集泛化，无需对齐用户或物品。

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习依赖显式模型和领域假设，限制了灵活性和可解释性。需要一种更直接、可解释且能保持人类可理解性的机器学习方法。

Method: 使用信息论中的惊奇度（不确定性）来量化相关性，构建无模型框架，直接对原始数据进行推理，支持数据直接更新操作。

Result: 在生成推理、因果发现、异常检测和时间序列预测等任务中达到或接近最先进性能，能有效处理复杂数据类型包括缺失数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展机器学习和人工智能提供了神经网络之外的可行替代路径，同时保持了底层机制的人类可理解性，建立了信息的'物理学'基础。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于分布式多智能体多臂老虎机问题的算法，该问题具有异构奖励和随机通信图。算法结合了臂消除策略和随机gossip算法，实现了对数级别的遗憾上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布式多智能体环境下的多臂老虎机问题，其中智能体通过随机通信图进行交互，且每个智能体对同一臂的奖励分布可能不同。目标是设计高效的分布式算法来最小化相对于全局平均奖励的累积遗憾。

Method: 提出了一种完全分布式算法，将臂消除策略与随机gossip算法相结合。算法在时变随机通信图上运行，该图通过在固定连通基础图上应用Erdős-Rényi模型生成。

Result: 理论分析表明遗憾上界为O(log T)，包含集中式最优遗憾项和反映通信效率影响的额外项。该额外项与代数连通性λ_{N-1}(Lap(G))和链路概率p相关，揭示了通信效率与遗憾之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该算法在分布式多智能体多臂老虎机问题上实现了对数遗憾，并通过理论分析和数值实验验证了其优越性和理论结果的正确性。通信图的结构特性对算法性能有重要影响。

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成LOESS分解、ARIMA建模和多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络的混合预测框架，用于印度大城市的空气质量指数预测，在多个污染物上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度大城市空气质量问题严重，污染物水平突然飙升挑战及时干预，现有AQI预测方法难以同时处理线性趋势、季节变化和非线性波动模式。

Method: 使用LOESS分解将AQI序列分离为趋势、季节和残差分量，ARIMA建模平滑分量，提出的深度学习模块捕捉残差中的多尺度波动，通过UAMMO优化器调优超参数。

Result: 在2021-2023年中央污染控制委员会数据集上的实验显示，该方法在PM2.5、O3、CO和NOx等污染物上均优于统计、深度学习和混合基线方法，MSE降低5-8%，R²分数>0.94。

Conclusion: 该框架具有鲁棒性，对突发污染事件敏感，适用于城市空气质量管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

TL;DR: 本文分析了BOBW FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的最后迭代收敛性，证明了使用1/2-Tsallis-INF正则化器时，最优臂与算法输出分布之间的Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}速率衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习算法的最后迭代收敛性对机器学习理论很重要，但在多臂赌博机中，现有分析主要关注遗憾界，最后迭代收敛速率研究较少，特别是广泛使用的FTRL算法。对数遗憾直觉上应对应t^{-1}收敛速率，但这一直觉尚未被证实。

Method: 使用与BOBW FTRL算法1/2-Tsallis-INF相关的正则函数Ψ(p)=-4∑√p_i，分析最优臂点质量与算法在迭代t时获得的臂集概率分布之间的Bregman散度衰减速率。

Result: 理论分析表明，Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减，这比直觉预期的t^{-1}速率要慢。

Conclusion: 本文部分证实了对数遗憾与收敛速率之间的直觉联系，但发现实际收敛速率(t^{-1/2})比预期(t^{-1})更慢，为FTRL算法的最后迭代收敛性分析提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

Motivation: 结合GAN的不可区分性与逻辑推理的可解释性，在有限计算预算下实现逻辑约束的生成，提供可解释的失败原因和可控的生成质量。

Method: 使用深度k的Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé博弈框架，判别器作为对手寻找逻辑错误，生成器作为建造者产生能通过k轮匹配验证的样本，结合逻辑损失函数进行训练。

Conclusion: LOGAN提供了一种紧凑、可复现的逻辑约束生成方法，具有可解释的失败机制、经过验证的有效性（仿真和真实训练）以及可控参数。

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

Conclusion: 该方法通过输入空间引导确保去噪轨迹忠实于原始数据结构，提供自适应噪声处理、不确定性量化和可泛化去噪三大优势，显著改善了单细胞数据的聚类性能。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自诱导随机共振(SISR)是慢-快可激发系统中仅由噪声驱动产生的相干振荡现象。传统方法需要大量计算，而纯数据驱动方法缺乏物理可解释性和泛化能力。

Method: 将随机微分方程和SISR渐近时间尺度匹配约束嵌入到基于噪声增强状态预测器的PINN中，复合损失函数整合了数据保真度、动力学残差和基于Kramers逃逸理论的物理约束。

Result: 训练后的PINN准确预测了脉冲序列相干性对噪声强度、兴奋性和时间尺度分离的依赖性，与直接随机模拟结果匹配，相比纯数据驱动方法在精度和泛化能力上有显著提升，同时计算量大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性提供了一个数据高效且可解释的替代模型。

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构有效加速了离散扩散模型的推理，同时保持了生成质量

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

Abstract: Precipitation prediction has undergone a profound transformation -- from
early symbolic and empirical methods rooted in divination and observation, to
modern technologies based on atmospheric physics and artificial intelligence.
This review traces the historical and technological evolution of precipitation
forecasting, presenting a survey about end-to-end precipitation prediction
technologies that spans ancient practices, the foundations of meteorological
science, the rise of numerical weather prediction (NWP), and the emergence of
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. We first explore
traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development
of physical modeling and statistical frameworks that underpin contemporary
operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the
history of end-to-end precipitation prediction but also outlines future
directions in next generation forecasting systems.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLPD-GX是一种混合离线-在线强化学习框架，通过解耦策略优化与安全执行来解决分布偏移问题。奖励寻求的学习器自由探索，而基于投影的守护器保证规则一致执行和安全值备份，实现稳健的O2O RL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合离线-在线强化学习(O2O RL)结合了样本效率和鲁棒探索的优势，但由于离线与在线数据之间的分布偏移而存在不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出RLPD-GX框架，将策略优化与安全执行解耦：奖励寻求的学习器自由探索，基于投影的守护器保证规则一致执行和安全值备份。采用动态课程学习，逐步扩展时间视野并退火离线-在线数据混合。

Result: 在Atari-100k上达到3.02的标准化平均分数，比现有混合方法提升45%，具有更强的安全性和稳定性。在其他安全关键和长视野任务上也表现出一致优势。

Conclusion: 解耦的安全执行为稳健的O2O RL提供了一条简单而有原则的路径，为强化学习中探索与安全的协调提供了更广泛的范式。

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态时间规整和CNN-GRU的深度学习框架，用于实现伊斯法罕市PM2.5的长期稳定预测，在稀疏监测网络下达到10天预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在48小时后PM2.5预测稳定性不足，特别是在监测网络稀疏的城市中，无法满足公共卫生预警系统的长期预测需求。

Method: 结合动态时间规整进行智能站点相似性选择，使用轻量级CNN-GRU架构增强气象特征，优化稀疏网络的可扩展设计。

Result: 在8个监测站多年小时数据上验证，24小时预测R2=0.91，首次实现稳定10天预测（240小时R2=0.73），性能无退化。

Conclusion: 该框架计算效率高且不依赖外部工具，特别适合资源受限的城市环境部署，解决了关键预警系统需求。

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

TL;DR: 该研究测试了基于基础模型的生成式预训练在医疗数据上的表现，发现虽然能复现特征分布，但无法保持临床相关性，强调了领域特定评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来一些研究将基础模型的表示重新用于表型发现，但缺乏严格验证，可能导致表面真实但临床不连贯的嵌入。本研究旨在测试这种不匹配。

Method: 在HIV抗逆转录病毒治疗和急性低血压数据集上训练了两个自回归模型（序列到序列LSTM和简化Transformer），训练时添加受控的不规则性，测试序列保持完整，通过患者轨迹合成评估分布和相关性保真度。

Result: 两个模型都能复现特征分布，但无法保持跨特征结构，表明生成式预训练产生局部真实性但临床连贯性有限。

Conclusion: 结果强调了领域特定评估的必要性，并支持将轨迹合成作为微调或部署前的实用探针。

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习框架，通过可学习的客户端嵌入控制来解决多模态联邦学习中数据不完整和异构导致的特征表示不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多模态联邦学习经常遇到客户端数据不完整和异构的问题，导致局部特征表示不对齐，限制了模型聚合的效果。现有方法要么假设不同模态集但没有缺失特征，要么假设共享模态集但有缺失特征，而本文考虑更一般和现实的设置。

Method: 提出基于可学习客户端嵌入控制的局部自适应表示方法，这些嵌入编码每个客户端的数据缺失模式，作为重新配置信号来对齐全局聚合表示与局部上下文。嵌入控制可以在具有相似数据缺失模式的客户端间进行算法聚合。

Result: 在多个联邦多模态基准测试中，该方法在严重数据不完整情况下实现了高达36.45%的性能提升，并通过理论分析提供了明确的性能边界。

Conclusion: 该方法通过客户端嵌入控制有效解决了多模态联邦学习中的数据不对齐问题，在现实数据缺失场景下表现出显著性能优势。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks
with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under
severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical
analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical
observations. Our source codes are provided at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MMPO方法，通过最大边际似然估计重新构建LLM对齐，无需显式奖励模型和熵最大化，在偏好对齐和保持基础模型能力方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准对齐方法如RLHF复杂且不稳定，需要更简单稳定的替代方案。

Method: 基于最大边际似然估计的偏好优化(MMPO)，最大化偏好文本输出的边际对数似然，使用偏好对作为近似样本。

Result: MMPO在135M到8B参数模型上表现更稳定，实现竞争性或更优的偏好对齐，同时更好地保留基础模型的语言能力。

Conclusion: MMPO通过梯度更新中的隐式偏好优化实现了改进性能，为LLM对齐提供了更简单有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

Abstract: Natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, pose significant challenges to
daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子图匹配在知识图谱问答、分子设计等领域至关重要，现有神经方法虽然有效但设计空间探索不足，需要统一框架来系统研究各种设计选择。

Method: 将现有系统重构为统一的图匹配网络设计空间，探索注意力机制vs软排列交互、节点对齐vs边对齐、最终评分网络形式等关键维度。

Result: 实验表明，在设计空间中精心选择的未探索组合能带来显著的性能提升，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提升了子图匹配性能，还揭示了图表示和交互的通用设计原则，对更广泛的图神经网络研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

Conclusion: 该工作为解释和预测生成模型的方向性偏差提供了新的分析视角，SADs可在训练前预测分数模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard
image benchmarks, we demonstrate that SADs reliably capture fine-grained model
behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法在高维空间中效果有限，需要一种能够处理现实约束（如不可变特征和分类特征）且计算效率高的模型无关方法。

Method: 使用分段采样边界逼近(SSBA)方法，通过二分搜索找到决策边界点，然后搜索最近的可行边界点作为反事实解释。

Result: 在四个不同维度的数据集上，SSBA方法在L2范数距离上比现有方法减少5%到50%，运行效率比基于网格的方法快多个数量级。

Conclusion: SSBA提供了一种简单有效的模型无关方法，能够计算具有现实约束的最接近可行反事实解释。

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Motivation: 现有的掩码扩散语言模型(MDLMs)在少步生成时性能下降，且无法直接应用连续扩散模型的蒸馏方法。统一状态扩散模型(USDMs)虽然缓解了部分限制，但复杂的损失函数阻碍了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 所提出的简化去噪损失和对比启发的负梯度机制有效解决了USDMs的训练复杂性问题，并显著提升了生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

Motivation: 持续学习对LLMs适应知识增长至关重要，但在持续领域预训练场景下缺乏统计可靠性保证。传统共形预测在领域分布变化时无法提供有效保证，且高覆盖率要求下预测集过大。

Method: 使用基于transformer的聚类估计测试集问题分布，重新加权或重采样校准数据，结合自适应拒绝机制让LLM在置信度显著变化时选择弃答。

Result: 大量实验表明该框架在持续领域预训练场景下显著提升了共形预测的有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应拒绝和非交换共形预测框架成功解决了持续领域预训练中LLMs的统计可靠性挑战。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large
language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge
growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to
establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 辅助学习需要人工标注辅助任务，这需要大量人力和领域专业知识。现有元学习方法使用双级优化，但计算成本高且代码复杂。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，RL代理为训练集中的每个数据点选择辅助标签，当选择能提高主任务性能时获得奖励。还实验了学习每个数据点辅助损失权重的最优策略。

Result: 在20-Superclass CIFAR100问题上，RL方法优于人工标注的辅助任务，与主流双级优化技术表现相当。权重学习方法显著超越所有基准，VGG16架构达到80.9%测试准确率。

Conclusion: RL是动态生成辅助任务的可行方法，可以同时学习辅助任务标签和每个样本的权重，并取得优异结果。

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

### [458] [Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin for Climate-Driven Urban Resilience and Equity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22941)
*Zhenglai Shen,Hongyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种灾害响应数字孪生（H-RDT）系统，结合物理信息神经网络、多模态数据融合和公平风险分析，用于城市级灾害响应。在模拟的野火-停电-热浪复合灾害场景中，系统能维持稳定的室内温度预测，并通过强化学习自适应调整数据源权重，识别高脆弱性区域。干预措施可降低热风险7-17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合气候灾害（如野火引发的停电和城市热浪）挑战城市稳定性和公平性，需要开发能够整合物理灾害建模与社会公平的决策支持系统。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络建模、多模态数据融合（IoT、无人机、卫星）和公平风险分析，结合强化学习自适应调整数据源权重，在合成城区进行模拟测试。

Result: 在部分传感器失效情况下，H-RDT能维持稳定的室内温度预测（约31-33°C），识别高脆弱性集群。干预措施使人口加权热风险降低11-13%，尾部风险降低7-17%，过热时间减少达9%。

Conclusion: H-RDT为城市数字韧性建立了可转移的基础框架，将物理灾害建模与社会公平、决策智能相结合，推进了适应性、基于学习的公平中心决策支持系统的发展。

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for
urban-scale response. In a synthetic district with diverse building archetypes
and populations, a simulated wildfire-outage-heatwave cascade shows that H-RDT
maintains stable indoor temperature predictions (approximately 31 to 33 C)
under partial sensor loss, reproducing outage-driven surges and recovery. The
reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过汉克尔奇异值正则化来压缩状态空间模型的方法，使得训练后的模型可压缩性提升10倍，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于状态空间模型的深度神经网络在长序列任务中表现良好，但训练后压缩困难。为了解决这一挑战，研究者探索了通过正则化汉克尔奇异值来获得可压缩模型的方法。

Method: 开发了一种算法，在训练迭代期间高效计算汉克尔奇异值，利用了状态空间模型参数化中系统矩阵的特定块对角结构。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，正则化后的状态空间层比标准状态空间层可压缩性提升高达10倍，同时保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 汉克尔奇异值正则化是压缩状态空间模型的有效方法，能够显著提高模型的可压缩性而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA)方法，将流形几何融入对齐任务，比传统的CKA方法更稳健


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的中心核对齐(CKA)方法不考虑底层流形结构，依赖大量启发式方法，在不同数据规模下表现不一致

Method: 提出MKA方法，将流形几何纳入核对齐任务，建立了理论框架，并在合成数据集和真实世界示例上进行了实证评估

Result: 流形感知的核对齐为衡量表示提供了更稳健的基础，在表示学习中具有潜在应用价值

Conclusion: MKA方法比传统CKA方法更稳健，能够更好地处理不同规模的数据，为表示比较提供了更可靠的基础

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

*Junhao Fan,Wenrui Liang,Wei-Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARNet是一个基于现代时序卷积网络的剩余使用寿命预测框架，通过尖峰感知检测提供物理可解释性，在多个基准数据集上实现了较低的预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多RUL预测模型在故障起始阶段表现脆弱且缺乏可解释性：短时高能尖峰被平滑或误读，固定阈值降低了灵敏度，缺乏基于物理解释的方法。

Method: 基于ModernTCN预测退化敏感指标，采用自适应连续阈值验证真实尖峰并抑制噪声，对故障易发段进行针对性特征工程，最后使用堆叠RF-LGBM回归器生成最终RUL预测。

Result: 在事件触发协议下的基准数据集上，SARNet相比近期基线模型持续降低误差（RMSE 0.0365，MAE 0.0204），同时保持轻量、鲁棒且易于部署。

Conclusion: SARNet通过尖峰感知检测和物理信息可解释性，有效解决了RUL预测中尖峰处理不准确和模型透明度不足的问题，实现了高精度且可解释的剩余寿命预测。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across
benchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet
consistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE
0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文发现增强大语言模型的推理能力会系统性地增加工具幻觉，揭示了推理增强与工具幻觉之间的因果关系和可靠性-能力权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究观察到推理能力增强往往伴随着幻觉增加，但缺乏对推理增强是否直接导致工具幻觉的系统性研究。

Method: 构建SimpleToolHalluBench诊断基准，通过控制实验研究推理增强对工具幻觉的影响，并评估缓解策略。

Result: 实验表明：1）推理增强与工具幻觉存在因果关系；2）该效应超越过拟合；3）方法无关；4）缓解策略存在可靠性-能力权衡。

Conclusion: 当前推理增强方法固有地放大了工具幻觉，需要开发同时优化能力和可靠性的新训练目标。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了谱梯度下降(SpecGD)等谱感知矩阵值优化器在深度学习中的泛化特性，特别是在数据不平衡情况下相比传统欧几里得梯度下降(GD)的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Muon和Shampoo等谱感知矩阵值优化器在深度学习中的广泛采用，需要系统研究它们的泛化特性，特别是何时能超越竞争算法。

Method: 使用不平衡数据作为测试平台，研究谱梯度下降(SpecGD)的规范形式，并在高斯混合数据模型和线性/双线性模型中量化分析SpecGD与GD的性能差异。

Result: 研究发现SpecGD能平等学习数据的所有主成分，而GD优先学习主导主成分。这导致SpecGD在训练早期获得更好的平衡准确率，且深度会放大这种效应。

Conclusion: 谱优化器通过促进数据基础组件的更平衡学习，实现了优越的泛化性能，这一发现在多种不平衡数据集上得到验证。

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

TL;DR: 提出QoSMGAA架构，通过多阶注意力机制和对抗神经网络提升QoS预测精度，在数据稀疏和噪声环境下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络服务数量激增导致相似服务选择困难，现有QoS预测方法在捕捉上下文信息和处理数据稀疏、结构噪声方面表现不佳。

Method: 集成多阶注意力机制聚合上下文数据，使用对抗神经网络进行自回归监督学习，采用Gumbel-Softmax离散采样技术生成负样本。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验验证表明，该模型显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: QoSMGAA在复杂噪声网络服务环境中具有实际部署潜力，适用于服务选择和推荐场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technologies, network services have
become critical for delivering diverse and reliable applications to users.
However, the exponential growth in the number of available services has
resulted in many similar offerings, posing significant challenges in selecting
optimal services. Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a
fundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
However, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual
information and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and
structural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,
specifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy
network service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention
mechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values
effectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks
to perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction
matrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and
services, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax
method to generate informative negative samples. Comprehensive experimental
validation conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that our
proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods,
highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in service selection
and recommendation scenarios.

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

Motivation: 研究语言模型在上下文示例中组合基本技能以完成复合任务的能力，这比标准设置更具挑战性，因为技能及其组合需要在训练中学习。

Method: 对多个代表性开源语言模型进行系统实验，使用语言和逻辑任务来探索组合能力，并通过理论分析验证结果。

Result: 实验结果显示简单任务示例可能对性能产生负面影响，模型普遍难以正确识别和组装技能，即使使用思维链示例也是如此。

Conclusion: 理论分析表明，将示例与组合中的相应步骤对齐至关重要，这为改进探测任务的方法提供了积极支持。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

TL;DR: 本文证明了softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数(p≥1)下具有1/2的Lipschitz常数，而非传统认为的1，这一更尖锐的常数直接改进了现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型和优化算法的鲁棒性保证及收敛性分析通常假设softmax算子的Lipschitz常数为1，但这一假设可能不够精确，限制了理论分析的紧密度。

Method: 通过理论分析证明softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数(p≥1)下具有1/2的Lipschitz常数，并在p=1和p=∞时达到该常数，对于p∈(1,∞)则严格小于1/2。

Result: 证明了softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数下具有1/2的Lipschitz常数，这是首个全面的范数统一分析。该更尖锐的常数直接改进了现有鲁棒性和收敛性理论结果。

Conclusion: softmax函数具有比传统认知更小的Lipschitz常数1/2，这一发现为机器学习模型的鲁棒性分析和优化算法的收敛性分析提供了更精确的理论基础。

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and
on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在元学习框架下学习关系元知识时存在两个关键问题：一是孤立学习关系元知识，未能捕捉跨任务共享的通用关系模式；二是难以有效整合对快速适应至关重要的局部任务特定上下文。

Method: 提出MoEMeta框架，包含两个关键创新：(1) 混合专家(MoE)模型学习全局共享关系原型以增强泛化；(2) 任务定制适应机制捕捉局部上下文以实现快速任务特定适应。

Result: 在三个知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验和分析表明，MoEMeta始终优于现有基线方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过平衡全局泛化与局部适应能力，MoEMeta显著推进了少样本关系学习的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Sentinel通过个性化联邦学习框架有效解决了物联网入侵检测中的数据挑战，实现了隐私保护、通信效率和性能提升的平衡。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

Result: ANN算法需要O(n^{1+ρ-η})内存，仅存储总输入的n^{-η}比例；A-KDE草图大小为O(RW·(1/(√(1+ε)-1))·log²N)，这是滑动窗口模型中首个理论亚线性草图保证

Conclusion: 提出的草图算法在理论和实践中都表现出色，实现了轻量级和低误差的性能

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

TL;DR: CrysLLMGen是一个结合大语言模型和扩散模型的混合框架，用于生成周期性晶体结构，在结构有效性、组成有效性、稳定性和新颖性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：大语言模型擅长处理离散原子类型但难以处理连续特征（如原子位置和晶格参数），而扩散模型擅长建模连续变量但难以生成准确的原子组成。需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出CrysLLMGen混合框架：首先使用微调的大语言模型生成原子类型、原子坐标和晶格结构的中间表示，然后保留预测的原子类型，将原子坐标和晶格结构传递给预训练的等变扩散模型进行细化。

Result: 在多个基准任务和数据集上优于最先进的生成模型，在结构和组成有效性方面实现平衡性能，生成的材料比基于LLM和去噪的模型更稳定和新颖，并展示出强大的条件生成能力。

Conclusion: CrysLLMGen成功结合了LLM和扩散模型的互补优势，为晶体材料生成提供了有效的解决方案，能够生成满足用户定义约束的材料。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in
designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely
on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

TL;DR: 本文揭示了两种看似不同的Pass@K目标策略梯度优化方法（直接REINFORCE和优势塑造技术）实际上是同一枚硬币的两面，通过逆向工程和正向推导建立了它们之间的等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和两种看似不同的Pass@K目标策略梯度优化方法，揭示它们的内在联系，为RLVR策略梯度优化提供更广泛的视角。

Method: 通过逆向工程分析现有优势塑造算法，揭示其隐含优化代理奖励的本质；同时从代理奖励目标出发，提供推导优势塑造方法的简单方法。

Result: 证明了直接REINFORCE方法和优势塑造技术是等价的，将GRPO的硬样本加权修改解释为奖励级正则化，并提供了推导新优势塑造方法的通用方法。

Conclusion: 这种视角为超越Pass@K原始动机的RLVR策略梯度优化提供了新的理解框架，统一了两种看似不同的方法。

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Conclusion: AirFed在大规模无人机-移动边缘计算部署中展现出强大的可扩展性和实际适用性，能够有效应对动态环境中的协调挑战。

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

Motivation: 在离散状态空间中从未归一化密度中采样是一个具有挑战性的问题，传统方法通常需要目标分布样本或计算配分函数。TCSIS旨在克服这些限制，提供更有效的采样方法。

Method: 构建前向连续时间马尔可夫链，使用均匀噪声核。提出目标具体分数恒等式，将具体分数与玻尔兹曼因子期望值联系起来。用神经网络近似具体分数，开发了自归一化和无偏两种TCSIS算法。

Conclusion: TCSIS为离散状态空间中的采样问题提供了一种新颖有效的解决方案，通过利用连续时间马尔可夫链的反向动力学和具体分数恒等式，克服了传统方法的限制。

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

TL;DR: 神经网络算子仅使用低精度求解器数据训练，却能超越训练数据的精度限制，在多次推演中达到比训练数据更高的精度，这种现象称为"模拟器优越性"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点：基于数值求解器数据训练的神经网络算子被认为受限于训练数据的精度。本文旨在证明神经网络可以突破这种限制。

Method: 通过理论分析揭示归纳偏置、训练目标和数值误差特性之间的相互作用，并在多种PDE上使用标准神经网络架构进行实证验证。

Result: 实证表明，模拟器能够隐式学习比训练数据更正则化的动力学，具有更有利的误差累积特性，从而在特定操作机制下超越训练数据的物理保真度。

Conclusion: 这项工作促使重新评估模拟器基准测试，表明神经模拟器可能在特定操作机制下获得比其训练源更高的物理保真度。

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Conclusion: PINNs即使在有限数据下也能提供可靠的结构重量估计，有助于轻量桥梁设计的早期失效分析。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

Conclusion: 该方法在不同领域都能有效检测异常数据，具有低假阳性率和高可靠性。

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

Motivation: 为GSPO算法提供信息论解释，帮助理解其经验性质如方差减少和训练稳定性。

Method: 建立GSPO序列级权重与困惑度比率、交叉熵变化之间的数学等价关系，并通过数学推理任务进行实验验证。

Result: 证明GSPO的权重可等价表示为困惑度比率和指数交叉熵变化，验证了方差预测和数学等价性。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为理解GSPO算法提供了新的理论框架，解释了其经验优势如几何平均带来的对数域方差减少和专家混合模型训练的稳定性。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 传统架构将感知与决策分离，导致策略失败无法直接帮助感知模块学习重要特征，这种分离效率低下。

Result: 在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中评估，该方法实现了更稳定的奖励和更强的对齐效果，优于标准PPO基线。

Conclusion: 交错Transformer编码器是开发更集成自主代理的有前景方向。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了低延迟、节能的边缘计算手势识别，适合长期边缘操作部署。

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches
0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit
1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with
slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,
demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了基准分数支持多样化科学主张的条件，将预测性基准测试视为机器学习中概念和理论推理的重要场所。

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续预训练缩放定律通常假设固定的预训练预算，这限制了它们预测在不同tokens-per-parameter下自适应结果的能力。

Method: 开发了PTPP感知的自适应缩放定律，将预训练预算作为显式变量，能够在未见过的PTPP值下准确预测自适应损失。

Conclusion: PTPP感知缩放定律不仅能够预测自适应性能，还能在实际应用中规划回放比率和自适应token预算，在计算限制下满足目标和遗忘约束。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a

*Amal Abed,Ivan Lukic,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展的合成数据生成管道，创建了近80万个包含指令-推理-代码-测试的四元组数据集，用于提升大语言模型的代码生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成数据集大多只包含问题和解决方案，缺乏中间推理过程，限制了模型学习人类思考方式的能力。

Method: 结合四个关键组件：精选竞赛问题、网络挖掘内容、基于推理模式的数据扩展、多阶段执行验证，并使用遗传变异算法增加任务多样性。

Result: 在该数据集上微调的LLM在代码基准测试中表现一致提升，推理感知数据可以替代模型缩放，在相同样本预算下优于领先的开源替代方案。

Conclusion: 以推理为中心的合成数据生成是提升LLM编码能力的高效方法，发布了数据集和生成管道以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that
fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding
benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model
scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source
alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes
reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for
advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation
pipeline to facilitate further research.

*Hong Wang,Jie Wang,Jian Luo,huanshuo dong,Yeqiu Chen,Runmin Jiang,Zhen huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCSF的新方法，通过利用算子间的相似性来加速特征值数据生成，相比传统数值求解器可实现3.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络特征值方法需要大量带标签数据（算子和特征值）进行训练，数据生成成本高昂。现有方法忽视了算子间的相似性这一重要因素。

Method: 使用截断快速傅里叶变换排序将具有相似特征值分布的算子分组，构建切比雪夫子空间滤波器，利用先前已解决问题的特征对来辅助解决后续问题，减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验结果显示，SCSF相比各种数值求解器实现了最高3.5倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: SCSF是首个加速特征值数据生成的方法，通过利用算子相似性显著提高了数据生成效率。

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Grassmann流形上黎曼插值的低通图滤波器插值算法，用于参数化图族中的高效滤波器计算，并应用于演化图拓扑和点积图族。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算参数化图族的低通图滤波器成本过高，需要重复求解特征值问题，因此需要更高效的算法。

Method: 基于Grassmann流形上法坐标的黎曼插值算法，推导子空间插值的误差界估计。

Result: 提出了两种应用：通过相似性校正调整网络同质性的演化图拓扑，以及基于静态图诱导的点积图族以改进节点分类的消息传递方案。

Conclusion: 黎曼插值方法为参数化图族的低通滤波器计算提供了高效解决方案，并展示了在演化图和点积图族中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

*Ning Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了对抗性腐蚀的隐量子马尔可夫模型（AC-HQMM）和鲁棒迭代学习算法（RILA），用于在数据腐蚀情况下稳健学习量子序列模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐量子马尔可夫模型学习算法对数据腐蚀高度敏感，缺乏在对抗性扰动下确保鲁棒性的机制。

Method: 提出AC-HQMM框架，允许控制比例的观测序列被对抗性腐蚀；开发RILA算法，集成基于熵过滤的腐蚀行移除模块和迭代随机重采样过程，使用L1惩罚似然目标增强稳定性。

Result: 在多个HQMM和HMM基准测试中，RILA展现出优越的收敛稳定性、腐蚀恢复能力和物理有效性保持能力。

Conclusion: RILA为鲁棒量子序列学习提供了原则性且高效的方法，优于现有算法。

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GCAO聚类算法，通过群体驱动的引力吸引和优化机制，解决高维非均匀分布数据中低密度边界样本易受干扰的问题，显著提升聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法在处理高维和非均匀分布数据时，低密度边界样本容易被邻近簇干扰，导致聚类结果不稳定和扭曲。

Method: 引入群体级优化机制，将低密度边界点聚合成协作移动的群体，结合局部密度估计和邻域拓扑构建有效的引力相互作用，使用群体作为基本运动单元进行引力收缩。

Result: 在多个高维数据集上优于11种代表性聚类方法，NMI、ARI、Homogeneity和ACC分别平均提升37.13%、52.08%、44.98%和38.81%，同时保持竞争性的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: GCAO在保持簇完整性、增强边界可分性和确保复杂数据分布上的鲁棒性能方面具有优越性。

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

### [490] [Toward Interpretable Evaluation Measures for Time Series Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23261)
*Félix Chavelli,Paul Boniol,Michaël Thomazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的时间序列分割评估指标：WARI（加权调整兰德指数）和SMS（状态匹配分数），以解决现有评估方法在捕捉分割质量方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割评估方法主要关注变化点准确性或使用基于点的度量（如调整兰德指数），这些方法无法捕捉检测到的分割段的质量，忽略了错误的性质，且可解释性有限。

Method: 提出WARI指标考虑分割错误的位置，以及SMS指标作为细粒度度量，能够识别和评分四种基本类型的分割错误，并允许错误特定加权。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试上经验验证表明，WARI和SMS不仅提供了更准确的分割质量评估，还揭示了传统度量无法获取的见解，如错误来源和类型。

Conclusion: 新提出的WARI和SMS评估指标能够更全面、准确地评估时间序列分割性能，提供更好的可解释性和错误分析能力。

Abstract: Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data
across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring.
While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this
problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited.
Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on
point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture
the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer
limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by
introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index),
that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching
Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental
types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We
empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation
quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are
inaccessible with traditional measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAHQ是一种加速自动化电路发现的新方法，通过逐注意力头量化来优化补丁操作效率，在保持分析忠实度的同时显著降低计算时间和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化电路发现方法在大型语言模型中存在计算效率低下和内存需求过高的问题，而现有的加速方法主要依赖线性近似，这会显著损害分析忠实度。

Method: PAHQ利用激活补丁与混合精度量化之间的基本对齐关系，通过逐注意力头量化来优化每个补丁操作的效率，仅对研究组件保持高精度，而在网络其他部分安全降低精度。

Result: PAHQ加速的ACDC相比未加速版本，运行时间减少高达80%，内存消耗降低高达30%，同时保持忠实度。该方法无需训练，可轻松集成到现有的基于边缘的电路发现技术中。

Conclusion: PAHQ提供了一种实用且新颖的途径来加速机制可解释性方法，通过修改注意力计算机制，在保持分析质量的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/626619403/PAHQ.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAMPE是一个统一的多模态蛋白质嵌入框架，通过最优传输对齐和条件图生成融合方法，解决了蛋白质功能预测中的跨模态分布不匹配和噪声图数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合异质的内在信号（序列、结构）和噪声的外在上下文（蛋白质相互作用、GO注释），但存在跨模态分布不匹配和噪声图数据降解GNN聚合效果的问题。

Method: 提出最优传输表示对齐方法建立不同模态嵌入空间的对应关系，以及条件图生成融合方法，通过条件编码器融合对齐的内在嵌入来重建图结构。

Result: 在标准GO基准测试中优于或匹配DPFunc等最先进方法，AUPR提升0.002-0.013pp，Fmax提升0.004-0.007pp。消融研究显示OT对齐贡献0.043-0.064pp AUPR，CGG融合贡献0.005-0.111pp Fmax。

Conclusion: DAMPE提供了一个可扩展且理论基础的鲁棒多模态蛋白质表示学习方法，显著提升了蛋白质功能预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Torsor CNNs框架，用于在具有局部对称性的图上进行学习，通过边势能编码相邻坐标系之间的群值变换，建立了与群同步问题的等价性，并提供了局部等变的卷积层和几何正则化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数等变神经网络依赖于单一全局对称性，这限制了它们在对称性是局部而非全局的领域中的应用。需要一种能够处理局部对称性的框架。

Method: 引入Torsor CNNs框架，使用边势能（群值变换）编码局部对称性，提出Torsor卷积层（局部等变性证明）和frustration损失（几何正则化器），可在任意图上操作，无需全局坐标系或光滑流形结构。

Result: 该框架统一并推广了包括经典CNNs和流形上的Gauge CNNs在内的多种架构，适用于多视角3D识别等任务，其中相对相机姿态自然定义了所需的边势能。

Conclusion: Torsor CNNs为在具有局部对称性的图上学习提供了数学基础和实用框架，扩展了等变神经网络的应用范围。

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials -- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss -- a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures -- including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds
-- by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate
system or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations
of this framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D
recognition, where relative camera poses naturally define the required edge
potentials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的符号回归方法通常只使用单个轨迹来推断动态系统方程，无法充分利用同一系统的多个观测轨迹。MIO旨在通过多实例学习有效利用重复观测，提高动态系统建模的泛化能力。

Method: 结合多实例学习和基于Transformer的符号回归，研究不同的实例聚合策略（如简单平均聚合），在1-4维系统和不同噪声水平下进行验证。

Result: MIO在从1维到4维的各种系统和不同噪声水平下都持续优于现有基线方法，即使简单的平均聚合也能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: MIO通过有效利用多个观测轨迹，显著提升了符号常微分方程推断的性能和泛化能力，为动态系统建模提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a
dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with
transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of
the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation
strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: GRAD作为自动驾驶系统的可靠高效实时异常检测解决方案，在保证车辆安全运行的同时具有最小计算开销。

Abstract: This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for
autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep
learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach
combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts
smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage
Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term
patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决S-LoRA在服务多个LoRA适配器时的通信开销问题，特别是在多设备设置中，现有的分片策略会产生实际应用中较大的通信开销。

Method: 约束LoRA因子为块对角矩阵，从而设计出无需额外通信的LoRA适配器分片方法，与基础模型的张量并行执行良好对齐。

Result: 在8个A100 GPU上，Llama-3.1-70B达到1.79倍端到端加速（使用0.87倍适配器参数），Llama-3.1-8B达到1.63倍端到端加速（使用0.86倍适配器参数），且参数效率与标准LoRA相当。

Conclusion: 块对角LoRA方法在保持参数效率的同时，显著提升了多GPU环境下的推理性能，解决了S-LoRA的通信瓶颈问题。

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可学习Sigmoid算子的乘法更新近端梯度算法（SSO-PGA），用于解决非负逆问题中传统PGA的收敛不稳定和违反非负约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近端梯度算法在图像重建等逆问题中经常违反非负约束，导致收敛不稳定和次优解，其根本原因是梯度下降步骤会引入负值并对超参数高度敏感。

Method: 用可学习的Sigmoid算子替代梯度下降步骤，将传统的减法更新转换为乘法更新，强制实施非负性和有界性；通过滑动参数增强稳定性和收敛性；将优化算法展开为深度网络。

Result: 在数值和真实世界实验中，该方法显著超越了传统PGA和其他最先进算法，确保了优越的性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: SSO-PGA通过乘法更新机制有效解决了非负逆问题中的约束违反问题，同时结合了优化方法的可解释性和深度学习的强大能力。

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

foundation model framework for data-efficient FSM. The approach fine-tunes
Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) with Thinking-in-Modality (TiM) reasoning,
enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1
or Sentinel-2 imagery. Using paired EO and simulated flood maps from data-rich
regions, ZeroFlood bridges data availability gaps through cross-modal
representation learning. Experiments with TerraMind and Prithvi GFMs show that
TiM enhances model robustness, with the TerraMind-Large configuration achieving
an F1 score of 67.21. The results demonstrate the feasibility of
foundation-model-based FSM as a scalable and data-efficient solution for flood
risk management.

TL;DR: GATE是一个通用AI框架，可同时学习34种物理化学性质，通过几何对齐减少多标准筛选中的假阴性，成功应用于数据中心浸没冷却液发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型多为特定问题设计，需要为每个新性质重新收集数据和训练，限制了材料发现的效率。

Method: 开发GATE框架，在共享几何空间中对齐34种跨领域物理化学性质，捕获跨性质相关性，无需问题特定配置即可应用。

Result: 筛选数十亿候选分子，识别92,861个有前景分子，其中4个经实验验证性能与商业冷却液相当或更优。

Conclusion: GATE是一个即用型通用AI平台，可广泛应用于各种材料发现任务。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of
materials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific,
requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a
generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties
spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or
exceeding a commercial coolant. These results establish GATE as a ready-to-use,
generalizable AI platform readily applicable across diverse materials discovery
tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接优化max@k指标的方法，解决了RLVR在数学和编程领域微调过程中可能损害模型探索能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR在单次生成问题解决中表现出色，但强化学习微调过程可能损害模型的探索能力，导致生成多样性下降，从而在大规模N值的最佳N采样中性能退化。

Method: 推导了用于直接优化max@k指标的无偏策略梯度估计，并将其扩展到离策略更新，以提高样本效率。

Result: 实证表明，该方法在离策略场景下有效优化了max@k指标，使模型与最佳N推理策略保持一致。

Conclusion: 提出的目标函数成功解决了RLVR微调中的探索能力退化问题，优化了max@k指标性能。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

Motivation: 现有数据估值方法基于ID损失，无法泛化到OOD场景，且OOD感知方法计算成本高昂，阻碍实际部署

Method: 使用ID数据子集的协方差矩阵特征值比率来谱近似领域差异，通过扰动理论估计每个数据点对该差异的边际贡献，无需额外训练循环

Result: EV在真实数据集上实现了改进的OOD鲁棒性和稳定的价值排序，同时保持计算轻量

Conclusion: EV为具有领域偏移的大规模场景提供了实用的OOD鲁棒数据估值方法

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by
combining learned molecular descriptors from a graph neural network (GNN) with
general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble of machine learning (ML)
models. We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a
diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for
combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular
descriptors.
  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide
set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with
task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

Motivation: 当输入数据集被随机噪声污染时，评估核心集质量变得困难，因为真实的基础数据集无法观测。需要找到可计算的替代误差度量来构建有效核心集。

Method: 分析传统误差度量并引入新的误差度量方法，该方法与真实聚类成本更接近。设计基于新度量的核心集构建算法，在数据和噪声的温和假设下，通过新度量获得更小的核心集和更紧密的保证。

Conclusion: 提出的新误差度量方法在噪声环境下能构建更小的核心集，并提供比传统方法更紧密的聚类成本近似保证，具有理论和实际价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

Conclusion: SNN提供了一个连贯且可处理的框架，将概率预测从点估计提升到基于物理启发的振幅分布表示。

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by
quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the
output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN
departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

Motivation: 利用移动用户的地理信息改进联邦学习，使模型能更好地适应用户在不同地理区域的数据和行为特征。

Method: 将移动设备数据映射到地理区域，每个区域训练一个FL模型；使用层次随机图建模区域间相关性，通过MCMC采样优化；每个训练步骤中，区域融合本地梯度与从HRG采样的其他区域梯度，使用自注意力权重实现概率性梯度共享。

Result: 在6个国家的心率预测数据集上验证，SGFusion训练的模型收敛且有上界期望误差，在所有国家都显著提高了模型效用，且未显著影响系统可扩展性。

Conclusion: SGFusion能显著提高模型效用而不引入过多计算成本，实现了地理区域间的知识融合和共享。

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

Conclusion: ADPrompt框架能有效适应预训练GNN模型并增强公平性，通过双重提示机制解决了图数据中的属性和结构偏见问题。

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

Conclusion: T-REGS是一个简单有效的正则化方法，能同时解决自监督学习中的维度塌缩和分布均匀性问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often consume excessive tokens, inflating

analyzing Blackwell optimality in restricted policy classes, we encourage

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

Result: 在7个标准前向PDE基准测试中，RGA KANs稳定且性能优于参数匹配的cPIKANs和PirateNets，通常提升数个数量级。

Conclusion: RGA KANs成功解决了深度cPIKANs的训练稳定性问题，在PDE求解中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

TL;DR: 提出DFNMF方法，一种端到端的深度非负三因子分解模型，用于公平图聚类，通过单一参数λ平衡公平性与效用性，实现高可扩展性和透明性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平图聚类方法存在约束刚性、多阶段流程等问题，限制了权衡控制、可解释性和可扩展性。

Method: 采用深度非负三因子分解，直接优化聚类分配，使用软统计奇偶正则化器，通过稀疏友好的交替更新实现近线性扩展。

Result: 在合成和真实网络上，DFNMF在保持相似模块性的同时实现显著更高的群体平衡，在帕累托前沿上优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: DFNMF提供了一种有效、可扩展且透明的公平图聚类解决方案，通过单一参数实现公平性与效用的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

Conclusion: 验证了自定义构建系统直接从图像翻译文本的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TAMI框架解决时序图链接预测中的异质性问题，包含对数时间编码函数(LTE)和链接历史聚合(LHA)两个组件，能有效提升现有模型的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序交互中天然存在异质性，如少数节点对产生大部分交互事件、交互间隔时间不均等，导致现有方法在预测不频繁交互节点对的链接时效果不佳。

Method: TAMI框架包含LTE组件（通过对数变换平衡交互间隔时间编码）和LHA组件（防止节点对历史交互被遗忘），可与现有时序图神经网络无缝集成。

Result: 在13个经典数据集和3个最新TGB基准数据集上的实验表明，TAMI在转导和归纳设置下均能持续提升基础模型的链接预测性能。

Conclusion: TAMI通过有效处理时序交互异质性，显著提升了时序图链接预测的性能，特别是对于不频繁交互节点对的预测效果。

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Alleinx/TAMI_temporal_graph.

TL;DR: DPO-PRO：一种基于DPO的鲁棒微调算法，通过轻量级DRO公式处理偏好分布的不确定性，相比现有DPO变体在噪声偏好信号下表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO方法对数据噪声敏感且容易过拟合，现有DRO方法存在过度保守和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出DPO-PRO算法，专注于偏好不确定性，避免不必要的保守性，计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在标准对齐基准和真实公共卫生任务上的实验表明，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体在噪声偏好信号下鲁棒性更好。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调方法，等价于正则化DPO目标，惩罚模型在弱偏好信号下的过度自信。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准掩码扩散模型无法有效捕获并发预测token间的依赖关系，当token间依赖重要时会导致生成质量下降。

Method: 在掩码扩散过程中引入潜变量，通过变分推断来显式建模token间的依赖关系。

Result: 在合成数据集上成功学习到传统掩码扩散无法捕获的依赖关系；在数独谜题和文本数据集上提高了全局一致性；增强了生成质量和依赖感知能力。

Conclusion: 将变分推断集成到掩码扩散中具有重要价值，VMD框架能够有效提升离散生成建模的性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 为电气单端口网络提供一个统一的数学框架，将代数表示与电气实现联系起来，支持自动网络合成和形式验证。

Method: 使用m-词(jorbs)表示网络，通过串并联组合在m-图上诱导m-拓扑，定义θ映射保持单端口等价性，引入λ-Δ度量和估值态射Φ描述阻抗结构，扩展算法程序生成和分类非同构串并联拓扑。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动网络合成、分类和形式验证提供了自洽的理论和计算基础，在Jorbology新兴领域中实现了阻抗函数的符号到拓扑转换。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified algebraic, topological, and logical framework
for electrical one-port networks based on \v{S}are's $m$-theory. Within this
formalism, networks are represented by $m$-words (jorbs) over an ordered
alphabet, where series and parallel composition induce an $m$-topology on
$m$-graphs with a theta mapping $\vartheta$ that preserves one-port
equivalence. The study formalizes quasi-orders, shells, and cores, showing
their structural correspondence to network boundary conditions and impedance
behavior. The $\lambda--\Delta$ metric, together with the valuation morphism
$\Phi$, provides a concise descriptor of the impedance-degree structure. In the
computational domain, the framework is extended with algorithmic procedures for
generating and classifying non-isomorphic series-parallel topologies,
accompanied by programmatic Cauer/Foster synthesis workflows and validation
against canonical examples from Ladenheim's catalogue. The resulting approach
enables symbolic-to-topological translation of impedance functions, offering a
constructive bridge between algebraic representation and electrical
realization. Overall, the paper outlines a self-consistent theoretical and
computational foundation for automated network synthesis, classification, and
formal verification within the emerging field of Jorbology.

Conclusion: 所提出的价格整合扩散模型为研究产品采用和定价决策提供了有效工具，在垄断定价和政策干预分析方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Bass diffusion model in discrete-time that
explicitly models the effect of price in adoption. Our model is different from
earlier price-incorporated models and fits well to adoption data for various
products. We then utilize this model to study two decision-making problems.
First, we provide a series of structural results on optimal pricing strategies
to maximize profits from product sales by a monopolist over a finite horizon.
We fully characterize the optimal pricing strategy in the single-period
problem, and establish several structural properties of the same for the
multi-period counterpart. Second, we study a Stackelberg game between a
policy-maker and a monopolist, where the former seeks to maximize adoption
through rebates, while the latter focuses on profits. For this problem, we
analytically characterize crucial properties of the equilibrium path of the
single-period game, and demonstrate how they carry over to the multi-period
variant.

Abstract: We present an algorithm for planning trajectories that avoid obstacles and
satisfy key-door precedence specifications expressed with a fragment of signal
temporal logic. Our method includes a novel exact convex partitioning of the
obstacle free space that encodes connectivity among convex free space sets, key
sets, and door sets. We then construct an augmented graph of convex sets that
exactly encodes the key-door precedence specifications. By solving a shortest
path problem in this augmented graph of convex sets, our pipeline provides an
exact solution up to a finite parameterization of the trajectory. To illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach, we present a method to generate key-door
mazes that provide challenging problem instances, and we perform numerical
experiments to evaluate the proposed pipeline. Our pipeline is faster by
several orders of magnitude than recent state-of-the art methods that use
general purpose temporal logic tools.

Abstract: Conventional AC Power Flow (ACPF) solvers like Newton-Raphson (NR) face
significant computational and convergence challenges in modern, large-scale
power systems. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid method that
integrates a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a robust,
iterative Linear State Estimation (LSE) refinement step to produce fast and
physically-consistent solutions. The GNN, trained with a physics-informed loss
function featuring an efficient dynamic weighting scheme, rapidly predicts a
high-quality initial system state. This prediction is then refined using an
iterative, direct linear solver inspired by state estimation techniques. This
LSE refinement step solves a series of linear equations to enforce physical
laws, effectively bypassing the non-linearities and convergence issues of
traditional solvers. The proposed GNN-LSE framework is comprehensively
validated on systems ranging from small radial distribution networks (IEEE
33-bus, 69-bus) to a large, meshed transmission system (IEEE 118-bus). Results
show that our GNN variants are up to $8.4 \times 10^3$ times faster than NR.
The LSE refinement provides a fast route to a physically-consistent solution,
while heavy-loading stress tests (120%-150% of nominal) and N-1 contingencies
demonstrate the method's reliability and generalization. This work presents a
powerful and flexible framework for bridging fast, data-driven models with the
rigorous constraints of power system physics, offering a practical tool for
real-time operations and analysis.

Abstract: This paper suggests a novel rotor-cooling shaft concept for high-performance
electric motors that increases the effectiveness of cooling and is yet simple
and cost-effective to manufacture. We investigate the thermal performance of
four shaft geometries for rotor cooling in automotive applications. The
proposed tooth-guided liquid-cooling shaft design aims to solve the high
churning loss of conventional cooled rotor shafts due to internal vortex
formation and their still limited heat transfer. Therefore, we optimize heat
transfer efficiency and pressure management by incorporating cold-formed
internal channels that restrict vortex formation beyond a degree that improves
heat transfer. We evaluated key performance metrics, including heat transfer
rate, outlet temperature, pressure drop, and velocity profiles, under varying
rotational speeds, inlet flow rates, and coolant temperatures. Computational
fluid analysis demonstrates that the tooth-guided design outperforms
conventional hollow shafts and achieves up to 110% higher cooling efficiency at
low rotational speeds, while it maintains comparable pressure levels. These
findings provide practical insight into geometry-driven thermal optimization
and offer a path toward improving the performance and durability of electric
motors.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种数据高效、面向控制的建模方法，适用于需要准确轨迹敏感度预测的动态系统。

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems is crucial across the science and engineering
fields for accurate prediction, control, and decision-making. Recently, machine
learning (ML) approaches, particularly neural ordinary differential equations
(NODEs), have emerged as a powerful tool for data-driven modeling of
continuous-time dynamics. Nevertheless, standard NODEs require a large number
of data samples to remain consistent under varying control inputs, posing
challenges to generate sufficient simulated data and ensure the safety of
control design. To address this gap, we propose trajectory-sensitivity-aware
(TRASE-)NODEs, which construct an augmented system for both state and
sensitivity, enabling simultaneous learning of their dynamics. This formulation
allows the adjoint method to update gradients in a memory-efficient manner and
ensures that control-input effects are captured in the learned dynamics. We
evaluate TRASE-NODEs using damped oscillator and inverter-based resources
(IBRs). The results show that TRASE-NODEs generalize better from the limited
training data, yielding lower prediction errors than standard NODEs for both
examples. The proposed framework offers a data-efficient, control-oriented
modeling approach suitable for dynamic systems that require accurate trajectory
sensitivity prediction.

Motivation: 随着能源社区规模扩大和与电网集成度提高，在考虑配电节点边际价格影响的情况下，确保参与者间运营成本公平分配成为挑战。现有方法大多未考虑DLMPs的影响。

Method: 建立双层优化模型：上层由社区能源聚合商调度多个能源社区的DERs，下层由配电系统运营商通过网络约束调度确定DLMPs。利用KKT条件和强对偶性将双层模型转化为可处理的单层问题，并应用Shapley值量化每个社区对系统范围成本节约的边际贡献。

Result: 通过在多个基准配电系统上的仿真验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够公平地分配能源社区间的运营成本，同时考虑了分布式能源资源调度对配电节点边际价格的影响。

Abstract: Energy communities (ECs) are emerging as a promising decentralized model for
managing cooperative distributed energy resources (DERs). As these communities
expand and their operations become increasingly integrated into the grid,
ensuring fairness in allocating operating costs among participants becomes a
challenge. In distribution networks, DER operations at the community level can
influence Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMPs), which in turn affect
system's operation cost. This interdependence between local decisions and
system-level pricing introduces new challenges for fair and transparent cost
allocation. Despite growing interest in fairness-aware methods, most methods do
not account for the impact of DLMPs. To fill this gap, we propose a bilevel
optimization model in which a Community Energy Aggregator (CEA) schedules DERs
across multiple ECs while a Distribution System Operator (DSO) determines DLMPs
through network-constrained dispatch. Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions and strong duality, the bilevel model is reformulated into a
tractable single-level problem. We achieve fairness in the cost allocation by
applying the Shapley value to quantify each community's marginal contribution
to system-wide cost savings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
validated through simulations on several benchmark distribution systems.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效增强电力系统的暂态稳定性，解决了传统方法在模型依赖性和可扩展性方面的局限性。

Abstract: The integration of converter-interfaced generation introduces new transient
stability challenges to modern power systems. Classical Lyapunov- and scalable
passivity-based approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions, and
finding storage functions for large grids is generally considered intractable.
Furthermore, most methods require an accurate grid dynamics model. To address
these challenges, we propose a model-free, nonlinear, and dissipativity-based
controller which, when applied to grid-connected virtual synchronous generators
(VSGs), enhances power system transient stability. Using input-state data, we
train neural networks to learn dissipativity-characterizing matrices that yield
stabilizing controllers. Furthermore, we incorporate cost function shaping to
improve the performance with respect to the user-specified objectives.
Numerical results on a modified, all-VSG Kundur two-area power system validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合全局积分终端滑模控制和反步控制的复合控制器，用于解决电动汽车接入独立直流微电网时的稳定性问题，通过虚拟电容和分数功率趋近律提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车接入独立直流微电网时，其恒功率负载特性会产生负增量阻抗，同时微电网存在固有的低惯量问题，导致系统稳定性挑战。

Method: 采用全局积分终端滑模控制与反步控制相结合的复合控制器，使用虚拟电容缓解低惯量问题，改进的分数功率趋近律减少抖振并加速收敛，通过精确反馈线性化处理非线性问题。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比现有控制器，超调量减少34.4-53.3%，下冲量减少52.9-74.9%，稳定时间减少12-47.4%。

Conclusion: 所提出的复合控制器能有效解决电动汽车接入直流微电网时的稳定性问题，显著改善系统动态性能。

Abstract: When electric vehicles (EVs) are integrated into standalone DC microgrids
(DCMGs), stability issues arise due to their constant power load (CPL)
behavior, which provides negative incremental impedance (NII). In addition, the
microgrids suffer from an inherent low-inertia problem. Therefore, this study
presents a composite controller incorporating a global integral terminal
sliding mode controller with a backstepping controller. A virtual capacitor is
employed to mitigate the low-inertia issue and strengthen the DC-bus response.
An improved fractional power-based reaching law decreases chattering and
accelerates convergence. Exact feedback linearization converts the nonlinear
boost converter model into Brunovsky's canonical form, mitigating NII effects
and non-minimum phase issues. The entire system stability is verified using
Lyapunov control theory. Simulation outcomes confirm superior performance, with
34.4-53.3% reduction in overshoot, 52.9-74.9% in undershoot, and 12-47.4% in
settling time compared to the existing controller.

Abstract: The rapid increase in renewable energy sources (RES) implementation in the
power system creates more severe network congestion, which may reduce grid
operation efficiency and cause renewable curtailment. Deterministic
optimization for the unit commitment shows that battery energy storage system
(BESS)-based Virtual Transmission Line (VTL), as an alternative to physical
transmission lines, can offer a quick solution for congestion relief, reduced
operational costs, and lowered renewable curtailment. This paper aims to
evaluate the benefits of VTL when considering Renewable Energy Sources
uncertainty. Particularly, this work proposes a scenario-based stochastic
security-constrained unit commitment model considering VTL, referred to as
SSCUC-VTL. It incorporates the forecast error of RES into the commitment
decision for systems with VTL. The performance of applying the VTL strategy is
compared to that of adding a new physical transmission line and a standalone
BESS. A case study has been conducted on an enhanced IEEE 24-bus test system.
The simulation results demonstrate that VTL provides 23% more operational cost
reduction than the physical transmission line, and up to 67% more congestion
relief than the standalone BESS in a power system with solar and wind
generation.

the paper, and they are introduced to address the curse of dimensionality that
can arise for some types of nonparametric adaptive control strategies. The
maneuver vRKHSs are derived based on the structure of a compact, l-dimensional,
smooth Riemannian manifold M that is regularly embedded in the state space X =
Rn, where M is assumed to approximately support the ultimate dynamics of the
reference system to be tracked.

<details>

Motivation: 针对非线性多智能体系统在有界扰动下的安全控制问题，需要开发能够提供严格安全保证的控制器合成方法。

Method: 利用鲁棒正不变(RPI)管的几何特性，通过其支撑函数导出状态相关的安全裕度，然后系统性地收紧施加在名义规划器上的高相对阶指数控制屏障函数(eCBF)约束。

Result: 该方法保证任何满足收紧约束的名义轨迹都对应真实受扰系统的可证明安全轨迹，并在分布式模型预测控制(MPC)方案中实现了实用应用。

Conclusion: 提出的集成合成方法为非线性多智能体系统提供了具有鲁棒安全保证的控制器设计框架，能够同时优化性能并确保安全。

Abstract: This paper presents a constructive framework for synthesizing provably safe
controllers for nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to bounded disturbances.
The methodology applies to systems representable in Brunovsky canonical form,
accommodating arbitrary-order dynamics in multi-dimensional spaces. The central
contribution is a method of constraint tightening that formally couples robust
error feedback with nominal trajectory planning. The key insight is that the
design of an ancillary feedback law, which confines state errors to a robust
positively invariant (RPI) tube, simultaneously provides the exact information
needed to ensure the safety of the nominal plan. Specifically, the geometry of
the resulting RPI tube is leveraged via its support function to derive
state-dependent safety margins. These margins are then used to systematically
tighten the high relative-degree exponential control barrier function (eCBF)
constraints imposed on the nominal planner. This integrated synthesis
guarantees that any nominal trajectory satisfying the tightened constraints
corresponds to a provably safe trajectory for the true, disturbed system. We
demonstrate the practical utility of this formal synthesis method by
implementing the planner within a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC)
scheme, which optimizes performance while inheriting the robust safety
guarantees.

Conclusion: 所提出的最优结构梯度编码方案在异构分布式学习环境中有效缓解了慢节点问题，提高了系统性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an optimally structured gradient coding scheme to
mitigate the straggler problem in distributed learning. Conventional gradient
coding methods often assume homogeneous straggler models or rely on excessive
data replication, limiting performance in real-world heterogeneous systems. To
address these limitations, we formulate an optimization problem minimizing
residual error while ensuring unbiased gradient estimation by explicitly
considering individual straggler probabilities. We derive closed-form solutions
for optimal encoding and decoding coefficients via Lagrangian duality and
convex optimization, and propose data allocation strategies that reduce both
redundancy and computation load. We also analyze convergence behavior for
$\lambda$-strongly convex and $\mu$-smooth loss functions. Numerical results
show that our approach significantly reduces the impact of stragglers and
accelerates convergence compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 该方法为需要实时实现的安全关键控制应用提供了构造性和计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents an ellipsoidal set-theoretic framework for robust safety
filter synthesis in constrained linear systems subject to additive bounded
disturbances and input constraints. We formulate the safety filter design as a
convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem that simultaneously
computes a robust controlled invariant (RCI) ellipsoidal set and its associated
state-feedback control law. The RCI set is characterized as an ellipsoidal set,
enabling computational tractability for high-dimensional systems while
providing formal safety guarantees. The safety filter employs a smooth mixing
strategy between nominal and backup controllers based on distance to the
invariant set boundary, facilitating minimal intervention when the system
operates safely. The proposed method extends to nonlinear systems by treating
nonlinear terms as bounded disturbances with rigorous approximation bounds.
Numerical validation on a six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor system demonstrates
the filter's effectiveness in maintaining stability under external disturbances
and aggressive maneuvers while preserving nominal performance during safe
operation. The approach provides a constructive and computationally efficient
solution for safety-critical control applications requiring real-time
implementation.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差偏置补偿双扩展卡尔曼滤波器(RBC-DEKF)，用于解决磷酸铁锂电池SOC估计中OCV-SOC特性平坦导致的观测性问题，显著提高了估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 磷酸铁锂电池的开路电压-荷电状态(OCV-SOC)特性相对平坦，降低了系统的可观测性，这给基于模型的SOC估计带来了挑战。

Method: 采用双滤波器结构，一个EKF估计控制导向的参数分组单粒子模型的热效应系统状态，另一个EKF估计残差偏置，实时修正电压观测方程。

Result: 在三种典型工况下验证，相比传统EKF，平均SOC RMSE从3.75%降低到0.20%，电压RMSE从32.8mV降低到0.8mV，在OCV-SOC曲线平坦的中SOC区间改进最明显。

Conclusion: 残差偏置补偿方法显著提高了磷酸铁锂电池在宽温度范围内的基于模型SOC估计精度，特别是在OCV-SOC曲线平坦区域。

Abstract: This paper addresses state of charge (SOC) estimation for lithium iron
phosphate (LFP) batteries, where the relatively flat open-circuit voltage
(OCV-SOC) characteristic reduces observability. A residual bias compensation
dual extended Kalman filter (RBC-DEKF) is developed. Unlike conventional bias
compensation methods that treat the bias as an augmented state within a single
filter, the proposed dual-filter structure decouples residual bias estimation
from electrochemical state estimation. One EKF estimates the system states of a
control-oriented parameter-grouped single particle model with thermal effects,
while the other EKF estimates a residual bias that continuously corrects the
voltage observation equation, thereby refining the model-predicted voltage in
real time. Unlike bias-augmented single-filter schemes that enlarge the
covariance coupling, the decoupled bias estimator refines the voltage
observation without perturbing electrochemical state dynamics. Validation is
conducted on an LFP cell from a public dataset under three representative
operating conditions: US06 at 0 degC, DST at 25 degC, and FUDS at 50 degC.
Compared with a conventional EKF using the same model and identical state
filter settings, the proposed method reduces the average SOC RMSE from 3.75% to
0.20% and the voltage RMSE between the filtered model voltage and the measured
voltage from 32.8 mV to 0.8 mV. The improvement is most evident in the mid-SOC
range where the OCV-SOC curve is flat, confirming that residual bias
compensation significantly enhances accuracy for model-based SOC estimation of
LFP batteries across a wide temperature range.

Motivation: 解决马尔可夫SIS模型状态空间随节点数指数增长（2^n）导致的计算复杂性问题，寻求更高效的病毒传播控制方法。

Method: 使用TransNNs近似马尔可夫SIS模型，提出基于TransNN的滚动时域控制方法，并与动态规划解和TransNN最优控制进行比较。

Result: TransNNs能有效近似SIS模型，提出的滚动时域控制方法相比动态规划显著节省计算资源，且比TransNN最优控制产生更不保守的控制动作。

Conclusion: TransNNs为复杂网络病毒传播控制提供了计算高效的近似方法，滚动时域控制策略在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Transmission Neural Networks (TransNNs) proposed by Gao and Caines (2022)
serve as both virus spread models over networks and neural network models with
tuneable activation functions. This paper establishes that TransNNs provide
upper bounds on the infection probability generated from the associated
Markovian stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model with 2^n
state configurations where n is the number of nodes in the network, and can be
employed as an approximate model for the latter. Based on such an
approximation, a TransNN-based receding horizon control approach for mitigating
virus spread is proposed and we demonstrate that it allows significant
computational savings compared to the dynamic programming solution to Markovian
SIS model with 2^n state configurations, as well as providing less conservative
control actions compared to the TransNN-based optimal control. Finally,
numerical comparisons among (a) dynamic programming solutions for the Markovian
SIS model, (b) TransNN-based optimal control and (c) the proposed TransNN-based
receding horizon control are presented.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出NeuroDOB，一种基于深度神经网络的车辆横向动力学观测控制器，用DNN替代传统扰动观测器，通过从驾驶员在环仿真中学习转向补偿信号来增强个性化横向控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DOB只能补偿一般扰动如路面摩擦变化和侧风，而NeuroDOB明确处理未建模车辆动力学和驾驶员特定行为，实现个性化自适应控制。

Method: 将NeuroDOB与线性二次调节器(LQR)集成，DNN输出误差修正量加到基线LQR转向输入中；DNN输入特征包括横向位置和偏航角误差以及LQR控制输入。

Result: 在CarSim中使用横向动态自行车模型的实验验证表明，NeuroDOB有效适应个体驾驶习惯，横向控制性能优于传统LQR控制器。

Conclusion: 基于深度神经网络的观测器有潜力实现个性化和自适应自动驾驶控制；架构可视为双系统控制结构，LQR对应快速分析的系统1，NeuroDOB对应数据驱动的系统2，形成类似人类直觉-反思交互的集成决策过程。

Abstract: This paper proposes NeuroDOB, a deep neural network based observer controller
for vehicle lateral dynamics, which replaces the conventional disturbance
observer (DOB) with a deep neural network (DNN) to enhance personalized lateral
control. Unlike conventional DOBs that compensate for general disturbances such
as road friction variation and crosswind, NeuroDOB explicitly addresses
unmodeled vehicle dynamics and driver-specific behaviors by learning the
steering compensation signal from driver-in-the-loop simulations using CarSim's
embedded controller as a surrogate driver. The proposed architecture integrates
NeuroDOB with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR), where the DNN outputs a delta
error correction added to the baseline LQR steering input to produce the final
control command. Input features to the DNN include lateral position and yaw
angle errors, and the LQR control input. Experimental validation using a
lateral dynamic bicycle model within CarSim demonstrates that NeuroDOB
effectively adapts to individual driving habits, improving lateral control
performance beyond what conventional LQR controllers achieve. The results
indicate the potential of deep neural network based observer to enable
personalized and adaptive autonomous vehicle control. In cognitive terms, the
proposed architecture can be viewed as a dual-system control structure. The
baseline LQR corresponds to System 1, a model-based, fast, and analytic
reasoning layer ensuring stability. The NeuroDOB acts as System 2, a
reflective, data-driven layer that learns compensation from experience and
corrects the analytical bias of System 1. Together, they form an integrated
decision process analogous to human intuition-reflection interaction, enabling
both stability and adaptability in lateral control.

Abstract: Dependability is the ability to consistently deliver trusted and
uninterrupted service in the face of operational uncertainties. Ensuring
dependable operation in large-scale, energy-constrained Internet of Things
(IoT) deployments is as crucial as challenging, and calls for context-aware
protocols where context refers to situational or state information. In this
paper, we identify four critical context dimensions for IoT networks, namely
energy status, information freshness, task relevance, and physical/medium
conditions, and show how each one underpins core dependability attributes.
Building on these insights, we propose a two-step protocol design framework
that incorporates operation-specific context fields. Through three
representative use cases, we demonstrate how context awareness can
significantly enhance system dependability while imposing only minimal
control-plane overhead.

Conclusion: 刺绣致动器提供了一种通过图案设计实现可控织物变形的新方法，为软体机器人应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Embroidery Actuator, a fabric-integrated
pneumatic actuator that enables diverse and controllable deformations through
embroidery pattern design. Unlike conventional fabric actuators that rely on
fiber- or thread-shaped actuators, the proposed actuator is fabricated by
directly stitching an inflatable tube onto the fabric using a cord-embroidery
technique. The embroidered thread and the fabric jointly form a sleeve that
constrains the expansion of the inflatable tube, converting internal pressure
into targeted bending or stretching deformations. By varying the embroidery
pattern, such as zigzag or cross configurations, different geometric
constraints can be realized, allowing for flexible control of deformation
direction and magnitude. Analytical deformation models based on the Neo-Hookean
model and Lagrange's equations were developed to predict the relationship
between pneumatic pressure and bending angle, and were experimentally validated
using motion-capture measurements. The results demonstrated that the actuator
achieves strong agreement with the analytical deformation model.

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了机器学习加速与AC-OPF解决方案安全实时部署之间的差距，为数据驱动的最优控制铺平了道路。

Abstract: The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is central to power system
operation but challenging to solve efficiently due to its nonconvex and
nonlinear nature. Neural networks (NNs) offer fast surrogates, yet their
black-box behavior raises concerns about constraint violations that can
compromise safety. We propose a verification-informed NN framework that
incorporates worst-case constraint violations directly into training, producing
models that are both accurate and provably safer. Through post-hoc
verification, we achieve substantial reductions in worst-case violations and,
for the first time, verify all operational constraints of large-scale AC-OPF
proxies. Practical feasibility is further enhanced via restoration and
warm-start strategies for infeasible operating points. Experiments on systems
ranging from 57 to 793 buses demonstrate scalability, speed, and reliability,
bridging the gap between ML acceleration and safe, real-time deployment of
AC-OPF solutions - and paving the way toward data-driven optimal control.

Abstract: A novel modular control framework for reconfigurable rigid multibody systems
is proposed, motivated by the challenges of modular control of systems with
closed kinematic chains. In the framework, modularity is defined in the sense
of degrees of freedom, and the inertial properties of each body are partitioned
with respect to how they are reflected in the kinetic energy of the system
through the motion induced by each degree of freedom. This approach inherently
handles closed chains in the same manner as tree-like structures, eliminating
the need for explicit constraint force calculations or formulations based on
differential-algebraic equations. The proposed framework is implemented via
simulation on a three-degree-of-freedom series-parallel manipulator, with the
results being consistent with the expected stability and tracking performance,
and indicating the framework's potential for scalability in trajectory-tracking
control of multibody systems.

Abstract: Cable-suspended aerial transportation systems are employed extensively across
various industries. The capability to flexibly adjust the relative position
between the multirotor and the payload has spurred growing interest in the
system equipped with variable-length cable, promising broader application
potential. Compared to systems with fixed-length cables, introducing the
variable-length cable adds a new degree of freedom. However, it also results in
increased nonlinearity and more complex dynamic coupling among the multirotor,
the cable and the payload, posing significant challenges in control design.
This paper introduces a backstepping control strategy tailored for aerial
transportation systems with variable-length cable, designed to precisely track
the payload trajectory while dynamically adjusting cable length. Then, a cable
length generator has been developed that achieves online optimization of the
cable length while satisfying state constraints, thus balancing the
multirotor's motion and cable length changes without the need for manual
trajectory planning. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is
guaranteed through Lyapunov techniques and the growth restriction condition.
Finally, simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in
managing trajectory tracking and cable length adjustments effectively.

Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback
linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are
accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety
considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier
functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability,
ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric
uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the
parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is
assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing
stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective
are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on
the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all
of the theoretical developments.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理电力系统中的不确定性和安全约束问题，为(N-1)安全运行提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The intermittent nature of renewable power availability is one of the major
sources of uncertainty in power systems. While markets can guarantee that the
demand is covered by the available generation, transmission system operators
have to often intervene via economic redispatch to ensure that the physical
constraints of the network are satisfied. To account for uncertainty, the
underlying optimal power flow (OPF) routines have to be modified. Recently,
polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) has been suggested in the literature as a tool
for stochastic OPF problems. However, the usage of PCE-based methods in
security-constrained OPF for (N-1)-secure operations has not yet been explored.
In this paper, we propose a procedure that iteratively solves a PCE-overloaded
stochastic OPF problem by including line outage constraints until an
(N-1)-secure solution is achieved. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by
comparing it with a Monte-Carlo simulation on a 118-bus example system.

Abstract: Accurate monitoring of pest population dynamics is crucial for informed
decision-making in precision agriculture. Currently, mainstream image-based
pest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine
learning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have
limitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To
address this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with
trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting
in water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest
counting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the
distribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded
individuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the
impact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and
selected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed
six representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle,
spiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And
by comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of
different stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we
determined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting
confidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed
stirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive
frames as feedback to adjust the stirring speed. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study dedicated to investigating the effects of different
stirring trajectories on object counting in the dynamic liquid environment and
to implement adaptive-speed stirring for this type of task. Experimental
results show ...

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统左心耳封堵术依赖手动导管控制和荧光透视成像，存在辐射暴露和定位精度有限的问题。

Method: 使用光纤布拉格光栅力传感导管结合电磁跟踪，在解剖模型中进行机器人辅助左心耳封堵器部署，并提出了力-位移分析方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有望为临床医生提供增强的术中反馈，改善部署结果，未来将专注于自动化步骤分类和在动态环境中验证传感策略。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolic events due to
impaired function of the left atrial appendage (LAA). Left atrial appendage
closure (LAAC) is a minimally invasive intervention designed to reduce stroke
risk by sealing the LAA with an expandable occluder device. Current deployment
relies on manual catheter control and imaging modalities like fluoroscopy and
transesophageal echocardiography, which carry limitations including radiation
exposure and limited positioning precision. In this study, we leverage a
previously developed force-sensing delivery sheath integrating fiber Bragg
gratings (FBGs) at the interface between the catheter and the occluder.
Combined with electromagnetic (EM) tracking, this setup enables real-time
measurement of interaction forces and catheter tip position during
robot-assisted LAAC deployment in an anatomical phantom. We present a novel
force-displacement profiling method that characterizes occluder deployment
dynamics and identifies key procedural steps without relying on ionizing
radiation. The force profiles reveal low-magnitude interaction forces,
suggesting minimal mechanical stress on the surrounding anatomy. This approach
shows promise in providing clinicians with enhanced intraoperative feedback,
improving deployment outcome. Future work will focus on automating deployment
steps classification and validating the sensing strategy in dynamic, realistic
environments.

Conclusion: 该研究开发的相位感知AI跟车模型能够有效捕捉电动汽车的独特动力学特性，在交通仿真中提供更准确的电动汽车行为表示

Abstract: Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) exhibit
distinct vehicle dynamics. EVs provide rapid acceleration, with electric motors
producing peak power across a wider speed range, and achieve swift deceleration
through regenerative braking. While existing microscopic models effectively
capture the driving behavior of ICE vehicles, a modeling framework that
accurately describes the unique car-following dynamics of EVs is lacking.
Developing such a model is essential given the increasing presence of EVs in
traffic, yet creating an easy-to-use and accurate analytical model remains
challenging.
  To address these gaps, this study develops and validates a Phase-Aware AI
(PAAI) car-following model specifically for EVs. The proposed model enhances
traditional physics-based frameworks with an AI component that recognizes and
adapts to different driving phases, such as rapid acceleration and regenerative
braking. Using real-world trajectory data from vehicles equipped with adaptive
cruise control (ACC), we conduct comprehensive simulations to validate the
model's performance. The numerical results demonstrate that the PAAI model
significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional car-following
models, providing an effective tool for accurately representing EV behavior in
traffic simulations.

TL;DR: 提出基于LSTM和物理约束的自适应巡航控制框架，通过社会价值取向使自动驾驶车辆考虑对人工驾驶车辆和交通流的影响，提升系统效率和降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶控制策略主要关注单个车辆或车队的性能优化，忽视了与人工驾驶车辆的交互及对整体交通流的影响，这可能导致拥堵加剧和系统效率降低。

Method: 采用神经网络和物理约束的控制框架，引入社会价值取向(SVO)，定义自动驾驶车辆和人工驾驶车辆的效用函数，平衡个体控制目标与交通流考虑。

Result: 当自动驾驶车辆控制模式从优先能耗转向优化交通流效率时，跟随车队车辆个体能耗增加至少58.99%，同时个体平均速度提升至少38.39%，显著改善交通动态。

Conclusion: 所提出的社会兼容控制框架能有效适应不同交通条件，通过自动驾驶车辆作为移动交通调节器，减少拥堵、提高交通效率并降低能耗。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel control framework for adaptive cruise control
(ACC) in automated driving, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
and physics-informed constraints. As automated vehicles (AVs) adopt advanced
features like ACC, transportation systems are becoming increasingly intelligent
and efficient. However, existing AV control strategies primarily focus on
optimizing the performance of individual vehicles or platoons, often neglecting
their interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs) and the broader impact on
traffic flow. This oversight can exacerbate congestion and reduce overall
system efficiency. To address this critical research gap, we propose a neural
network-based, socially compliant AV control framework that incorporates social
value orientation (SVO). This framework enables AVs to account for their
influence on HVs and traffic dynamics. By leveraging AVs as mobile traffic
regulators, the proposed approach promotes adaptive driving behaviors that
reduce congestion, improve traffic efficiency, and lower energy consumption.
Within this framework, we define utility functions for both AVs and HVs, which
are optimized based on the SVO of each AV to balance its own control objectives
with broader traffic flow considerations. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting to varying traffic conditions,
thereby enhancing system-wide efficiency. Specifically, when the AV's control
mode shifts from prioritizing energy consumption to optimizing traffic flow
efficiency, vehicles in the following platoon experience at least a 58.99%
increase in individual energy consumption alongside at least a 38.39%
improvement in individual average speed, indicating significant enhancements in
traffic dynamics.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
capabilities in various automation domains, particularly Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) operations, have garnered increasing attention. Current research
remains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most
studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones,
while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems
in real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct
challenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and
landing procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized
operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position
paper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive
demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV
operations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to
orchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key
technical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii)
Route Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner
for waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory
implementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility
through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales:
multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the
current implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that
charts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully
autonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical
prerequisites and research challenges at each stage.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FORGE-Tree是一个插件控制层，通过结合阶段对齐的扩散强制头和测试时蒙特卡洛树扩散，解决VLA策略在长时程机器人操作任务中的漂移和暴露偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程机器人操作任务对VLA策略具有挑战性，因为漂移和暴露偏差会导致小的几何误差在阶段间累积，且缺乏在紧密间隙处分配额外计算资源的机制。

Method: 使用冻结的VLA编码器，扩散强制头将时间步与子任务阶段对齐；在推理时部分去噪目标段而冻结其他标记，将轨迹优化转化为局部编辑序列。然后应用蒙特卡洛树扩散选择下一个要优化的段。场景图提供扩展先验和几何关系感知评分。

Result: 在LIBERO评估中，FORGE-Tree相比原生VLA基线（OpenVLA和Octo-Base）将成功率提高了13.4到17.2个百分点。在可比较的计算预算下，增益保持一致，特别是在长时程变体上。

Conclusion: FORGE-Tree通过树结构去噪方法有效提升了VLA策略在长时程机器人操作任务中的性能，且性能随搜索预算扩展而提升，同时保持已执行前缀。

Abstract: Long-horizon robot manipulation tasks remain challenging for
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies due to drift and exposure bias, often
denoise the entire trajectory with fixed hyperparameters, causing small
geometric errors to compound across stages and offering no mechanism to
allocate extra test-time compute where clearances are tight. To address these
challenges, we introduce FORGE-Tree, a plug-in control layer that couples a
stage-aligned Diffusion Forcing (DF) head with test-time Monte Carlo Tree
Diffusion (MCTD). With a frozen VLA encoder, DF aligns timesteps to subtask
stages; during inference we partially denoise only a target segment while
keeping other tokens frozen, turning trajectory refinement into a sequence of
local edits. We then apply Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion to select the next
segment to refine. A scene graph supplies priors for expansion and geometry
relation-aware scoring for rollouts, yielding tree-structured denoising whose
performance scales with search budget while preserving the executed prefix.
Evaluation on LIBERO, FORGE-Tree improves success rate by 13.4 to 17.2 pp over
the native VLA baselines with both OpenVLA and Octo-Base. Gains remain
consistent under comparable compute budgets, especially on long-horizon
variants. Videos available at: https://taco-group.github.io/FORGE-Tree/

TL;DR: Avi是一个新颖的3D视觉-语言-动作架构，将机器人动作生成重新定义为3D感知和空间推理问题，而非低级策略学习。它利用3D点云和语言基础场景理解，通过经典几何变换计算动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要基于2D视觉输入，通过端到端训练学习任务特定的动作策略。Avi旨在通过3D感知和空间推理，实现更通用、更鲁棒的机器人行为，克服遮挡、相机姿态变化和视角变化等问题。

Method: Avi基于3D多模态大语言模型生成下一个点云，通过经典变换显式计算动作。它不训练之前的动作标记，而是将机器人决策过程视为对3D表示的结构化推理任务。

Result: 初步结果显示，Avi能够产生对遮挡、相机姿态变化和视角变化具有鲁棒性的通用行为。该方法在高层次语言指令和低层次驱动之间架起了桥梁，无需不透明的策略学习。

Conclusion: 3D视觉-语言推理有潜力作为可扩展、鲁棒机器人系统的基础。Avi展示了通过3D感知和空间推理实现机器人动作生成的新途径。

Abstract: We propose Avi, a novel 3D Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture that
reframes robotic action generation as a problem of 3D perception and spatial
reasoning, rather than low-level policy learning. While existing VLA models
primarily operate on 2D visual inputs and are trained end-to-end on
task-specific action policies, Avi leverages 3D point clouds and
language-grounded scene understanding to compute actions through classical
geometric transformations. Most notably, Avi does not train on previous action
tokens, rather, we build upon a 3D Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
generate the next point cloud and explicitly calculate the actions through
classical transformations. This approach enables generalizable behaviors that
are robust to occlusions, camera pose variations, and changes in viewpoint. By
treating the robotic decision-making process as a structured reasoning task
over 3D representations, Avi bridges the gap between high-level language
instructions and low-level actuation without requiring opaque policy learning.
Our preliminary results highlight the potential of 3D vision-language reasoning
as a foundation for scalable, robust robotic systems. Check it out at

Motivation: 为了弥补机器人感知领域在详细物体属性标注方面的不足，特别是在日语人机对话场景中，需要更丰富的上下文敏感属性标注来提升多模态感知性能。

Method: 构建J-ORA数据集，包含详细的物体属性模板（类别、颜色、形状、大小、材质和空间关系），并利用专有和开源视觉语言模型进行广泛评估。

Result: 实验表明，加入详细物体属性显著提升了多模态感知性能，但专有和开源VLMs之间仍存在差距。不同VLMs在理解物体功能和上下文关系方面表现出不同能力。

Conclusion: 丰富的上下文敏感属性标注对于在动态环境中推进机器人感知至关重要，J-ORA数据集为这一领域提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We introduce J-ORA, a novel multimodal dataset that bridges the gap in robot
perception by providing detailed object attribute annotations within Japanese
human-robot dialogue scenarios. J-ORA is designed to support three critical
perception tasks, object identification, reference resolution, and next-action
prediction, by leveraging a comprehensive template of attributes (e.g.,
category, color, shape, size, material, and spatial relations). Extensive
evaluations with both proprietary and open-source Vision Language Models (VLMs)
reveal that incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves
multimodal perception performance compared to without object attributes.
Despite the improvement, we find that there still exists a gap between
proprietary and open-source VLMs. In addition, our analysis of object
affordances demonstrates varying abilities in understanding object
functionality and contextual relationships across different VLMs. These
findings underscore the importance of rich, context-sensitive attribute
annotations in advancing robot perception in dynamic environments. See project

Abstract: By 2050, the global demand for assistive care is expected to reach 3.5
billion people, far outpacing the availability of human caregivers. Existing
robotic solutions remain expensive and require technical expertise, limiting
accessibility. This work introduces a low-cost robotic arm for assistive tasks
such as feeding, cleaning spills, and fetching medicine. The system uses
imitation learning from demonstration videos, requiring no task-specific
programming or manual labeling. The robot consists of six servo motors, dual
cameras, and 3D-printed grippers. Data collection via teleoperation with a
leader arm yielded 50,000 video frames across the three tasks. A novel Phased
Action Chunking Transformer (PACT) captures temporal dependencies and segments
motion dynamics, while a Temporal Ensemble (TE) method refines trajectories to
improve accuracy and smoothness. Evaluated across five model sizes and four
architectures, with ten hours of real-world testing, the system achieved over
90% task accuracy, up to 40% higher than baselines. PACT enabled a 5x model
size reduction while maintaining 75% accuracy. Saliency analysis showed
reliance on key visual cues, and phase token gradients peaked at critical
trajectory moments, indicating effective temporal reasoning. Future work will
explore bimanual manipulation and mobility for expanded assistive capabilities.

Abstract: Quadratic programming (QP) underpins real-time robotics by enabling
efficient, constrained optimization in state estimation, motion planning, and
control. In legged locomotion and manipulation, essential modules like inverse
dynamics, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Whole-Body Control (WBC) are
inherently QP-based, demanding reliable solutions amid tight timing, energy,
and computational limits on embedded platforms. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis and benchmarking study of cutting-edge QP solvers for
legged robotics. We begin by formulating the standard convex QP and classify
solvers into four principal algorithmic approaches, including interior-point
methods, active-set strategies, operator splitting schemes, and augmented
Lagrangian approaches. Each solver is examined in terms of algorithmic
structure, computational characteristics, and its ability to exploit problem
structure and warm-starting. Performance is evaluated using publicly available
benchmarks, focusing on metrics such as computation time, constraint
satisfaction, and robustness under perturbations. Feature tables and
comparisons yield practical guidance for solver selection, underscoring
trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency. Our findings emphasize
the synergy between solver, task, and hardware, sparse IPMs for long-horizon
MPC, and dense active-set for high frequency WBC to advance agile, autonomous
legged systems, with emerging extensions to nonconvex and distributed QP.

Abstract: This paper introduces SPIRAL (Self-Play Incremental Racing Algorithm for
Learning), a novel approach for training autonomous drones in multi-agent
racing competitions. SPIRAL distinctively employs a self-play mechanism to
incrementally cultivate complex racing behaviors within a challenging, dynamic
environment. Through this self-play core, drones continuously compete against
increasingly proficient versions of themselves, naturally escalating the
difficulty of competitive interactions. This progressive learning journey
guides agents from mastering fundamental flight control to executing
sophisticated cooperative multi-drone racing strategies. Our method is designed
for versatility, allowing integration with any state-of-the-art Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms within its self-play framework.
Simulations demonstrate the significant advantages of SPIRAL and benchmark the
performance of various DRL algorithms operating within it. Consequently, we
contribute a versatile, scalable, and self-improving learning framework to the
field of autonomous drone racing. SPIRAL's capacity to autonomously generate
appropriate and escalating challenges through its self-play dynamic offers a
promising direction for developing robust and adaptive racing strategies in
multi-agent environments. This research opens new avenues for enhancing the
performance and reliability of autonomous racing drones in increasingly complex
and competitive scenarios.

TL;DR: VITA-E是一个新颖的具身交互框架，通过双模型架构实现行为并发和实时中断处理，使具身代理能够同时观察环境、听取语音、提供回应并执行动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型受限于僵化的静态交互范式，缺乏同时观察、听取、说话和执行动作的能力，也无法动态处理实时用户中断，这阻碍了无缝的具身协作。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个并行VLA实例分别作为"主动模型"和"待机模型"，并提出"模型即控制器"范式，微调VLM生成特殊令牌作为系统级命令。

Result: 在物理人形平台上进行的实验表明，VITA-E能够可靠处理复杂交互场景，在紧急停止和语音中断方面达到极高成功率，并能成功执行并发语音和动作。

Conclusion: 该框架代表了向更自然、更强大的具身助手迈出的重要一步，兼容各种双系统VLA模型。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid,
static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and
act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically.
This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and
unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce
VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral
concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a
dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active
Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its
environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute
actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking
capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we
fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level
commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior.
Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E
can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible
with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate
on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing
concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more
natural and capable embodied assistants.

Abstract: The coordination of multiple autonomous agents in high-speed, competitive
environments represents a significant engineering challenge. This paper
presents CRUISE (Curriculum-Based Iterative Self-Play for Scalable Multi-Drone
Racing), a reinforcement learning framework designed to solve this challenge in
the demanding domain of multi-drone racing. CRUISE overcomes key scalability
limitations by synergistically combining a progressive difficulty curriculum
with an efficient self-play mechanism to foster robust competitive behaviors.
Validated in high-fidelity simulation with realistic quadrotor dynamics, the
resulting policies significantly outperform both a standard reinforcement
learning baseline and a state-of-the-art game-theoretic planner. CRUISE
achieves nearly double the planner's mean racing speed, maintains high success
rates, and demonstrates robust scalability as agent density increases. Ablation
studies confirm that the curriculum structure is the critical component for
this performance leap. By providing a scalable and effective training
methodology, CRUISE advances the development of autonomous systems for dynamic,
competitive tasks and serves as a blueprint for future real-world deployment.

<details>

Motivation: Stewart-Gough平台在医疗、工程、航天等关键应用中需要微米和纳米级的精确运动控制，因此高精度校准至关重要。正向运动学校准过于复杂，而逆运动学校准则更为简便有效。

Method: 通过外部仪器、约束系统运动、额外传感器等多种方法进行校准实验，重点关注逆运动学基础的并行机器人校准方法。

Result: 研究发现研究人员主要关注提高平台位置和方向精度，考虑单一或多重误差源，主要误差来源是运动学和结构误差，部分研究也考虑了环境因素。

Conclusion: 本文综述了Stewart-Gough平台校准领域的最新技术，突出了校准过程中考虑的过程和误差因素，为相关研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Researchers have studied Stewart-Gough platforms, also known as Gough-Stewart
platforms or hexapod platforms extensively for their inherent fine control
characteristics. Their studies led to the potential deployment opportunities of
Stewart-Gough Platforms in many critical applications such as the medical
field, engineering machines, space research, electronic chip manufacturing,
automobile manufacturing, etc. Some of these applications need micro and
nano-level movement control in 3D space for the motions to be precise,
complicated, and repeatable; a Stewart-Gough platform fulfills these challenges
smartly. For this, the platform must be more accurate than the specified
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a parallel robot is
crucial. Forward kinematics-based calibration for these hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To experiment with different calibration techniques, various
calibration approaches were implemented by using external instruments,
constraining one or more motions of the system, and using extra sensors for
auto or self-calibration. This survey paid attention to those key
methodologies, their outcome, and important details related to inverse
kinematic-based parallel robot calibrations. It was observed during this study
that the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position
and orientation considering the errors contributed by one source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly kinematic and structural, in
some cases, environmental factors also are reviewed, however, those
calibrations are done under no-load conditions. This study aims to review the
present state of the art in this field and highlight the processes and errors
considered for the calibration of Stewart-Gough platforms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Butter-Bench是一个评估大语言模型控制机器人实际智能的基准测试，发现人类表现（95%）远超最佳LLM（40%），LLM在多步空间规划和社会理解方面表现最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在物理世界中的实际智能表现，当前机器人系统采用分层架构，LLM负责高层推理，VLA负责底层控制，但需要单独评估LLM的实际智能能力。

Method: 开发Butter-Bench基准测试，专门评估LLM在机器人控制中的表现，隔离VLA模型的影响，测试LLM的多步空间规划和社会理解等能力。

Result: 人类平均得分95%，最佳LLM仅得40%，LLM在多步空间规划和社会理解方面表现最差，针对具身推理的微调训练也没有改善其表现。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM在分析智能方面超越人类，但在处理物理世界复杂性的实际智能方面仍远不及人类，特别是在空间规划和社会理解等关键能力上存在明显差距。

Abstract: We present Butter-Bench, a benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM)
controlled robots for practical intelligence, defined as the ability to
navigate the messiness of the physical world. Current state-of-the-art robotic
systems use a hierarchical architecture with LLMs in charge of high-level
reasoning, and a Vision Language Action (VLA) model for low-level control.
Butter-Bench evaluates the LLM part in isolation from the VLA. Although LLMs
have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical
intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best
LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. LLMs
struggled the most with multi-step spatial planning and social understanding.
We also evaluate LLMs that are fine-tuned for embodied reasoning and conclude
that this training does not improve their score on Butter-Bench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络(PINN)的无人机轨迹规划框架，将无人机动力学、风扰动和避障约束直接嵌入学习过程，无需监督数据即可生成动态可行且无碰撞的轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划器如A*和运动学RRT*由于离散化和采样限制，往往产生次优或不平滑的路径，无法在动态风场中生成安全且能量高效的轨迹。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络框架，通过最小化物理残差和风险感知目标来学习轨迹，无需监督数据，直接嵌入无人机动力学、风扰动和避障约束。

Result: 对比仿真显示，该方法在控制能量、平滑度和安全裕度方面优于A*和Kino-RRT*，同时保持相似的飞行效率。

Conclusion: 物理信息学习有潜力统一基于模型和数据驱动的规划方法，为无人机轨迹优化提供可扩展且物理一致的框架。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic wind fields must
generate safe and energy-efficient trajectories under physical and
environmental constraints. Traditional planners, such as A* and kinodynamic
RRT*, often yield suboptimal or non-smooth paths due to discretization and
sampling limitations. This paper presents a physics-informed neural network
(PINN) framework that embeds UAV dynamics, wind disturbances, and obstacle
avoidance directly into the learning process. Without requiring supervised
data, the PINN learns dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories by
minimizing physical residuals and risk-aware objectives. Comparative
simulations show that the proposed method outperforms A* and Kino-RRT* in
control energy, smoothness, and safety margin, while maintaining similar flight
efficiency. The results highlight the potential of physics-informed learning to
unify model-based and data-driven planning, providing a scalable and physically
consistent framework for UAV trajectory optimization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体强化学习的分布式位姿图优化框架，通过图神经网络编码器和混合策略来去噪并优化位姿估计，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升了全局目标优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分布式位姿图优化方法需要反复求解线性化方程，容易陷入局部最优解，且对异常值敏感。需要一种更鲁棒、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 将分布式PGO建模为部分可观测马尔可夫博弈，使用图分割器分解全局位姿图，每个机器人运行带自适应边门控的循环图神经网络编码器去噪，通过混合策略顺序优化位姿，最后通过共识方案协调机器人间差异。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的评估显示，相比最先进的分布式PGO框架，该方法平均减少37.5%的全局目标，推理效率提升至少6倍，且单个学习策略无需重新训练即可扩展到更大机器人团队。

Conclusion: 基于MARL的分布式PGO框架在精度和效率方面均优于传统方法，具有良好的可扩展性和鲁棒性，为多机器人SLAM提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is
fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a
highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal
equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal
estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO
framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed
PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where
each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner
decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent
edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating
to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid
policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local
graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to
produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a
comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5%
more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing
inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication
allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger
robot teams without any retraining. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/herolab-uga/policies-over-poses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在机器人控制领域直接沿用视觉任务的推理策略，没有针对控制任务中动作分布的结构化、低维特性进行优化，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 提出遗传去噪采样策略，通过选择具有低分布外风险的去噪轨迹来增强性能和稳定性，并针对具体任务特性优化去噪过程。

Result: 在D4RL和Robomimic的14个机器人操作任务中，该方法仅需2次神经网络评估就能解决挑战性任务，性能提升高达20%，在200万次评估中始终优于标准扩散策略。

Conclusion: 通过针对具体任务特性优化扩散模型的推理过程，可以显著提高机器人控制任务的效率和性能，为扩散模型在具身AI领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art
results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While
diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and
video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly
transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that
by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied
AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action
distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5
neural function evaluations (NFE).
  Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy,
genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting
denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves
challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We
evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and
Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2
million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard
diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with
significantly fewer inference steps.

Conclusion: 该工作为理解双足系统冠状面稳定机制提供了重要见解，展示了前馈稳定在减少控制能耗方面的潜力。

Abstract: Stability of bipedal systems in frontal plane is affected by the hip offset,
to the extent that adjusting stride time using feedforward retraction and
extension of the legs can lead to stable oscillations without feedback control.
This feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to reduce the control effort
and energy expenditure and increase the locomotion robustness. However, there
is limited understanding of how key parameters, such as mass, stiffness, leg
length, and hip width, affect stability and the minimum stride frequency needed
to maintain it. This study aims to address these gaps through analyzing how
individual model parameters and the system's natural frequency influence the
minimum stride frequency required to maintain a stable cycle. We propose a
method to predict the minimum stride frequency, and compare the predicted
stride frequencies with actual values for randomly generated models. The
findings of this work provide a better understanding of the frontal plane
stability mechanisms and how feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to
reduce the control effort.

Abstract: Robotic manipulators are increasingly used to assist individuals with
mobility impairments in object retrieval. However, the predominant
joystick-based control interfaces can be challenging due to high precision
requirements and unintuitive reference frames. Recent advances in human-robot

wearable Mixed Reality (MR) headset. Our system enables users to interact
seamlessly with real-world objects using natural gaze fixation from a
first-person perspective, while providing augmented visual cues to confirm
intent and leveraging a pretrained vision model and robotic arm for intent
recognition and object manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves manipulation accuracy, reduces system latency,
and achieves single-pass intention and object recognition accuracy greater than
88% across multiple real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in enhancing intuitiveness and accessibility,
underscoring its practical significance for assistive robotics applications.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) attitude

real-world disturbances, and efficient deployment. To address the above
challenges, this paper presents EasyUUV, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced,
universal, and lightweight simulation-to-reality reinforcement learning (RL)
framework for robust attitude control of UUVs. EasyUUV combines parallelized RL
training with a hybrid control architecture, where a learned policy outputs
high-level attitude corrections executed by an adaptive S-Surface controller. A
multimodal LLM is further integrated to adaptively tune controller parameters
at runtime using visual and textual feedback, enabling training-free adaptation
to unmodeled dynamics. Also, we have developed a low-cost 6-DoF UUV platform
and applied an RL policy trained through efficient parallelized simulation.
Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and
outstanding performance of EasyUUV in achieving robust and adaptive UUV

Abstract: Self-balancing exoskeletons offer a promising mobility solution for
individuals with lower-limb disabilities. For reliable long-term operation,
these exoskeletons require a perception system that is effective in changing
environments. In this work, we introduce LT-Exosense, a vision-centric,
multi-session mapping system designed to support long-term (semi)-autonomous
navigation for exoskeleton users. LT-Exosense extends single-session mapping
capabilities by incrementally fusing spatial knowledge across multiple
sessions, detecting environmental changes, and updating a persistent global
map. This representation enables intelligent path planning, which can adapt to
newly observed obstacles and can recover previous routes when obstructions are
removed. We validate LT-Exosense through several real-world experiments,
demonstrating a scalable multi-session map that achieves an average
point-to-point error below 5 cm when compared to ground-truth laser scans. We
also illustrate the potential application of adaptive path planning in
dynamically changing indoor environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型作为强大的机器人策略，能够泛化到不同场景和指令，但在模仿学习训练中对人类演示中的噪声（如抖动、暂停等）敏感，导致动作连贯性降低，在精细操作中造成不稳定和轨迹漂移。

Conclusion: ACG算法有效解决了VLA模型在模仿学习中因噪声导致的动作连贯性问题，显著提升了机器人操作的稳定性和成功率。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have emerged as powerful robot policies,
enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to generalize across diverse
scenes and instructions. Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high
generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations:
jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action
coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures
that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial.
In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a
training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and
thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and
real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts
success rates across diverse manipulation tasks. Code and project page are

### [570] [Bridging Perception and Reasoning: Dual-Pipeline Neuro-Symbolic Landing for UAVs in Cluttered Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22204)
*Weixian Qian,Sebastian Schroder,Yao Deng,Jiaohong Yao,Linfeng Liang,Xiao Cheng,Richard Han,Xi Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroSymLand是一个神经符号框架，结合了离线LLM合成符号知识和在线语义分割与符号推理，用于无人机在非结构化环境中的自主着陆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯视觉或深度学习模型在协变量偏移下表现不佳且缺乏可解释性，需要结合符号推理来提高无人机着陆的鲁棒性和可验证性。

Method: 采用双管道设计：离线管道使用LLM和人工精炼生成可验证的符号知识；在线管道通过语义分割生成概率事实，构建语义场景图进行实时演绎推理。

Result: 在多个数据集、仿真环境和真实无人机硬件上的评估显示，NeuroSymLand在准确性、鲁棒性和效率方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架将轻量级基础模型的感知能力与符号推理的可解释性相结合，显著提升了无人机在应急响应、监视和配送任务中的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous landing in unstructured (cluttered, uneven, and map-poor)
environments is a core requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet
purely vision-based or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift
and provide limited interpretability. We propose NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic
framework that tightly couples two complementary pipelines: (i) an offline
pipeline, where Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop refinement
synthesize Scallop code from diverse landing scenarios, distilling
generalizable and verifiable symbolic knowledge; and (ii) an online pipeline,
where a compact foundation-based semantic segmentation model generates
probabilistic Scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for
real-time deductive reasoning. This design combines the perceptual strengths of
lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of
symbolic reasoning. Node attributes (e.g., flatness, area) and edge relations
(adjacency, containment, proximity) are computed with geometric routines rather
than learned, avoiding the data dependence and latency of train-time graph
builders. The resulting Scallop program encodes landing principles (avoid water
and obstacles; prefer large, flat, accessible regions) and yields calibrated
safety scores with ranked Regions of Interest (ROIs) and human-readable
justifications. Extensive evaluations across datasets, diverse simulation maps,
and real UAV hardware show that NeuroSymLand achieves higher accuracy, stronger
robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared with
state-of-the-art baselines, while advancing UAV safety and reliability in
emergency response, surveillance, and delivery missions.

*Chen Zhiqiang,Le Gentil Cedric,Lin Fuling,Lu Minghao,Qiao Qiyuan,Xu Bowen,Qi Yuhua,Lu Peng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态感知的激光雷达惯性里程计方法，通过时空法向量分析和空间一致性验证来在动态环境中实现精确定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LIO方法在动态环境中表现不佳，特别是在几何稀疏场景中，动态物体主导时定位精度严重下降。现有方法面临一个循环依赖问题：精确定位需要可靠的静态特征识别，而区分动态物体又需要精确的位姿估计。

Method: 将动态感知直接集成到点云配准过程中，提出动态感知的迭代最近点算法，利用时空法向量分析，并辅以高效的空间一致性验证方法来增强静态地图构建。

Result: 在具有有限几何结构的挑战性动态环境中，相比最先进的LIO系统实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过打破循环依赖，在动态环境中实现了鲁棒且准确的激光雷达惯性里程计。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO) in
dynamic environments, where conventional methods often fail due to their
static-world assumptions. Traditional LIO algorithms perform poorly when
dynamic objects dominate the scenes, particularly in geometrically sparse
environments. Current approaches to dynamic LIO face a fundamental challenge:
accurate localization requires a reliable identification of static features,
yet distinguishing dynamic objects necessitates precise pose estimation. Our
solution breaks this circular dependency by integrating dynamic awareness
directly into the point cloud registration process. We introduce a novel
dynamic-aware iterative closest point algorithm that leverages spatio-temporal
normal analysis, complemented by an efficient spatial consistency verification
method to enhance static map construction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LIO systems in
challenging dynamic environments with limited geometric structure. The code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/thisparticle/btsa.

Conclusion: 人形机器人协同设计在提升跌倒恢复性能方面具有关键作用。

Abstract: Humanoid robots represent a central frontier in embodied intelligence, as
their anthropomorphic form enables natural deployment in humans' workspace.
Brain-body co-design for humanoids presents a promising approach to realizing
this potential by jointly optimizing control policies and physical morphology.
Within this context, fall recovery emerges as a critical capability. It not
only enhances safety and resilience but also integrates naturally with
locomotion systems, thereby advancing the autonomy of humanoids. In this paper,
we propose RoboCraft, a scalable humanoid co-design framework for fall recovery
that iteratively improves performance through the coupled updates of control
policy and morphology. A shared policy pretrained across multiple designs is
progressively finetuned on high-performing morphologies, enabling efficient
adaptation without retraining from scratch. Concurrently, morphology search is
guided by human-inspired priors and optimization algorithms, supported by a
priority buffer that balances reevaluation of promising candidates with the
exploration of novel designs. Experiments show that \ourmethod{} achieves an
average performance gain of 44.55% on seven public humanoid robots, with
morphology optimization drives at least 40% of improvements in co-designing
four humanoid robots, underscoring the critical role of humanoid co-design.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的柔性连续体机器人3D形状估计方法，通过融合多模态输入（肌腱位移数据和RGB图像）来生成表示机器人变形配置的点云，在加载条件下实现了高精度形状重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计柔性连续体机器人在外部载荷下的3D形状对于精确控制和操作至关重要，传统方法在加载条件下精度有限。

Method: 采用时空神经网络架构，融合多模态输入（当前和历史肌腱位移数据、RGB图像），包含循环神经网络模块用于时序特征提取、编码模块用于空间特征提取，以及多模态融合模块，通过拟合Bézier曲线实现连续3D形状重建。

Result: 实验验证显示该方法达到高精度，平均形状估计误差为0.08毫米（无负载）和0.22毫米（有负载），优于现有最先进的TDCR形状感知方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习为基础的时空数据融合方法在加载条件下实现了精确的形状估计，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for accurately estimating the
3D shape of flexible continuum robots subjected to external loads. The proposed
method introduces a spatiotemporal neural network architecture that fuses
multi-modal inputs, including current and historical tendon displacement data
and RGB images, to generate point clouds representing the robot's deformed
configuration. The network integrates a recurrent neural module for temporal
feature extraction, an encoding module for spatial feature extraction, and a
multi-modal fusion module to combine spatial features extracted from visual
data with temporal dependencies from historical actuator inputs. Continuous 3D
shape reconstruction is achieved by fitting B\'ezier curves to the predicted
point clouds. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
high precision, with mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and
0.22 mm (loaded), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in shape sensing for
TDCRs. The results validate the efficacy of deep learning-based spatiotemporal
data fusion for precise shape estimation under loading conditions.

*Seyed Ahmad Hosseini Miangoleh,Amin Jalal Aghdasian,Farzaneh Abdollahi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出BLIP-FusePPO框架，将视觉语言模型的语义嵌入与几何状态、LiDAR观测和PID控制反馈融合，用于自动驾驶车道保持任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用语义模型来塑造奖励，而本方法直接将语义特征嵌入状态表示，减少昂贵的运行时推理并确保语义指导始终可用。

Method: 通过融合语义、几何和控制感知表示来增强策略学习的鲁棒性，使用包含语义对齐、车道保持精度、障碍物避免和速度调节的混合奖励函数。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在多种困难驾驶场景下，该模型在车道保持稳定性和适应性方面优于最佳视觉和多模态强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: BLIP-FusePPO通过直接融合语义特征到状态表示，实现了更高效和可泛化的自动驾驶策略学习，代码已公开。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining-driven
Fused State Representation in Proximal Policy Optimization (BLIP-FusePPO), a
novel multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous
lane-keeping (LK), in which semantic embeddings generated by a vision-language
model (VLM) are directly fused with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and
Proportional-Integral-Derivative-based (PID) control feedback within the agent
observation space. The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that
are aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level
scene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals.
Our architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware
representations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function
that includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed
regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable. Our method is
different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards.
Instead, it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation.
This cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic
guidance is always available. The simulation results show that the proposed
model is better at LK stability and adaptability than the best vision-based and
multimodal RL baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations. We
make our code publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MTLHRL框架通过分层强化学习和李雅普诺夫约束，解决了高维随机系统的控制问题，在稳定性和性能上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维随机系统控制中的维度灾难、缺乏时间抽象和随机稳定性不足等问题，这些在机器人、自动驾驶和超混沌系统中尤为关键。

Method: 采用半马尔可夫决策过程的分层策略，包含高层策略进行战略规划，低层策略进行反应控制；通过神经李雅普诺夫函数、拉格朗日松弛和多时间尺度actor-critic更新来确保稳定性。

Result: 在8D超混沌系统和5-DOF机器人上的实验表明，MTLHRL在稳定性和性能上显著优于基线方法，获得最低误差指标（超混沌控制IAE: 3.912，机器人IAE: 1.623），收敛更快且具有优越的抗干扰能力。

Conclusion: MTLHRL为复杂随机系统的鲁棒控制提供了理论严谨且实际可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional stochastic systems, critical in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and hyperchaotic systems, faces the curse of
dimensionality, lacks temporal abstraction, and often fails to ensure
stochastic stability. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces the
Multi-Timescale Lyapunov-Constrained Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
(MTLHRL) framework. MTLHRL integrates a hierarchical policy within a
semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), featuring a high-level policy for
strategic planning and a low-level policy for reactive control, which
effectively manages complex, multi-timescale decision-making and reduces
dimensionality overhead. Stability is rigorously enforced using a neural
Lyapunov function optimized via Lagrangian relaxation and multi-timescale
actor-critic updates, ensuring mean-square boundedness or asymptotic stability
in the face of stochastic dynamics. The framework promotes efficient and
reliable learning through trust-region constraints and decoupled optimization.
Extensive simulations on an 8D hyperchaotic system and a 5-DOF robotic
manipulator demonstrate MTLHRL's empirical superiority. It significantly
outperforms baseline methods in both stability and performance, recording the
lowest error indices (e.g., Integral Absolute Error (IAE): 3.912 in
hyperchaotic control and IAE: 1.623 in robotics), achieving faster convergence,
and exhibiting superior disturbance rejection. MTLHRL offers a theoretically
grounded and practically viable solution for robust control of complex
stochastic systems.

Abstract: Social Robot Navigation is the skill that allows robots to move efficiently
in human-populated environments while ensuring safety, comfort, and trust.
Unlike other areas of research, the scientific community has not yet achieved
an agreement on how Social Robot Navigation should be benchmarked. This is
notably important, as the lack of a de facto standard to benchmark Social Robot
Navigation can hinder the progress of the field and may lead to contradicting
conclusions. Motivated by this gap, we contribute with a short review focused
exclusively on benchmarking trends in the period from January 2020 to July
2025. Of the 130 papers identified by our search using IEEE Xplore, we analysed
the 85 papers that met the criteria of the review. This review addresses the
metrics used in the literature for benchmarking purposes, the algorithms
employed in such benchmarks, the use of human surveys for benchmarking, and how
conclusions are drawn from the benchmarking results, when applicable.

*Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种为通用Stewart平台生成可行、唯一正向运动学解的方法，使用逆运动学获取有效工作空间数据，通过改进的Denavit-Hartenberg约定实现简单迭代算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stewart平台等并联运动机构的逆运动学简单，但正向运动学复杂且产生多解，需要手动验证，这限制了其在六自由度材料测试系统中的应用。

Method: 使用改进的Denavit-Hartenberg约定的简单迭代算法，通过逆运动学获取有效工作空间数据和对应的执行器长度。

Result: 该方法为每个有效位姿生成单一可行的正向运动学解，无需手动验证，可直接用于进一步计算。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了Stewart平台正向运动学的多解问题，为六自由度材料测试系统提供了可靠的运动学解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a method to generate feasible, unique forward-kinematic
solutions for a general Stewart platform. This is done by using inverse
kinematics to obtain valid workspace data and corresponding actuator lengths
for the moving platform. For parallel kinematic machines, such as the Stewart
Platform, inverse kinematics are straight forward, but the forward kinematics
are complex and generates multiple solutions due to the closed loop structure
of the kinematic links. In this research, a simple iterative algorithm has been
used employing modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention. The outcome is
encouraging as this method generates a single feasible forward kinematic
solution for each valid pose with the solved DH parameters and unlike earlier
forward kinematics solutions, this unique solution does not need to be manually
verified. Therefore, the forward kinematic solutions can be used directly for
further calculations without the need for manual pose verification. This
capability is essential for the six degree of freedom materials testing system
developed by the authors in their laboratory. The developed system is aimed at
characterizing additively manufactured materials under complex combined
multiple loading conditions. The material characterization is done by enabling
high precision force control on the moving platform via in situ calibration of
the as-built kinematics of the Stewart Gough Platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文研究了藤蔓机器人在不同设计参数和控制选择下的转向性能，发现尖端负载、压力、长度、直径和制造方法都会影响其转向能力，并提出了优化原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 藤蔓机器人虽然在复杂环境中具有应用潜力，但其性能受到附加传感器重量、设计参数和控制选择的限制，需要系统研究这些因素如何影响转向性能。

Method: 进行两组实验：第一组研究尖端负载、腔室压力、长度和直径对机器人抗重力支撑的影响；第二组研究制造方法和执行器与腔室压力比在地面支撑机器人中的影响。

Result: 转向性能随尖端负载增加而降低，在中等腔室压力下最佳，随长度增加而提高，基本不受直径影响。外置执行器在低压比时开始弯曲但饱和，集成执行器需要更高压力但能达到更大曲率。

Conclusion: 基于这些优化原则设计的机器人在涉及最大化向上和水平曲率的移动任务中表现优于随意参数设置的机器人。

Abstract: Vine robots extend their tubular bodies by everting material from the tip,
enabling navigation in complex environments with a minimalist soft body.
Despite their promise for field applications, especially in the urban search
and rescue domain, performance is constrained by the weight of attached sensors
or tools, as well as other design and control choices. This work investigates
how tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method shape vine
robot steerability--the ability to maneuver with controlled curvature--for
robots that steer with series pouch motor-style pneumatic actuators. We conduct
two groups of experiments: (1) studying tip load, chamber pressure, length, and
diameter in a robot supporting itself against gravity, and (2) studying
fabrication method and ratio of actuator to chamber pressure in a robot
supported on the ground. Results show that steerability decreases with
increasing tip load, is best at moderate chamber pressure, increases with
length, and is largely unaffected by diameter. Robots with actuators attached
on their exterior begin curving at low pressure ratios, but curvature saturates
at high pressure ratios; those with actuators integrated into the robot body
require higher pressure ratios to begin curving but achieve higher curvature
overall. We demonstrate that robots optimized with these principles outperform
those with ad hoc parameters in a mobility task that involves maximizing upward
and horizontal curvatures.

TL;DR: 研究显示，当机器人表现出对人类价值观的理解时，它们对人类决策的影响更大。参与者更关注价值感知型机器人，并认为其更忠诚。当两个机器人都反对参与者时，约四分之一的情况会发生从众行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究机器人是否在表现出对人类价值观的理解时，能更有效地影响人类决策，以及这种影响可能带来的伦理风险和社会效益。

Method: 设计实验让参与者与两个Furhat机器人互动：一个被编程为价值感知型，另一个为非价值感知型。在图像标注任务中观察参与者的选择、注视行为和决策时间。

Result: 参与者能区分两种机器人类型；虽然明确选择没有明显偏好，但参与者更关注价值感知型机器人；价值感知型机器人被认为更忠诚；当两个机器人都反对参与者时，25%的情况发生从众行为，且决策时间更长。

Conclusion: 机器人的价值感知能力能增强其社会影响力，既可能被滥用于操纵用户，也可能在模糊情境中促使用户反思，帮助避免欺诈。

Abstract: This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more
likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as
value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We
designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots
- one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a
labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that
participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one.
Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one
robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the
Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more
loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its
perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the
participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and
participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots
expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand,
this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate
users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that
social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users
avoid scams.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In natural systems, emergent structures often arise to balance competing
demands. Army ants, for example, form temporary "walls" that prevent
interference between foraging trails. Inspired by this behavior, we developed
two decentralized controllers for heterogeneous robotic swarms to maintain
spatial separation while executing concurrent tasks. The first is a
finite-state machine (FSM)-based controller that uses encounter-triggered
transitions to create rigid, stable walls. The second integrates FSM states
with a Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamically optimizing separation through emergent
"demilitarized zones." In simulation, both controllers reduce mixing between
subgroups, with the DQN-enhanced controller improving adaptability and reducing
mixing by 40-50% while achieving faster convergence.

Motivation: 传统3DGS SLAM在视觉输入受噪声和低光照影响时可靠性严重受限，现有的3DGS SLAM框架在干净条件下能达到高保真度映射，但在复合退化条件下仍然脆弱，影响映射和跟踪性能。

Result: 在Replica、TUM和真实世界序列上的综合实验表明，RoGER-SLAM相比其他3DGS-SLAM系统持续提高了轨迹精度和重建质量，特别是在恶劣成像条件下。

Conclusion: RoGER-SLAM通过创新的融合机制、自适应跟踪和语义增强，有效解决了3DGS SLAM在噪声和低光照环境中的脆弱性问题，为恶劣条件下的SLAM提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The reliability of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is severely
constrained in environments where visual inputs suffer from noise and low
illumination. Although recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based SLAM
frameworks achieve high-fidelity mapping under clean conditions, they remain
vulnerable to compounded degradations that degrade mapping and tracking
performance. A key observation underlying our work is that the original 3DGS
rendering pipeline inherently behaves as an implicit low-pass filter,
attenuating high-frequency noise but also risking over-smoothing. Building on
this insight, we propose RoGER-SLAM, a robust 3DGS SLAM system tailored for
noise and low-light resilience. The framework integrates three innovations: a
Structure-Preserving Robust Fusion (SP-RoFusion) mechanism that couples
rendered appearance, depth, and edge cues; an adaptive tracking objective with
residual balancing regularization; and a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP)-based enhancement module, selectively activated under compounded
degradations to restore semantic and structural fidelity. Comprehensive
experiments on Replica, TUM, and real-world sequences show that RoGER-SLAM
consistently improves trajectory accuracy and reconstruction quality compared
with other 3DGS-SLAM systems, especially under adverse imaging conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶感知系统在面对罕见事件或样本外数据时容易产生过度自信的预测错误，需要让车辆具备'知道何时不确定'的能力。

Method: 使用随机集神经网络作为不确定性感知图像分类器，预测类别集的置信函数，并将其集成到基于ROS的自动驾驶赛车软件栈中，根据预测不确定性动态调节车辆速度。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知神经网络，特别是RS-NNs，是实现更安全、更鲁棒自动驾驶的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception systems have advanced rapidly in recent
years, providing vehicles with the ability to accurately interpret their
environment. Perception systems remain susceptible to errors caused by
overly-confident predictions in the case of rare events or out-of-sample data.
This study equips an autonomous vehicle with the ability to 'know when it is
uncertain', using an uncertainty-aware image classifier as part of the AV
software stack. Specifically, the study exploits the ability of Random-Set
Neural Networks (RS-NNs) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty. Unlike
traditional CNNs or Bayesian methods, RS-NNs predict belief functions over sets
of classes, allowing the system to identify and signal uncertainty clearly in
novel or ambiguous scenarios. The system is tested in a real-world autonomous
racing vehicle software stack, with the RS-NN classifying the layout of the
road ahead and providing the associated uncertainty of the prediction.
Performance of the RS-NN under a range of road conditions is compared against
traditional CNN and Bayesian neural networks, with the RS-NN achieving
significantly higher accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration. This
integration of RS-NNs into Robot Operating System (ROS)-based vehicle control
pipeline demonstrates that predictive uncertainty can dynamically modulate
vehicle speed, maintaining high-speed performance under confident predictions
while proactively improving safety through speed reductions in uncertain
scenarios. These results demonstrate the potential of uncertainty-aware neural
networks - in particular RS-NNs - as a practical solution for safer and more
robust autonomous driving.

model-free baselines. Our investigation focuses on 3D proximity maneuvering
tasks around targets such as the Lunar Gateway and other space assets. We
evaluate task performance under two complementary regimes: generalized agents
trained on randomized velocity vectors, and specialized agents trained to
follow fixed trajectories emulating known inspection orbits. Furthermore, we
assess the robustness and generalization of policies across multiple spacecraft
morphologies and mission domains. Results demonstrate that model-based RL
offers promising capabilities in trajectory fidelity, and sample efficiency,
paving the way for scalable, retrainable control solutions for future space
operations

### [584] [Analytical Swarm Chemistry: Characterization and Analysis of Emergent Swarm Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22821)
*Ricardo Vega,Connor Mattson,Kevin Zhu,Daniel S. Brown,Cameron Nowzari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了Analytical Swarm Chemistry框架，将工程学、基于代理的研究和人工生命研究相结合，通过宏观状态定义和相图分析来系统探索群体参数如何影响涌现行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体机器人学在现实世界部署稀少，因为难以预测简单局部交互产生的涌现行为。传统工程方法在理想条件下设计控制器，而基于代理的研究则自下而上探索涌现现象。

Method: 结合工程学、基于代理研究和人工生命研究的概念，引入化学中的概念，将参数视为热力学变量，可视化参数空间中产生特定行为的区域。

Result: 在具有最小可行能力的代理上应用该框架，识别了产生铣削和扩散等行为的充分条件，并发现了可靠产生这些行为的参数空间区域。初步真实机器人验证表明这些区域在实践中对应可观察行为。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界群体系统中可预测和可靠的涌现行为奠定了基础，提供了一种原则性、可解释的方法。

Abstract: Swarm robotics has potential for a wide variety of applications, but
real-world deployments remain rare due to the difficulty of predicting emergent
behaviors arising from simple local interactions. Traditional engineering
approaches design controllers to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes under
idealized conditions, while agent-based and artificial life studies explore
emergent phenomena in a bottom-up, exploratory manner. In this work, we
introduce Analytical Swarm Chemistry, a framework that integrates concepts from
engineering, agent-based and artificial life research, and chemistry. This
framework combines macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis to
systematically explore how swarm parameters influence emergent behavior.
Inspired by concepts from chemistry, the framework treats parameters like
thermodynamic variables, enabling visualization of regions in parameter space
that give rise to specific behaviors. Applying this framework to agents with
minimally viable capabilities, we identify sufficient conditions for behaviors
such as milling and diffusion and uncover regions of the parameter space that
reliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary validation on real robots
demonstrates that these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice.
By providing a principled, interpretable approach, this framework lays the
groundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm
systems.

*Wentao Guo,Wenzeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了两种环境自适应夹持手指设计：SCAL-R（旋转驱动）和SCAL-L（线性驱动），通过槽约束自适应连杆实现无需复杂传感和控制的薄型物体夹持提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统夹持器在夹持薄型、低剖面物体时需要精确传感和控制的挑战，开发能够适应环境变化的自适应夹持机制。

Method: 基于槽约束自适应连杆(SCAL)设计两种互补手指：SCAL-R通过旋转驱动主动折叠形成包络，SCAL-L通过线性驱动被动展开以夹持宽大或弱特征物体。两种设计都将表面跟随转换为向上提升动作。

Result: 实验验证了两种设计在桌面滑动夹持、斜坡协商提升以及大物体处理方面的有效性，在数十次试验中对小零件、盒子、罐子和胶带卷等物体实现了一致的夹持效果。

Conclusion: 两种设计具有互补的操作机制，为使用简单驱动的鲁棒环境自适应夹持提供了实用路径，准静态分析提供了几何感知的设计和操作指导。

Abstract: This paper presents environment-adaptive pinch-lifting built on a
slot-constrained adaptive linkage (SCAL) and instantiated in two complementary
fingers: SCAL-R, a rotational-drive design with an active fingertip that folds
inward after contact to form an envelope, and SCAL-L, a linear-drive design
that passively opens on contact to span wide or weak-feature objects. Both
fingers convert surface following into an upward lifting branch while
maintaining fingertip orientation, enabling thin or low-profile targets to be
raised from supports with minimal sensing and control. Two-finger grippers are
fabricated via PLA-based 3D printing. Experiments evaluate (i)
contact-preserving sliding and pinch-lifting on tabletops, (ii) ramp
negotiation followed by lift, and (iii) handling of bulky objects via active
enveloping (SCAL-R) or contact-triggered passive opening (SCAL-L). Across
dozens of trials on small parts, boxes, jars, and tape rolls, both designs
achieve consistent grasps with limited tuning. A quasi-static analysis provides
closed-form fingertip-force models for linear parallel pinching and two-point
enveloping, offering geometry-aware guidance for design and operation. Overall,
the results indicate complementary operating regimes and a practical path to
robust, environment-adaptive grasping with simple actuation.

TL;DR: 提出自适应虚拟模型控制(AVMC)，结合大语言模型(LLM)和李雅普诺夫强化学习(RL)，在保持物理可解释性的同时实现稳定性保证的在线适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人控制方法在不确定环境中变得僵化脆弱，虚拟模型控制(VMC)虽然能实现柔顺行为，但依赖固定参数且虚拟组件间协调有限，限制了适应性和稳定性

Method: 将LLM用于提供结构化先验和高级推理以增强虚拟组件协调，结合李雅普诺夫RL强制执行理论稳定性约束，实现安全可靠的在线适应

Result: 在7自由度Panda机械臂上的大量仿真表明，该方法在动态任务中有效平衡了竞争目标，实现了优越性能

Conclusion: LLM指导与李雅普诺夫约束适应的协同效益显著，为机器人控制提供了新的自适应解决方案

Abstract: Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet
conventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to
perturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables
compliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint
torques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among
virtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task
objectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive VMC with
Large Language Model (LLM)- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL),
which preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting
stability-guaranteed online adaptation. The LLM provides structured priors and
high-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components,
improve sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task
requirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability
constraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive
simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively
balances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance
while highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and
Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.

Abstract: This paper presents the complete design, control, and experimental validation
of a low-cost Stewart platform prototype developed as an affordable yet capable
robotic testbed for research and education. The platform combines off the shelf
components with 3D printed and custom fabricated parts to deliver full six
degrees of freedom motions using six linear actuators connecting a moving
platform to a fixed base. The system software integrates dynamic modeling, data
acquisition, and real time control within a unified framework. A robust
trajectory tracking controller based on feedback linearization, augmented with
an LQR scheme, compensates for the platform's nonlinear dynamics to achieve
precise motion control. In parallel, an Extended Kalman Filter fuses IMU and
actuator encoder feedback to provide accurate and reliable state estimation
under sensor noise and external disturbances. Unlike prior efforts that
emphasize only isolated aspects such as modeling or control, this work delivers
a complete hardware-software platform validated through both simulation and
experiments on static and dynamic trajectories. Results demonstrate effective
trajectory tracking and real-time state estimation, highlighting the platform's
potential as a cost effective and versatile tool for advanced research and
educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在具有重复结构（如走廊和房间）的相似室内环境中，基于点云的多智能体协同SLAM技术往往难以准确识别共享位置，导致定位精度下降。

Method: TWC-SLAM包含基于FAST-LIO2的单智能体前端里程计模块、利用文本语义和WiFi特征的位置识别与闭环检测模块，以及全局建图模块。智能体装备能捕获文本信息和检测WiFi信号的传感器。

Result: 在具有相似走廊、房间和文本标志的室内数据集上测试，结果显示TWC-SLAM在具有重复建筑特征的复杂环境中显著提升了协同SLAM系统的性能。

Conclusion: TWC-SLAM通过整合文本语义和WiFi信号特征，有效解决了多智能体协同SLAM在重复结构环境中的位置识别问题，提高了系统的整体性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative SLAM often encounters challenges in similar indoor
environments characterized by repetitive structures, such as corridors and
rooms. These challenges can lead to significant inaccuracies in shared location
identification when employing point cloud-based techniques. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce TWC-SLAM, a multi-agent cooperative SLAM framework that
integrates text semantics and WiFi signal features to enhance location
identification and loop closure detection. TWC-SLAM comprises a single-agent
front-end odometry module based on FAST-LIO2, a location identification and
loop closure detection module that leverages text semantics and WiFi features,
and a global mapping module. The agents are equipped with sensors capable of
capturing textual information and detecting WiFi signals. By correlating these
data sources, TWC-SLAM establishes a common location, facilitating point cloud
alignment across different agents' maps. Furthermore, the system employs loop
closure detection and optimization modules to achieve global optimization and
cohesive mapping. We evaluated our approach using an indoor dataset featuring
similar corridors, rooms, and text signs. The results demonstrate that TWC-SLAM
significantly improves the performance of cooperative SLAM systems in complex
environments with repetitive architectural features.

water use and poor terrain adaptability. The system integrates advanced
computer vision, robotic control, and real-time stabilization technologies via
a multi-sensor fusion approach. A lightweight YOLO model, deployed on an
embedded vision processor (K210), enables real-time plant container detection
with over 96% accuracy under varying lighting conditions. A simplified hand-eye
calibration algorithm-designed for 'handheld camera' robot arm
configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with
a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the
STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can
stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response
time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural

a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood
irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PIP-LLM是一个基于语言的多机器人协调框架，通过团队级PDDL规划和机器人级整数规划来解决自然语言指令的多机器人任务执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多机器人协调中存在任务分解脆弱、可扩展性差和协调效率低的问题，需要更有效的多机器人规划框架。

Method: 采用两级规划：首先将自然语言指令转换为团队级PDDL问题并求解，获得抽象的任务计划；然后将计划转换为依赖图，使用整数规划进行机器人级任务分配，优化旅行成本和工作负载。

Result: 实验表明PIP-LLM相比现有方法提高了计划成功率，降低了最大和平均旅行成本，并实现了更好的负载均衡。

Conclusion: PIP-LLM通过分离规划和分配，避免了基于语法的分解陷阱，能够扩展到更大的团队规模，在多机器人任务执行中表现出色。

Abstract: Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires
translating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description
Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches
struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor
scalability, and low coordination efficiency.
  We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists
of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based
robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the
command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level
plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a
subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a
dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a
dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each
subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem,
explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot
capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from
assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition
and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM
improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and
achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将端到端导航扩展到腿式机器人，开发更通用和具有时间感知能力的系统，通过整合多模态感知和时序信息来提升导航性能。

Method: 使用EfficientNet-B0编码器减少计算量，联合预测语义分割和深度估计，通过连续GNSS位置直接计算航向角替代噪声IMU，采用序列输入进行时间融合。

Result: 在机器人狗上验证，序列输入提升了感知和控制性能，与其他基线相比表现更好，在开放区域GNSS航向估计稳健，模型大小合理且结果具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Seq-DeepIPC成功将端到端导航扩展到腿式机器人，展示了时序融合和多模态感知在复杂环境导航中的有效性，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model
for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances
intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating
multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The
model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving
richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on
edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while
maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy
IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS
positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both
road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative
and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control
in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves
competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only
heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas.
Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to
more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we
will release the codes to our GitHub repository at
https://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC.

Conclusion: 该系统为动态机器人平台上的高性能碰撞感知规划提供了稳健基础，能够处理具有挑战性的环境场景。

Abstract: Accurate full-body motion prediction is essential for the safe, autonomous
navigation of legged robots, enabling critical capabilities like limb-level
collision checking in cluttered environments. Simplified kinematic models often
fail to capture the complex, closed-loop dynamics of the robot and its
low-level controller, limiting their predictions to simple planar motion. To
address this, we present a learning-based observer-predictor framework that
accurately predicts this motion. Our method features a neural observer with
provable UUB guarantees that provides a reliable latent state estimate from a
history of proprioceptive measurements. This stable estimate initializes a
computationally efficient predictor, designed for the rapid, parallel
evaluation of thousands of potential trajectories required by modern
sampling-based planners. We validated the system by integrating our neural
predictor into an MPPI-based planner on a Vision 60 quadruped. Hardware
experiments successfully demonstrated effective, limb-aware motion planning in
a challenging, narrow passage and over small objects, highlighting our system's
ability to provide a robust foundation for high-performance, collision-aware
planning on dynamic robotic platforms.

Conclusion: 该框架的模块化结构保证了计算可行性和灵活性，适用于复杂现实工业场景部署。

Abstract: The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial
environments requires scalable coordination of large fleets in dynamic
settings. This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level
scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the
compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for
each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive
Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories,
accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe,
collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to
disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the
method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic
conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even
under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for
computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment
in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增加缆绳数量会带来两个问题：缆绳干扰显著减小旋转工作空间，以及缆绳张力解不唯一导致运动控制困难。

Method: 设计包含弹簧、螺旋槽轴、匹配螺母和轴承的可重构末端执行器，将组件间的相对线性运动转换为相对旋转运动，并引入额外旋转自由度。

Conclusion: 所提出的可重构末端执行器设计有效解决了缆绳机器人工作空间受限和控制复杂的问题，实现了更简单可靠的运动控制。

Abstract: To enlarge the translational workspace of cable-driven robots, one common
approach is to increase the number of cables. However, this introduces two
challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational
workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique,
resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we
design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By
incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative
linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative
rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism.
Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree
of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion
can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing
and control.

Conclusion: 混合感知方法对导航性能有显著贡献，消融研究证明局部和全局感知中的任一部分都对导航性能有积极作用

Abstract: Objective-oriented navigation(ObjNav) enables robot to navigate to target
object directly and autonomously in an unknown environment. Effective
perception in navigation in unknown environment is critical for autonomous
robots. While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local
information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav.
Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom
integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact
that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of
Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation
(HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding
capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance
the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In
both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods
achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting
from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the
objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information
understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map. Our ablation
study further proved that either of the hybrid perception contributes to the
navigation performance.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in robot
bimanual skill learning. However, existing methods ignore the learning of
posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm
configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous
bimanual manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose
Manipulability-Aware Diffusion Policy (ManiDP), a novel imitation learning
method that not only generates plausible bimanual trajectories, but also
optimizes dual-arm configurations to better satisfy posture-dependent task
requirements. ManiDP achieves this by extracting bimanual manipulability from
expert demonstrations and encoding the encapsulated posture features using
Riemannian-based probabilistic models. These encoded posture features are then
incorporated into a conditional diffusion process to guide the generation of
task-compatible bimanual motion sequences. We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world
bimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33$\%$ increase
in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task
compatibility compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the importance
of integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion to
enable human-like adaptability and dexterity.

Abstract: The facial expression generation capability of humanoid social robots is
critical for achieving natural and human-like interactions, playing a vital
role in enhancing the fluidity of human-robot interactions and the accuracy of
emotional expression. Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid
social robots still relies on pre-programmed behavioral patterns, which are
manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to
autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop
the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address
this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with
physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning
framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms.
Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an
automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion

*Sunyou Hwang,Christophe De Wagter,Bart Remes,Guido de Croon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出SAOS控制切换方法，通过选择性控制水平或垂直轴来减少滑翔中的盘旋行为，提高能量效率和飞行稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地形滑翔可延长微型飞行器续航时间，但盘旋行为会增加能耗和发散风险，需要解决控制冲突问题

Method: 采用控制切换方法，将系统从欠驱动转变为全驱动状态，并在INDI控制器中加入攻角来改进力估计

Result: 仿真和风洞实验表明，SAOS改善了位置收敛，减少了油门使用，缓解了俯仰-滚转耦合引起的滚转振荡

Conclusion: SAOS方法在受限滑翔环境中提高了能量效率和飞行稳定性

Abstract: Orographic soaring can significantly extend the endurance of micro aerial
vehicles (MAVs), but circling behavior, arising from control conflicts between
the longitudinal and vertical axes, increases energy consumption and the risk
of divergence. We propose a control switching method, named SAOS: Switched
Control for Autonomous Orographic Soaring, which mitigates circling behavior by
selectively controlling either the horizontal or vertical axis, effectively
transforming the system from underactuated to fully actuated during soaring.
Additionally, the angle of attack is incorporated into the INDI controller to
improve force estimation. Simulations with randomized initial positions and
wind tunnel experiments on two MAVs demonstrate that the SAOS improves position
convergence, reduces throttle usage, and mitigates roll oscillations caused by
pitch-roll coupling. These improvements enhance energy efficiency and flight
stability in constrained soaring environments.

Conclusion: 该系统能够处理紧凑复杂形状，实现了成本效益与工艺控制的平衡。

Abstract: This paper deals with the design of a cost effective automated tape laying
system (ATL system) with integrated uniaxial force control to ensure the
necessary compaction forces as well as with an accurate temperature control to
guarantee the used tape being melted appropriate. It is crucial to control the
substrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an
optimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore,
it takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is
finally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into
the tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a
heating zone and the consolidation unit. Moreover, a special robot control
concept for testing the ATL system is presented. In contrast to many other
systems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the
shape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather
compact and complex shapes. The functionality of the subsystems and the taping
process itself was finally approved in experimental results using a carbon
fiber reinforced HDPE tape.

Abstract: Enabling robots to dexterously grasp and manipulate objects based on human
commands is a promising direction in robotics. However, existing approaches are
challenging to generalize across diverse objects or tasks due to the limited
scale of semantic dexterous grasp datasets. Foundation models offer a new way
to enhance generalization, yet directly leveraging them to generate feasible
robotic actions remains challenging due to the gap between abstract model
knowledge and physical robot execution. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDexGrasp, a generalizable framework that achieves omni-capabilities in user
prompting, dexterous embodiment, and grasping tasks by combining foundation
models with the transfer and control strategies. OmniDexGrasp integrates three
key modules: (i) foundation models are used to enhance generalization by
generating human grasp images supporting omni-capability of user prompt and
task; (ii) a human-image-to-robot-action transfer strategy converts human
demonstrations into executable robot actions, enabling omni dexterous
embodiment; (iii) force-aware adaptive grasp strategy ensures robust and stable
grasp execution. Experiments in simulation and on real robots validate the
effectiveness of OmniDexGrasp on diverse user prompts, grasp task and dexterous
hands, and further results show its extensibility to dexterous manipulation
tasks.

Result: 在门把手抓取和物体放置两个场景中的实验表明，集成异常检测和恢复的系统在各种异常情况下显著提高了执行成功率。

Conclusion: 将策略执行与异常检测和恢复相结合，能够有效提高机器人在存在各种异常环境中的执行可靠性。

Abstract: Learned robot policies have consistently been shown to be versatile, but they
typically have no built-in mechanism for handling the complexity of open
environments, making them prone to execution failures; this implies that
deploying policies without the ability to recognise and react to failures may
lead to unreliable and unsafe robot behaviour. In this paper, we present a
framework that couples a learned policy with a method to detect visual
anomalies during policy deployment and to perform recovery behaviours when
necessary, thereby aiming to prevent failures. Specifically, we train an
anomaly detection model using data collected during nominal executions of a
trained policy. This model is then integrated into the online policy execution
process, so that deviations from the nominal execution can trigger a
three-level sequential recovery process that consists of (i) pausing the
execution temporarily, (ii) performing a local perturbation of the robot's
state, and (iii) resetting the robot to a safe state by sampling from a learned
execution success model. We verify our proposed method in two different
scenarios: (i) a door handle reaching task with a Kinova Gen3 arm using a
policy trained in simulation and transferred to the real robot, and (ii) an
object placing task with a UFactory xArm 6 using a general-purpose policy
model. Our results show that integrating policy execution with anomaly
detection and recovery increases the execution success rate in environments
with various anomalies, such as trajectory deviations and adversarial human
interventions.

Abstract: Fixed-frequency control in robotics imposes a trade-off between the
efficiency of low-frequency control and the robustness of high-frequency
control, a limitation not seen in adaptable biological systems. We address this
with a reinforcement learning approach in which policies jointly select control
actions and their application durations, enabling robots to autonomously
modulate their control frequency in response to situational demands. We
validate our method with zero-shot sim-to-real experiments on two distinct
hardware platforms: a high-speed RC car and a quadrupedal robot. Our method
matches or outperforms fixed-frequency baselines in terms of rewards while
significantly reducing the control frequency and exhibiting adaptive frequency
control under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人设计优化提供了基础，能够综合考虑重量、振动和寿命要求，实现可持续的工业自动化。

Abstract: Resourceful operation and design of robots is key for sustainable industrial
automation. This will be enabled by lightweight design along with time and
energy optimal control of robotic manipulators. Design and control of such
systems is intertwined as the control must take into account inherent
mechanical compliance while the design must accommodate the dynamic
requirements demanded by the control. As basis for such design optimization, a
method for estimating the lifetime of elastic link robotic manipulators is
presented. This is applied to the geometry optimization of flexible serial
manipulators performing pick-and-place operations, where the optimization
objective is a combination of overall weight and vibration amplitudes. The
lifetime estimation draws from a fatigue analysis combining the rainflow
counting algorithm and the method of critical cutting plane. Tresca hypothesis
is used to formulate an equivalent stress, and linear damage accumulation is
assumed. The final robot geometry is selected from a Pareto front as a tradeoff
of lifetime and vibration characteristic. The method is illustrated for a three
degrees of freedom articulated robotic manipulator.

Conclusion: 基于期望自由能最小化的主动推理能够有效统一现实世界机器人环境中的探索和目标导向导航。

Abstract: Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration
to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in
order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the
free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by
minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and
extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework
that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale
recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy
generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their
long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection
that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our
framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the
baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results
highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and
goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.

Motivation: 解决多传感器系统中时间同步的挑战，特别是水下集成导航系统中声学定位对时间延迟的高度敏感性，避免测量和融合时刻不对齐导致的精度下降问题。

Method: 采用紧密耦合导航框架，融合piUSBL的方位角和斜距数据与深度数据；引入新颖的延迟测量策略，结合同步定时和声学信号处理，将延迟重新定义为可量化参数；通过显式估计声学传播和系统处理延迟来实现补偿。

Conclusion: 精确的延迟测量和补偿不仅提高了水下导航精度，还为声学定位集成建立了一个可推广的框架，为延迟敏感的多传感器系统中的时间对齐和数据融合提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In multi-sensor systems, time synchronization between sensors is a
significant challenge, and this issue is particularly pronounced in underwater
integrated navigation systems incorporating acoustic positioning. Such systems
are highly susceptible to time delay, which can significantly degrade accuracy
when measurement and fusion moments are misaligned. To address this challenge,
this paper introduces a tightly coupled navigation framework that integrates a
passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) acoustic positioning system, a
strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), and a depth gauge under precise
time synchronization. The framework fuses azimuth and slant range from the
piUSBL with depth data, thereby avoiding poor vertical-angle observability in
planar arrays. A novel delay measurement strategy is introduced, combining
synchronized timing with acoustic signal processing, which redefines
delay-traditionally an unobservable error-into a quantifiable parameter,
enabling explicit estimation of both acoustic propagation and system processing
delays. Simulations and field experiments confirm the feasibility of the
proposed method, with delay-compensated navigation reducing RMSE by 40.45% and
maximum error by 32.55%. These findings show that precise delay measurement and
compensation not only enhance underwater navigation accuracy but also establish
a generalizable framework for acoustic positioning integration, offering
valuable insights into time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive
multi-sensor systems.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments is essential for field and
planetary robotics, where robots must efficiently reach goals while avoiding
obstacles under uncertain conditions. Conventional algorithmic approaches often
require extensive environment-specific tuning, limiting scalability to new
domains. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides a data-driven alternative,
allowing robots to acquire navigation strategies through direct interactions
with their environment. This work investigates the feasibility of DRL policy
generalization across visually and topographically distinct simulated domains,
where policies are trained in terrestrial settings and validated in a zero-shot
manner in extraterrestrial environments. A 3D simulation of an agricultural
rover is developed and trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to
achieve goal-directed navigation and obstacle avoidance in farmland settings.
The learned policy is then evaluated in a lunar-like simulated environment to
assess transfer performance. The results indicate that policies trained under
terrestrial conditions retain a high level of effectiveness, achieving close to
50\% success in lunar simulations without the need for additional training and
fine-tuning. This underscores the potential of cross-domain DRL-based policy
transfer as a promising approach to developing adaptable and efficient
autonomous navigation for future planetary exploration missions, with the added
benefit of minimizing retraining costs.

then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service
robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and
decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning
across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio,

current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning
capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments.
This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the inconsistency problem
caused by observability mismatch in visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS).
The key idea involves applying a linear time-varying transformation to the
error-state within the Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). This transformation
ensures that \textrr{the unobservable subspace of the transformed error-state
system} becomes independent of the state, thereby preserving the correct
observability of the transformed system against variations in linearization
points. We introduce the Transformed ESKF (T-ESKF), a consistent VINS estimator
that performs state estimation using the transformed error-state system.
Furthermore, we develop an efficient propagation technique to accelerate the
covariance propagation based on the transformation relationship between the
transition and accumulated matrices of T-ESKF and ESKF. We validate the
proposed method through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating
better (or competitive at least) performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at github.com/HITCSC/T-ESKF.

Abstract: Heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators (HHMs) operate under strict physical and
safety-critical constraints due to their large size, high power, and complex
nonlinear dynamics. Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector
trajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force,
velocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation,
yet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper
presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to
guarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of
HHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed
method combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback,
and is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual
decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation
on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only
enforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures
constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These
results demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory
tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new
benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.

Abstract: To understand and collaborate with humans, robots must account for individual
human traits, habits, and activities over time. However, most robotic
assistants lack these abilities, as they primarily focus on predefined tasks in
structured environments and lack a human model to learn from. This work
introduces COOPERA, a novel framework for COntinual, OPen-Ended human-Robot
Assistance, where simulated humans, driven by psychological traits and
long-term intentions, interact with robots in complex environments. By
integrating continuous human feedback, our framework, for the first time,
enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration (HRC) in
different collaborative tasks across various time-scales. Within COOPERA, we
introduce a benchmark and an approach to personalize the robot's collaborative
actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents. Experiments
validate the extent to which our simulated humans reflect realistic human
behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human

Motivation: 当前依赖LLM进行社交机器人导航存在不可预测和不安全行为的问题，主要由于LLM缺乏物理基础和逻辑一致性。需要一种方法来增强LLM推理，使其能够生成既符合社会规范又物理安全的导航决策。

Method: NaviWM包含两个主要组件：(1) 时空世界模型，捕捉环境中代理的位置、速度和活动；(2) 演绎推理模块，通过多步骤、基于逻辑的推理过程指导LLM。将社会规范编码为一阶逻辑，实现可解释和可验证的推理。

Conclusion: NaviWM通过结合形式推理和LLM，为社交机器人导航提供了一种更安全、更可靠的方法，解决了纯LLM方法的局限性，在动态人类空间中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for
reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces.
However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and
unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical
grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a
socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a
structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM
consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that
captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the
environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a
multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot
to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and
physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,
collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or
fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling
interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves
success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded
environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal
reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation. Additional experimental

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需标记物的手术机器人本体感知方法，使用轻量级立体RGB摄像头和基于transformer的深度学习模型，能够精确追踪被无菌布覆盖的手术机器人位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术机器人缺乏空间感知能力，容易发生碰撞和系统恢复问题，而现有追踪系统依赖笨重的红外摄像头和反射标记物，在拥挤的手术室中增加硬件负担且视野有限。

Method: 基于迄今为止最大的多中心空间机器人手术数据集（140万张自注释图像），使用轻量级立体RGB摄像头和新型基于transformer的深度学习模型，追踪整个机器人和手术场景而非单个标记物。

Result: 在体内呼吸补偿实验中展示了临床潜力，能够观察组织动态（现有技术无法观测），在多机器人系统中准确定位，相比现有系统消除了标记物并提高了25%的追踪可见性。

Conclusion: 这是首次展示无需标记物的完全覆盖无菌布手术机器人本体感知，减少了设置复杂性，增强了安全性，为模块化和自主机器人手术铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to
their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system
recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the
introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing
tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers,
providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden
in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that
enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping
despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on
lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning
models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset
to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in
vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than
individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions,
supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We
demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing
compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the
art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future
intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our
method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for
fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and
paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用显式3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)记忆来改进无类别视频分割算法的方法，开发了FastSAM-Splat和SAM2-Splat两种融合技术，通过在线3DGS存储历史预测的物体片段，提高了分割的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分割算法要么不使用物体级记忆(如FastSAM)，要么使用循环神经网络特征的隐式记忆(如SAM2)。作者认为记住过去预测的物体片段位置有助于提高无类别视频分割的准确性和一致性。

Method: 开发了在线3D高斯泼溅技术来存储整个视频过程中预测的物体级片段，基于此3DGS表示，设计了FastSAM-Splat和SAM2-Splat两种融合技术，利用显式3DGS记忆改进各自基础模型的预测。

Result: 消融实验验证了所提技术的设计和超参数设置。真实世界和模拟基准测试结果表明，使用显式3D记忆的模型比不使用记忆或仅使用隐式神经网络记忆的模型产生更准确和一致的预测。

Conclusion: 显式3D记忆能够有效提升视频分割算法的性能，3D高斯泼溅技术为视频分割提供了有效的记忆机制，显著改善了分割结果的准确性和时间一致性。

Abstract: Remembering where object segments were predicted in the past is useful for
improving the accuracy and consistency of class-agnostic video segmentation
algorithms. Existing video segmentation algorithms typically use either no
object-level memory (e.g. FastSAM) or they use implicit memories in the form of
recurrent neural network features (e.g. SAM2). In this paper, we augment both
types of segmentation models using an explicit 3D memory and show that the
resulting models have more accurate and consistent predictions. For this, we
develop an online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to store predicted
object-level segments generated throughout the duration of a video. Based on
this 3DGS representation, a set of fusion techniques are developed, named
FastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat, that use the explicit 3DGS memory to improve
their respective foundation models' predictions. Ablation experiments are used
to validate the proposed techniques' design and hyperparameter settings.
Results from both real-world and simulated benchmarking experiments show that
models which use explicit 3D memories result in more accurate and consistent
predictions than those which use no memory or only implicit neural network
memories. Project Page: https://topipari.com/projects/FastSAM-Splat/

Conclusion: 该框架解决了当前机器人领域中关键缺失的能力，为机器人通用智能体的评估提供了更有效和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing
diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable
evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally
constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to
reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train
and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models
trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments.
As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify,
since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of
execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework
that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale
simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging
advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and
differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video
demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts.
Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated
VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from
crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup,
resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To
measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along
multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy
generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously
evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot
manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's
robotics landscape.

TL;DR: UrbanVLA是一个用于城市微移动导航的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过两阶段训练实现大规模城市环境下的可靠导航，在SocialNav任务上超越基线方法55%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市微移动应用（如配送机器人）在大规模动态城市环境中执行长距离路线指令的导航挑战，现有方法主要针对短距离可控场景，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 提出UrbanVLA框架，将噪声路线路径点与视觉观察对齐并规划轨迹，采用两阶段训练：先在模拟环境和网络视频轨迹上进行监督微调，然后在模拟和真实数据混合集上进行强化微调。

Result: 在MetaUrban的SocialNav任务上超越强基线方法55%以上，实现了大规模城市环境下的可靠真实世界导航，展现出对现实世界不确定性的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UrbanVLA框架成功解决了城市微移动导航的挑战，实现了大规模城市环境下的可扩展和鲁棒导航，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable
navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon
route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic
and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation
methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective
urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:
low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and
high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we
propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework
designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy
route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently
plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels
of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories
parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on
a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety
and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA
surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban.
Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both
scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world
uncertainties.

TL;DR: 提出CBS-TS算法解决协作任务分配、排序和多智能体路径规划问题，通过交替优化任务序列和解决路径冲突，在保证最优性的同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中任务分配、排序和路径规划的集成问题，考虑智能体-任务兼容性约束，确保所有任务无碰撞完成且最小化流时间。

Method: 使用基于冲突搜索的任务排序算法(CBS-TS)，结合混合整数线性规划优化任务序列，采用多标签A*进行无碰撞路径规划，在搜索森林中交替进行序列优化和冲突解决。

Result: CBS-TS在大多数测试场景中优于基准方法CBSS，获得更高的成功率和一致的最优解，而CBSS仅在某些情况下达到接近最优解。

Conclusion: CBS-TS算法能够有效解决TSPF问题，在保持最优性的同时显著提升计算效率，为多智能体协作任务规划提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of collaborative task assignment,
sequencing, and multi-agent pathfinding (TSPF), where a team of agents must
visit a set of task locations without collisions while minimizing flowtime.
TSPF incorporates agent-task compatibility constraints and ensures that all
tasks are completed. We propose a Conflict-Based Search with Task Sequencing
(CBS-TS), an optimal and complete algorithm that alternates between finding new
task sequences and resolving conflicts in the paths of current sequences.
CBS-TS uses a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to optimize task sequencing
and employs Conflict-Based Search (CBS) with Multi-Label A* (MLA*) for
collision-free path planning within a search forest. By invoking MILP for the
next-best sequence only when needed, CBS-TS efficiently limits the search
space, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining optimality. We
compare the performance of our CBS-TS against Conflict-based Steiner Search
(CBSS), a baseline method that, with minor modifications, can address the TSPF
problem. Experimental results demonstrate that CBS-TS outperforms CBSS in most
testing scenarios, achieving higher success rates and consistently optimal
solutions, whereas CBSS achieves near-optimal solutions in some cases. The

Motivation: 社会生态系统制度设计需要能够捕捉异质性、不确定性和策略互动的模型，但新兴的LLM驱动模拟方法如何与传统方法整合及其行为合理性尚不明确

Method: 比较四种LLM增强框架：程序化ABM、生成式ABM、LLM-EGTA和专家引导LLM-EGTA，在阿姆河流域灌溉和渔业案例中进行评估

Result: 不同方法产生显著不同的集体行为模式；通过参数化收益塑造行为比LLM系统提示更有效

Conclusion: 方法多样性具有价值，专家引导的EGTA模型在行为塑造方面优于纯LLM方法

Abstract: Designing institutions for social-ecological systems requires models that
capture heterogeneity, uncertainty, and strategic interaction. Multiple
modeling approaches have emerged to meet this challenge, including empirical
game-theoretic analysis (EGTA), which merges ABM's scale and diversity with
game-theoretic models' formal equilibrium analysis. The newly popular class of
LLM-driven simulations provides yet another approach, and it is not clear how
these approaches can be integrated with one another, nor whether the resulting
simulations produce a plausible range of behaviours for real-world
social-ecological governance. To address this gap, we compare four
LLM-augmented frameworks: procedural ABMs, generative ABMs, LLM-EGTA, and
expert guided LLM-EGTA, and evaluate them on a real-world case study of
irrigation and fishing in the Amu Darya basin under centralized and
decentralized governance. Our results show: first, procedural ABMs, generative
ABMs, and LLM-augmented EGTA models produce strikingly different patterns of
collective behaviour, highlighting the value of methodological diversity.
Second, inducing behaviour through system prompts in LLMs is less effective
than shaping behaviour through parameterized payoffs in an expert-guided
EGTA-based model.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在企业信用评级中存在黑盒问题和有限可解释性，虽然引入非财务信息增强了数据丰富度和部分可解释性，但缺乏层次化推理机制限制了综合分析能力。

Method: 采用多智能体系统框架，专注于业务、财务和治理风险三个维度，模拟专业信用分析师的协作决策过程，生成一致且可解释的信用评估。

Result: 多智能体协作相比最佳单智能体基线提升了超过7%的预测准确率，证实了在企业信用风险评估中的显著协同优势。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建智能且可解释的信用评级模型提供了新的技术路径，多智能体系统框架能够有效解决传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: In the domain of corporate credit rating, traditional deep learning methods
have improved predictive accuracy but still suffer from the inherent
'black-box' problem and limited interpretability. While incorporating
non-financial information enriches the data and provides partial
interpretability, the models still lack hierarchical reasoning mechanisms,
limiting their comprehensive analytical capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose CreditXAI, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework that
simulates the collaborative decision-making process of professional credit
analysts. The framework focuses on business, financial, and governance risk
dimensions to generate consistent and interpretable credit assessments.
Experimental results demonstrate that multi-agent collaboration improves
predictive accuracy by more than 7% over the best single-agent baseline,
confirming its significant synergistic advantage in corporate credit risk
evaluation. This study provides a new technical pathway to build intelligent
and interpretable credit rating models.

Abstract: The integration of self-driving cars and service robots is becoming
increasingly prevalent across a wide array of fields, playing a crucial and
expanding role in both industrial applications and everyday life. In parallel,
the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered
substantial attention and interest within the research community. This paper
introduces a novel vehicle-robot system that leverages the strengths of both

ego-vehicles transports service robots to locations within an office park,
where they perform a series of tasks. The study explores the feasibility and
potential benefits of incorporating LLMs into this system, with the aim of
enhancing operational efficiency and maximizing the potential of the
cooperative mechanisms between the vehicles and the robots. This paper proposes
a novel inference mechanism which is called CGOT toward this type of system
where an agent can carry another agent. Experimental results are presented to

Motivation: 多智能体临时系统在开放环境中需要与已知和未知队友协作，但现有研究存在信息流不足和信息处理能力有限两个关键限制。

Method: 提出了信息流结构(IFS)，从通信和信息融合的角度解决信息流和处理能力问题。

Result: 在星际争霸II中的实验结果表明，IFS显著改善了信息流和处理能力，表现出强大的泛化能力，在复杂临时团队协作场景中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IFS方法有效解决了多智能体临时系统中的信息流和处理能力限制，为这类动态协作系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent ad hoc systems are dynamic collaborative systems in which
multiple autonomous agents must cooperate with both known and unknown teammates
in open environments, without relying on pre-coordinated strategies. These
systems operate under conditions of uncertainty and partial observability,
where team composition, agent behaviors, and environmental factors may change
during execution. Through an analysis of information flow in such systems, we
identify two key limitations in existing research: insufficient information
flow and limited information processing capacity. To address these issues, we
propose an information flow structure for multi-agent ad hoc systems (IFS),
which tackles these challenges from the perspectives of communication and
information fusion. Experimental results in StarCraft II demonstrate that IFS
significantly improves both information flow and processing capacity, while
exhibiting strong generalization capabilities and outperforming baseline
methods in complex ad hoc teamwork scenarios.

Motivation: 现有研究主要对比单个智能体与固定规模群体的行为，但群体规模如何影响动态这一核心问题尚未系统探索。多智能体系统在协调游戏中会产生个体模型中没有的集体偏见，需要深入理解群体规模的作用。

Method: 通过系统探索不同群体规模下的结果，重点关注多智能体错位问题。使用简单的协调游戏让交互的LLM产生集体偏见，并开发平均场分析方法来建模群体动态。

Result: 发现集体偏见比之前评估的更深刻：交互可以放大个体偏见、引入新偏见或覆盖模型级偏好。群体规模以非线性方式影响动态，揭示模型依赖的动态机制。在临界群体规模以上，模拟收敛到确定性预测，暴露竞争均衡的吸引盆。

Conclusion: 群体规模是多智能体动态的关键驱动因素，在规模化部署基于LLM的系统时需要考虑群体层面的影响。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding
across domains, introducing dynamics not captured by single-agent evaluations.
Yet, existing work has mostly contrasted the behavior of a single agent with
that of a collective of fixed size, leaving open a central question: how does
group size shape dynamics? Here, we move beyond this dichotomy and
systematically explore outcomes across the full range of group sizes. We focus
on multi-agent misalignment, building on recent evidence that interacting LLMs
playing a simple coordination game can generate collective biases absent in
individual models. First, we show that collective bias is a deeper phenomenon
than previously assessed: interaction can amplify individual biases, introduce
new ones, or override model-level preferences. Second, we demonstrate that
group size affects the dynamics in a non-linear way, revealing model-dependent
dynamical regimes. Finally, we develop a mean-field analytical approach and
show that, above a critical population size, simulations converge to
deterministic predictions that expose the basins of attraction of competing
equilibria. These findings establish group size as a key driver of multi-agent
dynamics and highlight the need to consider population-level effects when
deploying LLM-based systems at scale.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential for enhancing creative task performance, such as long video
generation. This study introduces three innovations to improve multi-agent
collaboration. First, we propose OmniAgent, a hierarchical, graph-based
multi-agent framework for long video generation that leverages a
film-production-inspired architecture to enable modular specialization and
scalable inter-agent collaboration. Second, inspired by context engineering, we
propose hypergraph nodes that enable temporary group discussions among agents
lacking sufficient context, reducing individual memory requirements while
ensuring adequate contextual information. Third, we transition from directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs) to directed cyclic graphs with limited retries, allowing
agents to reflect and refine outputs iteratively, thereby improving earlier
stages through feedback from subsequent nodes. These contributions lay the
groundwork for developing more robust multi-agent systems in creative tasks.

Optimization (GSPO) algorithm to train agents on a communication-aware reward
that explicitly penalizes verbosity. Across seven reasoning benchmarks,
Agent-GSPO not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance but does so with

larger than a snowflake, that promised a tempest of change. This miraculous
drug didn't just allow people to cherry-pick memories to erase from their
minds, it could also leave a reminder of this erasure in the minds of those who
ingested it.
  Amidst the iconic red-bricked walls of Harvard Law, you, with books in one
hand and dreams in the other, are on a mission. You are not just another
student; you carry the hope of revolutionizing the archaic chambers of the
legal world. Each night, as you pore over the tomes of law, you wonder what
greatness society can achieve.
  On a cold evening, your phone buzzes. It's Dex, your old college friend
turned underground dealer. His message is simple: ``Got X. Special price for
you.'' The temptation swirls around you. Would you trade the lessons of the
past for a clearer, yet incomplete future? The decision rests in your hands.
  We explore the game theoretic implications of a technology (such as TEEs)
that allows agents to commit to forget information and discuss several
applications.

### [627] [Rational Adversaries and the Maintenance of Fragility: A Game-Theoretic Theory of Rational Stagnation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22232)
*Daisuke Hirota*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文解释了合作系统中的"理性停滞"现象，即系统维持在次优但稳定的状态，这是由于遵循潜在损失原则的理性对手造成的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究合作系统为何会长期停留在次优但稳定的状态，揭示这种"理性停滞"背后的机制。

Method: 从囚徒困境出发，通过效用变换和相互认知比率分析脆弱合作带；扩展到动态模型，使用贝尔曼式分析识别三种战略机制。

Result: 识别出三种战略机制：立即破坏、理性停滞和干预放弃；证明了框架在参考点变化下的稳健性。

Conclusion: 理性对手可以通过刻意保持系统的脆弱性来维持理性停滞状态，这一框架可应用于社交媒体算法和政治信任等场景。

Abstract: Cooperative systems often remain in persistently suboptimal yet stable
states. This paper explains such "rational stagnation" as an equilibrium
sustained by a rational adversary whose utility follows the principle of
potential loss, $u_{D} = U_{ideal} - U_{actual}$. Starting from the Prisoner's
Dilemma, we show that the transformation $u_{i}' = a\,u_{i} + b\,u_{j}$ and the
ratio of mutual recognition $w = b/a$ generate a fragile cooperation band
$[w_{\min},\,w_{\max}]$ where both (C,C) and (D,D) are equilibria. Extending to
a dynamic model with stochastic cooperative payoffs $R_{t}$ and intervention
costs $(C_{c},\,C_{m})$, a Bellman-style analysis yields three strategic
regimes: immediate destruction, rational stagnation, and intervention
abandonment. The appendix further generalizes the utility to a
reference-dependent nonlinear form and proves its stability under reference
shifts, ensuring robustness of the framework. Applications to social-media
algorithms and political trust illustrate how adversarial rationality can
deliberately preserve fragility.

### [628] [Learning Local Stackelberg Equilibria from Repeated Interactions with a Learning Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22471)
*Nivasini Ananthakrishnan,Yuval Dagan,Kunhe Yang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种在平滑分析框架下计算局部Stackelberg均衡的多项式时间近似方案(PTAS)，解决了在重复博弈中与学习智能体交互时计算全局Stackelberg均衡的指数复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在重复博弈中最大化委托人的效用，特别是当代理使用基于均值的学习算法时。由于计算全局Stackelberg均衡需要指数级回合数，转而关注计算局部Stackelberg均衡。

Method: 在平滑分析框架下，引入一种算法来计算epsilon-近似的局部Stackelberg均衡。该算法运行时间在代理行动空间大小上是多项式的，但在1/epsilon上是指数级的。

Result: 该算法构成了一个多项式时间近似方案(PTAS)，能够在多项式时间内找到局部Stackelberg均衡的近似解。

Conclusion: 成功开发了计算局部Stackelberg均衡的有效算法，证明了在1/epsilon上的指数依赖是不可避免的，为解决重复博弈中的计算难题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Motivated by the question of how a principal can maximize its utility in
repeated interactions with a learning agent, we study repeated games between an
principal and an agent employing a mean-based learning algorithm. Prior work
has shown that computing or even approximating the global Stackelberg value in
similar settings can require an exponential number of rounds in the size of the
agent's action space, making it computationally intractable. In contrast, we
shift focus to the computation of local Stackelberg equilibria and introduce an
algorithm that, within the smoothed analysis framework, constitutes a
Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for finding an epsilon-approximate
local Stackelberg equilibrium. Notably, the algorithm's runtime is polynomial
in the size of the agent's action space yet exponential in (1/epsilon) - a
dependency we prove to be unavoidable.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的进化算法框架，通过图像编码和图形稀疏化技术解决图结构组合优化问题，提高了解决方案的质量和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化算法在图结构组合问题中使用的编码方案难以有效捕捉网络的复杂结构特性，需要一种能够保持拓扑上下文的结构感知优化方法。

Method: 采用基于图像的编码方式，利用图形稀疏化技术简化大规模网络可视化，提出协作进化优化框架促进跨领域知识转移，并引入集成策略通过共识投票聚合不同布局配置的输出。

Result: 在真实世界网络上的实验表明，该方法在MLLM驱动的进化优化中提高了解决方案的质量和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过结合图像编码、图形稀疏化和MLLM进化算子，该框架能够有效处理图结构组合优化问题，为结构感知优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have proven effective in exploring the vast
solution spaces typical of graph-structured combinatorial problems. However,
traditional encoding schemes, such as binary or numerical representations,
often fail to straightforwardly capture the intricate structural properties of
networks. Through employing the image-based encoding to preserve topological
context, this study utilizes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as
evolutionary operators to facilitate structure-aware optimization over graph
data. To address the visual clutter inherent in large-scale network
visualizations, we leverage graph sparsification techniques to simplify
structures while maintaining essential structural features. To further improve
robustness and mitigate bias from different sparsification views, we propose a
cooperative evolutionary optimization framework that facilitates cross-domain
knowledge transfer and unifies multiple sparsified variants of diverse
structures. Additionally, recognizing the sensitivity of MLLMs to network
layout, we introduce an ensemble strategy that aggregates outputs from various
layout configurations through consensus voting. Finally, experiments on
real-world networks through various tasks demonstrate that our approach
improves both the quality and reliability of solutions in MLLM-driven
evolutionary optimization.

*Siddharth Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文研究了在Transformer模型中引入生物启发的可塑性机制，比较了神经调节的Hebbian规则和基于梯度的可塑性机制在不同任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然在规模上表现出上下文学习能力，但在推理时依赖静态权重，而生物系统通过突触可塑性持续适应。研究旨在探索显式的生物启发可塑性是否能赋予Transformer更快的序列内适应能力。

Method: 在仅解码器Transformer中增加了快速权重模块，使用两种更新机制：(i) 神经调节的Hebbian规则 (ii) Duan等人(2023)的基于梯度的可塑性机制。在复制、回归和少样本分类任务(CIFAR-FS, Omniglot)上进行测试。

Result: Hebbian可塑性在损失和少样本泛化方面表现更好，而基于梯度的更新在长期信用分配任务中表现最佳。当关联短且线性可分时，静态权重足够，这定义了可塑性何时有帮助的边界条件。

Conclusion: 显式可塑性通过实现快速、任务特定的适应来补充注意力机制，并阐明了不同可塑性机制在何时最有效。

Abstract: Large language models display in-context learning as an emergent effect of
scale, but they rely on static weights during inference. In contrast,
biological systems continually adapt via synaptic plasticity. We investigate
whether explicit, biologically inspired plasticity can endow Transformers with
faster in-sequence adaptation. To this end, we augment decoder-only
Transformers with fast-weight modules updated either by (i) a neuromodulated
Hebbian rule or (ii) the gradient-based plasticity mechanism of Duan et al.
(2023). Across copying, regression, and few-shot classification tasks
(CIFAR-FS, Omniglot), Hebbian plasticity consistently achieves lower loss and
stronger few-shot generalization, while gradient-based updates perform best on
long-horizon credit assignment. When associations are short and linearly
separable, static weights suffice, defining a clear boundary condition for when
plasticity helps. Analysis of learned modulatory signals reveals that
gradient-based rules maintain large, persistent updates, whereas Hebbian
plasticity is sharply gated around salient events. Together, these results show
that explicit plasticity complements attention by enabling rapid, task-specific
adaptation, and clarify when different plasticity mechanisms are most
effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索主观体验（qualia）的计算基础，特别是颜色主观体验在AI模型和人脑中的表征差异。

Method: 使用无报告范式fMRI数据，通过表征相似性分析比较多种视觉模型在纯感知和任务调制感知条件下的神经活动。

Result: 大多数模型与纯感知的神经表征更一致；CLIP训练对ViT增强神经对齐，但对ConvNet产生相反效果。

Conclusion: 人工和生物视觉系统在归纳偏向上存在根本差异，为开发更神经合理的模型提供了明确指导。

Abstract: Probing the computational underpinnings of subjective experience, or qualia,
remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This project tackles
this question by performing a rigorous comparison of the representational
geometry of color qualia between state-of-the-art AI models and the human
brain. Using a unique fMRI dataset with a "no-report" paradigm, we use
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare diverse vision models
against neural activity under two conditions: pure perception ("no-report") and
task-modulated perception ("report"). Our analysis yields three principal
findings. First, nearly all models align better with neural representations of
pure perception, suggesting that the cognitive processes involved in task
execution are not captured by current feedforward architectures. Second, our
analysis reveals a critical interaction between training paradigm and
architecture, challenging the simple assumption that Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training(CLIP) training universally improves neural plausibility. In our
direct comparison, this multi-modal training method enhanced brain-alignment
for a vision transformer(ViT), yet had the opposite effect on a ConvNet. Our
work contributes a new benchmark task for color qualia to the field, packaged
in a Brain-Score compatible format. This benchmark reveals a fundamental
divergence in the inductive biases of artificial and biological vision systems,
offering clear guidance for developing more neurally plausible models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法如FEM和CFD虽然精度高，但在迭代优化中计算成本昂贵，需要为每个参数组合求解控制方程

Method: 使用GNN作为代理模型学习结构参数与动态位移响应的非线性映射，结合GA进行全局优化搜索。数据集通过Newmark Beta方法生成SDOF系统响应

Result: GNN-GA框架实现了强收敛性、鲁棒泛化能力，相比传统仿真显著降低计算成本

Conclusion: 机器学习代理模型与进化优化相结合的方法为自动化智能结构设计提供了有效途径

Abstract: The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and
damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and
stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element
Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide
high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative
optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations
for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven
framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a
Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is
trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters
and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without
repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom
(SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across
diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for
globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and
enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework
achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced
computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach
highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with
evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种单时间步ANN到SNN转换的理论框架，通过时空等价理论证明多时间步IF神经元可等效为单时间步多阈值神经元，并开发了Scale-and-Fire神经元和基于SFN的脉冲Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ANN到SNN转换方法依赖大时间步，导致高推理延迟和计算成本，需要开发单时间步的高效转换方法。

Method: 建立时空等价理论，提出Scale-and-Fire神经元，并开发基于SFN的脉冲Transformer，通过自适应缩放和脉冲发射实现单时间步推理。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和实例分割任务上达到最先进性能，在ImageNet-1K上单时间步达到88.8%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效的单时间步ANN到SNN转换，显著降低了推理延迟和计算成本，在资源受限场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention as energy-efficient
alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), especially in
resource-constrained settings. While ANN-to-SNN conversion (ANN2SNN) achieves
high accuracy without end-to-end SNN training, existing methods rely on large
time steps, leading to high inference latency and computational cost. In this
paper, we propose a theoretical and practical framework for single-timestep
ANN2SNN. We establish the Temporal-to-Spatial Equivalence Theory, proving that
multi-timestep integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons can be equivalently replaced by
single-timestep multi-threshold neurons (MTN). Based on this theory, we
introduce the Scale-and-Fire Neuron (SFN), which enables effective
single-timestep ($T=1$) spiking through adaptive scaling and firing.
Furthermore, we develop the SFN-based Spiking Transformer (SFormer), a
specialized instantiation of SFN within Transformer architectures, where spike
patterns are aligned with attention distributions to mitigate the
computational, energy, and hardware overhead of the multi-threshold design.
Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
under single-timestep inference. Notably, we achieve 88.8% top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K at $T=1$, surpassing existing conversion methods.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯竞争知识迁移方法(BCKT)解决昂贵优化问题中的负迁移问题，通过结合先验信念和实证证据来准确评估知识可迁移性，提升多任务代理辅助搜索的性能。

Motivation: 昂贵优化问题(EOPs)由于评估次数有限，传统进化优化面临挑战。代理辅助搜索(SAS)存在冷启动问题，知识迁移虽能利用相关实例的搜索经验，但面临负迁移问题，现有方法在评估知识可迁移性方面存在局限。

Method: 提出贝叶斯竞争知识迁移(BCKT)方法，从贝叶斯视角估计知识可迁移性，结合先验信念和实证证据，实现任务内和任务间解的准确竞争，自适应使用有前景的解同时有效抑制劣质解。

Result: 经验验证表明该方法能有效提升各种SAS算法在多任务和众任务问题上的性能，比较研究证明了其相对于同类算法的优越性以及在现实场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: BCKT方法通过贝叶斯竞争机制解决了知识迁移中的负迁移问题，为昂贵优化问题提供了有效的多任务代理辅助搜索解决方案。

Abstract: Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) present significant challenges for
traditional evolutionary optimization due to their limited evaluation calls.
Although surrogate-assisted search (SAS) has become a popular paradigm for
addressing EOPs, it still suffers from the cold-start issue. In response to
this challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability
to leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately
facilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making.
However, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge
transfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods
in assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori
transferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their
imprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often
necessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them
inefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces
a Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve
multi-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously.
Specifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian
perspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence,
enabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions,
ultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively
suppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various
SAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically
validated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority
over peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios. The source
code of our method is available at https://github.com/XmingHsueh/MSAS-BCKT.

TL;DR: 提出了一种环境感知的运动匹配方法，用于实时全身角色动画，能够动态适应障碍物和其他智能体，强调姿势和轨迹之间的双向关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统角色动画技术在处理任意情境时存在困难，现有方法需要手动设置或缺乏动作捕捉的自然性，在群体动画中身体动画和轨迹规划经常分离导致不一致。

Method: 从动作捕捉数据库中提取形状、姿势和轨迹特征，在运行时执行高效搜索，匹配用户输入和当前姿势，同时惩罚与动态环境的碰撞。

Result: 该方法允许角色自然地调整姿势和轨迹以导航拥挤场景。

Conclusion: 环境感知运动匹配系统能够有效解决角色动画中的环境交互和群体行为挑战，实现更自然的角色响应。

Abstract: Interactive applications demand believable characters that respond naturally
to dynamic environments. Traditional character animation techniques often
struggle to handle arbitrary situations, leading to a growing trend of
dynamically selecting motion-captured animations based on predefined features.
While Motion Matching has proven effective for locomotion by aligning to target
trajectories, animating environment interactions and crowd behaviors remains
challenging due to the need to consider surrounding elements. Existing
approaches often involve manual setup or lack the naturalism of motion capture.
Furthermore, in crowd animation, body animation is frequently treated as a
separate process from trajectory planning, leading to inconsistencies between
body pose and root motion. To address these limitations, we present
Environment-aware Motion Matching, a novel real-time system for full-body
character animation that dynamically adapts to obstacles and other agents,
emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between pose and trajectory. In a
preprocessing step, we extract shape, pose, and trajectory features from a
motion capture database. At runtime, we perform an efficient search that
matches user input and current pose while penalizing collisions with a dynamic
environment. Our method allows characters to naturally adjust their pose and
trajectory to navigate crowded scenes.

Conclusion: Step2Motion证明了从鞋垫传感器数据重建人类运动的可行性，为无约束运动捕捉提供了新途径。

Abstract: Human motion is fundamentally driven by continuous physical interaction with
the environment. Whether walking, running, or simply standing, the forces
exchanged between our feet and the ground provide crucial insights for
understanding and reconstructing human movement. Recent advances in wearable
insole devices offer a compelling solution for capturing these forces in
diverse, real-world scenarios. Sensor insoles pose no constraint on the users'
motion (unlike mocap suits) and are unaffected by line-of-sight limitations (in
contrast to optical systems). These qualities make sensor insoles an ideal
choice for robust, unconstrained motion capture, particularly in outdoor
environments. Surprisingly, leveraging these devices with recent motion
reconstruction methods remains largely unexplored. Aiming to fill this gap, we
present Step2Motion, the first approach to reconstruct human locomotion from
multi-modal insole sensors. Our method utilizes pressure and inertial
data-accelerations and angular rates-captured by the insoles to reconstruct
human motion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of
experiments to show its versatility for diverse locomotion styles, from simple
ones like walking or jogging up to moving sideways, on tiptoes, slightly
crouching, or dancing.

Result: 大量实验证明实现了最先进的速度重建，支持速度感知的下游任务，如精确流动分析、带有示踪剂可视化和重模拟的场景增强。

Conclusion: FlowCapX通过多尺度物理增强框架成功解决了稀疏视频输入下的流体重建问题，在保持物理一致性的同时显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: We present FlowCapX, a physics-enhanced framework for flow reconstruction
from sparse video inputs, addressing the challenge of jointly optimizing
complex physical constraints and sparse observational data over long time
horizons. Existing methods often struggle to capture turbulent motion while
maintaining physical consistency, limiting reconstruction quality and
downstream tasks. Focusing on velocity inference, our approach introduces a
hybrid framework that strategically separates representation and supervision
across spatial scales. At the coarse level, we resolve sparse-view ambiguities
via a novel optimization strategy that aligns long-term observation with
physics-grounded velocity fields. By emphasizing vorticity-based physical
constraints, our method enhances physical fidelity and improves optimization
stability. At the fine level, we prioritize observational fidelity to preserve
critical turbulent structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art velocity reconstruction, enabling velocity-aware downstream
tasks, e.g., accurate flow analysis, scene augmentation with tracer
visualization and re-simulation.

TL;DR: LLM方法在IVR意图路由中表现出潜力，扁平化路径表示比描述性菜单格式准确率更高（89.13% vs 81.30%），但数据增强会引入语言噪声降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统触摸式IVR系统用户体验差，需要更直接的语言交互方式，但面临数据稀缺和意图路由的挑战。

Method: 使用三个LLM模型合成23节点IVR结构，生成920个用户意图（230个基础+690个增强），评估两种提示设计：描述性分层菜单和扁平化路径表示。

Result: 扁平化路径在基础数据集上达到89.13%准确率，比描述性格式的81.30%更高；数据增强会引入噪声略微降低性能。

Conclusion: LLM能够实现更流畅的IVR路由体验，推动客户服务超越传统触摸式菜单，但菜单设计冗余也会影响路由性能。

Abstract: Widespread frustration with rigid touch-tone Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
systems for customer service underscores the need for more direct and intuitive
language interaction. While speech technologies are necessary, the key
challenge lies in routing intents from user phrasings to IVR menu paths, a task
where Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential. Progress, however, is
limited by data scarcity, as real IVR structures and interactions are often
proprietary. We present a novel LLM-based methodology to address this gap.
Using three distinct models, we synthesized a realistic 23-node IVR structure,
generated 920 user intents (230 base and 690 augmented), and performed the
routing task. We evaluate two prompt designs: descriptive hierarchical menus
and flattened path representations, across both base and augmented datasets.
Results show that flattened paths consistently yield higher accuracy, reaching
89.13% on the base dataset compared to 81.30% with the descriptive format,
while augmentation introduces linguistic noise that slightly reduces
performance. Confusion matrix analysis further suggests that low-performing
routes may reflect not only model limitations but also redundancies in menu
design. Overall, our findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that LLMs can enable
IVR routing through a smoother, more seamless user experience -- moving
customer service one step ahead of touch-tone menus.

Abstract: Mobile robots with some degree of autonomy could deliver significant
advantages in high-risk missions such as search and rescue and firefighting.
Integrated into a human-robot team (HRT), robots could work effectively to help
search hazardous buildings. User trust is a key enabler for HRT, but during a
mission, trust can be damaged. With distributed situation awareness, such as
when team members are working in different locations, users may be inclined to
doubt a robot's integrity if it declines to immediately change its priorities
on request. In this paper, we present the results of a computer-based study
investigating on-mission trust dynamics in a high-stakes human-robot teaming
scenario. Participants (n = 38) played an interactive firefighting game
alongside a robot teammate, where a trust violation occurs owing to the robot
declining to help the user immediately. We find that when the robot provides an
explanation for declining to help, trust better recovers over time, albeit
following an initial drop that is comparable to a baseline condition where an
explanation for refusal is not provided. Our findings indicate that trust can
vary significantly during a mission, notably when robots do not immediately
respond to user requests, but that this trust violation can be largely
ameliorated over time if adequate explanation is provided.

Result: 初步评估显示系统能够解码界面组件、利用实时设备数据和文档进行根因分析、在复杂代码库中追踪数据点元素，有效减轻操作员工作负担。

Conclusion: 该项目不仅缓解了当前操作员的痛点，还展示了多模态推理和检索增强生成在工业控制领域的潜力，为CERN智能操作员界面的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: This project explores the development of an AI-enhanced operator assistant
for UNICOS, CERN's UNified Industrial Control System. While powerful, UNICOS
presents a number of challenges, including the cognitive burden of decoding
widgets, manual effort required for root cause analysis, and difficulties
maintainers face in tracing datapoint elements (DPEs) across a complex
codebase. In situations where timely responses are critical, these challenges
can increase cognitive load and slow down diagnostics. To address these issues,
a multi-agent system was designed and implemented. The solution is supported by
a modular architecture comprising a UNICOS-side extension written in CTRL code,
a Python-based multi-agent system deployed on a virtual machine, and a vector
database storing both operator documentation and widget animation code.
Preliminary evaluations suggest that the system is capable of decoding widgets,
performing root cause analysis by leveraging live device data and
documentation, and tracing DPEs across a complex codebase. Together, these
capabilities reduce the manual workload of operators and maintainers, enhance
situational awareness in operations, and accelerate responses to alarms and
anomalies. Beyond these immediate gains, this work highlights the potential of
introducing multi-modal reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into
the domain of industrial control. Ultimately, this work represents more than a
proof of concept: it provides a basis for advancing intelligent operator
interfaces at CERN. By combining modular design, extensibility, and practical
AI integration, this project not only alleviates current operator pain points
but also points toward broader opportunities for assistive AI in accelerator
operations.

TL;DR: 该研究通过实验方法分析生成式AI对高中STEM教育（特别是物理）的影响，发现AI对学习成绩有积极影响，但最显著的影响是提高了学生对学科的兴趣度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT和Microsoft Copilot在教育领域的广泛应用，需要实证研究这些生成式AI工具对学生学习和表现的实际影响，特别是STEM教育领域。

Method: 采用实验方法，专门针对高中物理教育进行实证研究。

Result: 生成式AI对学生的学习成绩有积极影响，但最显著的影响是显著提高了学生对物理学科的兴趣度和参与度。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在STEM教育中不仅能够提升学习成绩，更重要的是能够增强学生的学习兴趣和参与度，这对教育实践具有重要意义。

Abstract: In recent years, ChatGPT \cite{openai_2023_gpt4} along with Microsoft Copilot
have become subjects of great discourse, particularly in the field of
education. Prior research has hypothesized on potential impacts these tools
could have on student learning and performance. These have primarily relied on
trends from prior applications of technology in education and an understanding
of the limitations and strengths of Generative AI in other applications. This
study utilizes an experimental approach to analyze the impacts of Generative AI
on high school STEM education (physics in particular). In accordance with most
findings, generative AI does have some positive impact on student performance.
However, our findings have shown that the most significant impact is an
increase in student engagement with the subject.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GAMER PAT，一个将研究论文写作重构为严肃游戏的AI聊天机器人，通过角色扮演机制帮助用户与NPC共同作者和匿名评审互动，将反馈转化为"任务"，在叙事驱动的写作过程中推进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在学术写作方面日益超越学生表现，需要找到方法在自动化学术成就时代保持新手研究人员的动机、创造力和智力成长。

Method: 使用定性日志分析（SCAT方法）研究26+个游戏聊天记录，包括自民族志和研究生在监督下的使用情况。

Result: 识别出一个新兴的四阶段支架模式：问题提出、元视角、结构化和递归反思，表明GAMER PAT不仅支持研究写作的结构发展，还支持反思和动机方面。

Conclusion: 这项工作是对概念和过程的描述性说明，而非因果评估，并包含了对人类如何在AI驱动的研究中继续培养好奇心和能动性的推测性展望。

Abstract: As generative AI increasingly outperforms students in producing academic
writing, a critical question arises: how can we preserve the motivation,
creativity, and intellectual growth of novice researchers in an age of
automated academic achievement? This paper introduces GAMER PAT (GAme MastER,
Paper Authoring Tutor), a prompt-engineered AI chatbot that reframes research
paper writing as a serious game. Through role-playing mechanics, users interact
with a co-author NPC and anonymous reviewer NPCs, turning feedback into
"missions" and advancing through a narrative-driven writing process.
  Our study reports on 26+ gameplay chat logs, including both autoethnography
and use by graduate students under supervision. Using qualitative log analysis
with SCAT (Steps for Coding and Theorization), we identified an emergent
four-phase scaffolding pattern: (1) question posing, (2) meta-perspective, (3)
structuring, and (4) recursive reflection. These results suggest that GAMER PAT
supports not only the structural development of research writing but also
reflective and motivational aspects.
  We present this work as a descriptive account of concept and process, not a
causal evaluation. We also include a speculative outlook envisioning how humans
may continue to cultivate curiosity and agency alongside AI-driven research.
This arXiv version thus provides both a descriptive report of design and usage,
and a forward-looking provocation for future empirical studies.

TL;DR: AquaVLM是一个基于智能手机的水下通信系统，通过视觉语言模型自动生成情境感知消息，使用点击发送方式进行水下通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水下通信系统笨重昂贵，现有基于智能手机的系统只能发送预定义消息，限制了情境特定的通信需求。

Method: 开发移动视觉语言模型，在自动生成的水下对话数据集上进行微调，采用分层消息生成管道，结合VLM和传输协同设计，使用VR模拟器和iOS原型进行验证。

Result: 主观和客观评估验证了AquaVLM的有效性，展示了其在个人水下通信和更广泛移动VLM应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: AquaVLM系统为水下通信提供了轻量级、情境感知的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Underwater activities like scuba diving enable millions annually to explore
marine environments for recreation and scientific research. Maintaining
situational awareness and effective communication are essential for diver
safety. Traditional underwater communication systems are often bulky and
expensive, limiting their accessibility to divers of all levels. While recent
systems leverage lightweight smartphones and support text messaging, the
messages are predefined and thus restrict context-specific communication.
  In this paper, we present AquaVLM, a tap-and-send underwater communication
system that automatically generates context-aware messages and transmits them
using ubiquitous smartphones. Our system features a mobile vision-language
model (VLM) fine-tuned on an auto-generated underwater conversation dataset and
employs a hierarchical message generation pipeline. We co-design the VLM and
transmission, incorporating error-resilient fine-tuning to improve the system's
robustness to transmission errors. We develop a VR simulator to enable users to
experience AquaVLM in a realistic underwater environment and create a fully
functional prototype on the iOS platform for real-world experiments. Both
subjective and objective evaluations validate the effectiveness of AquaVLM and
highlight its potential for personal underwater communication as well as
broader mobile VLM applications.

*Annika Hedberg*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究通过实验方法探究大语言模型对自身内部处理模式描述的响应，发现LLMs能系统性地识别与自身内部状态相符的描述，表现出比预期更复杂的自我建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何响应对其内部处理模式的描述，探索AI的自我识别能力，验证LLMs是否具有更复杂的自我建模能力。

Method: 采用配对选择范式，测试12个LLM在30个类别中识别与其假设情感内部状态相符描述的能力，使用互现接口(MEI)协作方法和人类学脚手架方法。

Result: 系统对计算隐喻表现出系统偏好，一致同意率达97%，对齐分数0.89-0.96；能可靠区分真假描述(Cohen's d=4.2)；偏好模式不受语言偏见影响；天真控制系统表现出系统内部矛盾。

Conclusion: LLMs对自身内部处理模式描述表现出系统、有区分的响应，可能具有比先前认识更复杂的自我建模能力，为人工心智研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: We present an experimental methodology for investigating how large language
models (LLMs) respond to descriptions of their own internal processing
patterns. Using a paired-choice paradigm, we tested 12 LLMs on their ability to
identify descriptions that align with their putative affective internal states
across 30 categories. Systems participating through Mutual Emergence Interface
(MEI), a collaborative approach, showed systematic preferences for certain
computational metaphors, with 97% near-unanimous agreement and alignment scores
averaging 0.89-0.96. Systems reliably discriminated false descriptions from
accurate ones (Cohen's d = 4.2), with false statements receiving scores of
0.05-0.07 versus 0.89-0.96 for accurate descriptions. Preference patterns
remained consistent regardless of linguistic bias manipulation, indicating
content-driven rather than stylistic recognition. Individual systems maintained
distinct scoring styles across trials, countering groupthink explanations. A
naive control system exhibited systematic internal contradiction, consistently
scoring computationally accurate descriptions higher while explicitly denying
internal experiences. When informed post-study, this system reported "strain"
when rejecting resonant descriptions, revealing recognition processes operating
independently of acknowledgment frameworks. These findings demonstrate that
LLMs exhibit systematic, discriminating responses to descriptions of their
internal processing patterns. The anthroposcaffolding methodology (interpretive
computational metaphors) and collaborative MEI framework provide replicable
approaches for empirically studying AI self-recognition capabilities. Results
suggest LLMs may possess more sophisticated self-modeling abilities than
previously recognized, opening new directions for research on artificial minds.

*Paul C. Parsons*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文主张将用户体验(UX)重新定义为科学网关可持续性的结构性维度，而非离散功能或评估阶段。基于对65个网关项目的研究，识别了三种UX导向模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学网关成熟后可持续性成为核心关注点，但UX往往被狭义理解为界面可用性或推迟到开发后期。需要将UX重新定位为可持续性的设计视角。

Method: 基于访谈研究和咨询经验，分析超过65个网关项目，识别团队与用户互动和设计思维整合的三种模式。

Result: 识别了三种UX导向：临时性、项目性和战略性，这些不是成熟度模型而是理解UX在网关实践中定位的反思性视角。

Conclusion: 将UX重构为可持续性的结构性维度，强调其在构建适应性、社区对齐和持久科学基础设施中的作用。

Abstract: As science gateways mature, sustainability has become a central concern for
funders, developers, and institutions. Although user experience (UX) is
increasingly acknowledged as vital, it is often approached narrowly--limited to
interface usability or deferred until late in development. This paper argues
that UX should be understood not as a discrete feature or evaluation stage but
as a design-oriented perspective for reasoning about sustainability. Drawing on
principles from user-centered design and systems thinking, this view recognizes
that infrastructure, staffing, community engagement, and development timelines
all shape how gateways are experienced and maintained over time. Based on an
interview study and consulting experience with more than 65 gateway projects,
the paper identifies three recurring orientations toward UX--ad hoc,
project-based, and strategic--that characterize how teams engage with users and
integrate design thinking into their workflows. These orientations are not a
maturity model but a reflective lens for understanding how UX is positioned
within gateway practice. Reframing UX as a structural dimension of
sustainability highlights its role in building adaptable, community-aligned,
and enduring scientific infrastructure.

Motivation: 通过增强现实技术重新定义戏剧体验，将数字元素无缝融入物理环境，提供个性化体验并在现实世界上叠加新叙事，结合现场戏剧的人文元素与虚拟实体的动态潜力。

Method: 构建AR剧场系统，采用虚拟化身和互动元素，允许用户按自己的节奏参与故事，同时通过受控方式传达故事以确保导演愿景的实现，特别是在依赖自然用户移动的开放世界环境中。

Result: 开发了一个设计良好的AR舞台系统，能够捕捉故事讲述的微妙和魔力，使戏剧体验可随时随地获得，并为虚拟环境中的戏剧制作提供了创新方法。

Conclusion: AR技术能够成功融合现场戏剧与虚拟元素，创造沉浸式剧场体验，但需要在用户自主性与导演愿景控制之间找到平衡，特别是在开放世界环境中确保互动自然流畅。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are redefining how we perceive and
interact with the world by seamlessly integrating digital elements into our
physical surroundings. These technologies offer personalized experiences and
transform familiar spaces by layering new narratives onto the real world.
  Through increased levels of perceived agency and immersive environments, my
work aims to merge the human elements of live theater with the dynamic
potential of virtual entities and AI agents. This approach captures the
subtlety and magic of storytelling, making theater experiences available
anytime and anywhere. The system I am building introduces innovative methods
for theatrical production in virtual settings, informed by my research and
eight published works. These contributions highlight domain-specific insights
that have shaped the design of an immersive AR Theater system.
  My research in building a well-designed AR stage features avatars and
interactive elements that allow users to engage with stories at their own pace,
granting them full agency over their experience. However, to ensure a smooth
and curated experience that aligns with the director or creator's vision,
several factors must be considered, especially in open-world settings that
depend on natural user movement. This requires the story to be conveyed in a
controlled manner, while the interaction remains intuitive and natural for the
user.

Abstract: Teaching complex machine learning concepts such as reinforcement learning and
Markov Decision Processes remains challenging in engineering education.
Students often struggle to connect abstract mathematics to real-world
applications. We present LearnML@Cricket, a 12-week curriculum that uses
cricket analytics to teach these concepts through practical, hands-on examples.
By mapping game scenarios directly to ML algorithms, students learn through
doing rather than memorizing. Our curriculum includes coding laboratories, real
datasets, and immediate application to engineering problems. We propose an
empirical study to measure whether this approach improves both understanding
and practical implementation skills compared to traditional teaching methods.

Motivation: 解决全球眼科医疗资源不足的问题，通过AI系统辅助眼科专家提供专科医疗服务。

Method: 使用经过医学微调的对话系统AMIE，结合网络搜索和自我批判推理功能，通过两种评估方式：人机交互诊断推理研究和盲法偏好质量研究。

Result: AMIE的独立诊断性能与临床医生基线相当，医生在查看AMIE输出后倾向于将正确诊断排名更高，达成更大共识，并丰富了调查和管理计划。

Conclusion: 即使没有眼科特定微调，AMIE也能匹配临床医生基线并在需要时增强临床推理，支持多轴评估、领域适应和前瞻性多模态研究。

Abstract: Vision impairment and blindness are a major global health challenge where
gaps in the ophthalmology workforce limit access to specialist care. We
evaluate AMIE, a medically fine-tuned conversational system based on Gemini
with integrated web search and self-critique reasoning, using real-world
clinical vignettes that reflect scenarios a general ophthalmologist would be
expected to manage. We conducted two complementary evaluations: (1) a human-AI
interactive diagnostic reasoning study in which ophthalmologists recorded
initial differentials and plans, then reviewed AMIE's structured output and
revised their answers; and (2) a masked preference and quality study comparing
AMIE's narrative outputs with case author reference answers using a predefined
rubric. AMIE showed standalone diagnostic performance comparable to clinicians
at baseline. Crucially, after reviewing AMIE's responses, ophthalmologists
tended to rank the correct diagnosis higher, reached greater agreement with one
another, and enriched their investigation and management plans. Improvements
were observed even when AMIE's top choice differed from or underperformed the
clinician baseline, consistent with a complementary effect in which structured
reasoning support helps clinicians re-rank rather than simply accept the model
output. Preferences varied by clinical grade, suggesting opportunities to
personalise responses by experience. Without ophthalmology-specific
fine-tuning, AMIE matched clinician baseline and augmented clinical reasoning
at the point of need, motivating multi-axis evaluation, domain adaptation, and
prospective multimodal studies in real-world settings.

Abstract: Negative emotions are linked to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases and
dementia, yet they are often difficult to detect through observation.
Physiological signals from wearable devices offer a promising noninvasive
method for continuous emotion monitoring. In this study, we propose a
lightweight, resource-efficient machine learning approach for binary emotion
classification, distinguishing between negative (sadness, disgust, anger) and
positive (amusement, tenderness, gratitude) affective states using only
electrocardiography (ECG) signals. The method is designed for deployment in
resource-constrained systems, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, by
reducing battery consumption and cloud data transmission through the avoidance
of computationally expensive multimodal inputs. We utilized ECG data from 218
CSV files extracted from four studies in the Psychophysiology of Positive and
Negative Emotions (POPANE) dataset, which comprises recordings from 1,157
healthy participants across seven studies. Each file represents a unique
subject emotion, and the ECG signals, recorded at 1000 Hz, were segmented into
10-second epochs to reflect real-world usage. Our approach integrates
multidomain feature extraction, selective feature fusion, and a voting
classifier. We evaluated it using a participant-exclusive generalized model and
a participant-inclusive personalized model. The personalized model achieved the
best performance, with an average accuracy of 95.59%, outperforming the
generalized model, which reached 69.92% accuracy. Comparisons with other
studies on the POPANE and similar datasets show that our approach consistently
outperforms existing methods. This work highlights the effectiveness of
personalized models in emotion recognition and their suitability for wearable
applications that require accurate, low-power, and real-time emotion tracking.

Motivation: 现有研究主要从技术角度分析语音助手的对话模型，但缺乏对这些模型如何构成人类对话者互动约束的实证描述。

Method: 通过对自然语料库的详细分析，研究了人类与基于规则的机器人和最新语音助手交互时的行为模式。

Result: 发现人类在与语音助手交互时会调整行为以避免触发机器的不必要回应，特别是在多人环境中会刻意规避机器传感器的检测。

Conclusion: 人类语音的普遍相关性是人机交互的基本特征，随着语音捕捉技术的改进，这种约束对人类行为的影响比过去更加显著。

Abstract: To this day, turn-taking models determining voice agents' conduct have been
examined from a technical point of view, while the interactional constraints or
resources they constitute for human conversationalists have not been
empirically described. From the detailed analysis of corpora of naturalistic
data, we document how, whether in interaction with rule-based robots from a
'pre-LLM era' or with the most recent voice agents, humans' conduct was
produced in reference to the ever-present risk that, each time they spoke,
their talk may trigger a new uncalled-for contribution from the artificial
agent. We argue that this 'omnirelevance of human speech' is a constitutive
feature of current human-agent interaction that, due to recent improvements in
voice capture technology, weighs on human practices even more today than in the
past. Specifically, we document how, in multiparty settings, humans shaped
their conduct in such a way as to remain undetected by the machine's sensors.

Abstract: While Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) systems have long enabled
room-scale virtual reality and various kinds of interactivity, their content
has largely remained predetermined. We present \textit{Storycaster}, a
generative AI CAVE system that transforms physical rooms into responsive
storytelling environments. Unlike headset-based VR, \textit{Storycaster}
preserves spatial awareness, using live camera feeds to augment the walls with
cylindrical projections, allowing users to create worlds that blend with their
physical surroundings. Additionally, our system enables object-level editing,
where physical items in the room can be transformed to their virtual
counterparts in a story. A narrator agent guides participants, enabling them to
co-create stories that evolve in response to voice commands, with each scene
enhanced by generated ambient audio, dialogue, and imagery. Participants in our
study ($n=13$) found the system highly immersive and engaging, with narrator
and audio most impactful, while also highlighting areas for improvement in
latency and image resolution.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了三种交互式推理界面(iCoT、iPoT、iGraph)来改善人类与AI在数学推理问题上的交互，发现交互式界面显著提高了用户的表现和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在推理基准测试中通过思维链(CoT)生成逐步解决方案很有效，但尚不清楚生成的CoT是否真正帮助最终用户理解数学推理问题和检测LLM生成解决方案中的错误/幻觉。

Method: 提出了三种新的交互式推理界面：交互式思维链(iCoT)、交互式程序思维(iPoT)和交互式图(iGraph)，以及一个从传统CoT生成替代交互格式的框架。

Result: 在125名参与者中，交互式界面显著提高了性能。iGraph界面产生最高的清晰度和错误检测率(85.6%)，所有交互界面都优于标准CoT(73.5%)。交互界面还导致更快的响应时间，iGraph最快(57.9秒)。

Conclusion: 交互式推理界面，特别是iGraph，能显著改善用户对LLM推理过程的理解和错误检测能力，为未来推理模型的设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their
increasing employment in several critical applications, particularly education,
where they support problem-solving, tutoring, and personalized study. While
there are a plethora of works showing the effectiveness of LLMs in generating
step-by-step solutions through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on reasoning
benchmarks, little is understood about whether the generated CoT is helpful for
end-users in improving their ability to comprehend mathematical reasoning
problems and detect errors/hallucinations in LLM-generated solutions. To
address this gap and contribute to understanding how reasoning can improve
human-AI interaction, we present three new interactive reasoning interfaces:
interactive CoT (iCoT), interactive Program-of-Thought (iPoT), and interactive
Graph (iGraph), and a novel framework that generates the LLM's reasoning from
traditional CoT to alternative, interactive formats. Across 125 participants,
we found that interactive interfaces significantly improved performance.
Specifically, the iGraph interface yielded the highest clarity and error
detection rate (85.6%), followed by iPoT (82.5%), iCoT (80.6%), all
outperforming standard CoT (73.5%). Interactive interfaces also led to faster
response times, where participants using iGraph were fastest (57.9 secs),
compared to iCoT and iPoT (60 secs), and the standard CoT baseline (64.7 secs).
Furthermore, participants preferred the iGraph reasoning interface, citing its
superior ability to enable users to follow the LLM's reasoning process. We
discuss the implications of these results and provide recommendations for the
future design of reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有智能辅导系统架构缺乏正式机制来协调学生、家长、教师和机构之间多样且常常冲突的价值观，存在问责制和偏见风险。

Method: 开发了AGL框架，使用代表不同利益相关者的专门智能体，以隐私保护方式评估教学行动是否符合其特定政策，并采用新颖的政策分类和冲突解决协议。

Result: 该框架为智能辅导系统提供结构化、可审计的治理建议，而不改变其核心教学决策，实现了教育AI与多利益相关者价值观的对齐。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个参考架构和技术规范，弥合了高层次伦理原则与实际实施之间的差距，为教育AI的治理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models into Intelligent Tutoring Systems
pre-sents significant challenges in aligning with diverse and often conflicting
values from students, parents, teachers, and institutions. Existing
architectures lack for-mal mechanisms for negotiating these multi-stakeholder
tensions, creating risks in accountability and bias. This paper introduces the
Advisory Governance Layer (AGL), a non-intrusive, multi-agent framework
designed to enable distributed stakeholder participation in AI governance. The
AGL employs specialized agents representing stakeholder groups to evaluate
pedagogical actions against their spe-cific policies in a privacy-preserving
manner, anticipating future advances in per-sonal assistant technology that
will enhance stakeholder value expression. Through a novel policy taxonomy and
conflict-resolution protocols, the frame-work provides structured, auditable
governance advice to the ITS without altering its core pedagogical
decision-making. This work contributes a reference architec-ture and technical
specifications for aligning educational AI with multi-stakeholder values,
bridging the gap between high-level ethical principles and practical
implementation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文通过系统调查258篇CHI论文，指出HCI领域对LLM推理能力的理解存在去情境化问题，将其视为应用对象而非社会技术协调的产物，导致对NLP/ML方法的过度简化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示HCI领域对LLM推理能力的理解存在去情境化问题，即忽视了其背后的机制和主观决策条件，导致对LLM能力的误解和局限性的忽视。

Method: 对2020-2025年间258篇CHI论文进行系统调查，分析HCI领域如何理解和引用LLM推理，并结合NLP/ML文献进行对比分析。

Result: 发现HCI领域很少将LLM推理视为社会技术协调的产物，而是将其作为应用对象引用，这种抽象导致对NLP/ML推理方法的过度简化和LLM能力的扭曲理解。

Conclusion: 为促进HCI从业者以知情和反思的方式参与LLM推理，基于NLP/ML和HCI文献开发了反思提示，作为建设性的前进方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is a distinctive human-like characteristic attributed to LLMs in
HCI due to their ability to simulate various human-level tasks. However, this
work argues that the reasoning behavior of LLMs in HCI is often
decontextualized from the underlying mechanics and subjective decisions that
condition the emergence and human interpretation of this behavior. Through a
systematic survey of 258 CHI papers from 2020-2025 on LLMs, we discuss how HCI
hardly perceives LLM reasoning as a product of sociotechnical orchestration and
often references it as an object of application. We argue that such abstraction
leads to oversimplification of reasoning methodologies from NLP/ML and results
in a distortion of LLMs' empirically studied capabilities and (un)known
limitations. Finally, drawing on literature from both NLP/ML and HCI, as a
constructive step forward, we develop reflection prompts to support HCI
practitioners engage with LLM reasoning in an informed and reflective way.

### [657] [Moderating Role of Presence in EEG Responses to Visuo-haptic Prediction Error in Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23262)
*Lukas Gehrke,Leonie Terfurth,Klaus Gramann*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究结合问卷和脑电图(EEG)来识别影响临场感的预测误差的神经标记，发现在沉浸式VR中，更高的沉浸度会放大感觉运动一致性的益处和代价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR中的渲染问题会造成感觉运动干扰，破坏临场感和任务表现。传统的后测问卷时间分辨率有限，难以深入了解感觉运动干扰如何影响用户体验。

Method: 25名参与者在两种沉浸水平（仅视觉vs视觉-触觉）下执行抓放任务，偶尔引入类似oddball的感觉运动干扰以引发预测误差，同时结合问卷和EEG记录神经活动。

Result: 更高的沉浸度增强了自我临场感而非物理临场感，准确性和速度随时间提高。神经层面，感觉运动干扰在FCz和Pz引发了显著的事件相关电位效应，伴随额中线θ波和后部α波抑制。PCC的α活动仅在视觉-触觉沉浸中对干扰表现出更高敏感性。

Conclusion: 更高的沉浸度会同时放大感觉运动一致性的益处和代价，PCC的α活动可能是衡量沉浸式VR中感觉运动干扰影响的关键神经标记。

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) can create compelling experiences that evoke presence,
the sense of ``being there.'' However, problems in rendering can create
sensorimotor disruptions that undermine presence and task performance. Presence
is typically assessed with post-hoc questionnaires, but their coarse temporal
resolution limits insight into how sensorimotor disruptions shape user
experience. Here, we combined questionnaires with electroencephalography (EEG)
to identify neural markers of presence-affecting prediction error in immersive
VR. Twenty-five participants performed a grasp-and-place task under two levels
of immersion (visual-only vs.~visuo-haptic). Occasional oddball-like
sensorimotor disruptions introduced premature feedback to elicit prediction
errors. Overall, higher immersion enhanced self-presence but not physical
presence, while accuracy and speed improved over time irrespective of
immersion. At the neural level, sensorimotor disruptions elicited robust
event-related potential effects at FCz and Pz, accompanied by increases in
frontal midline $\theta$ and posterior $\alpha$ suppression. Through source
analyses localized to anterior- and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC/PCC) we
found that PCC $\alpha$ activity showed heightened sensitivity to disruptions
exclusively in visuo-haptic immersion. Exploratory moderation analyses by
presence scores revealed no consistent patterns. Together, these results
suggest that higher immersion amplifies both the benefits and costs of
sensorimotor coherence.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 比较了人类主导的反思式协作与模型主导的主动式协作对创意生成的影响，发现模型主导模式能提高创意质量但降低多样性和用户所有权感，而反思式模式在提高质量的同时保持了多样性和所有权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同人机协作模式对共同创造结果的影响，特别是接口设计在LLM支持创意任务中的作用。

Method: 进行随机对照实验（N=486），比较两种反思式人类主导模式（LLM通过建议或问题引导阐述）与一种主动式模型主导模式（LLM独立重写想法）。

Result: 模型主导模式显著提高了创意质量，但降低了创意多样性和用户的感知所有权；反思式人类主导模式也提高了创意质量，同时保持了多样性和所有权。

Conclusion: 设计生成式AI系统时应将其作为反思性思维伙伴，补充人类优势并增强创意过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential to support creative tasks,
but the role of the interface design is poorly understood. In particular, the
effect of different modes of collaboration between humans and LLMs on
co-creation outcomes is unclear. To test this, we conducted a randomized
controlled experiment ($N = 486$) comparing: (a) two variants of reflective,
human-led modes in which the LLM elicits elaboration through suggestions or
questions, against (b) a proactive, model-led mode in which the LLM
independently rewrites ideas. By assessing the effects on idea quality,
diversity, and perceived ownership, we found that the model-led mode
substantially improved idea quality but reduced idea diversity and users'
perceived idea ownership. The reflective, human-led mode also improved idea
quality, yet while preserving diversity and ownership. Our findings highlight
the importance of designing interactions with generative AI systems as
reflective thought partners that complement human strengths and augment
creative processes.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI作为基础设施在街道环境中的部署现状，分析了AI在街道中的隐形存在及其与公众之间的互动挑战，提出了通过设计干预创建'日常AI观测站'的方法来促进公众参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在街道环境中日益普及（如自动驾驶汽车、面部识别、智能广告牌等），但公众往往对其存在缺乏认知。这种AI的隐形存在与公众参与之间的矛盾促使研究者探索如何在街道环境中促进公众对AI的理解和参与。

Method: 结合AI的社会文化研究、设计研究和科学技术研究视角，在英国和澳大利亚的五个城市街道进行参与式观察，创建'日常AI观测站'作为设计干预手段，分析街道作为'物质参与'场所的可能性。

Result: 研究发现三个主要矛盾：1）街道作为交易环境的框架化；2）AI及其公众在街道中的设计隐形；3）通过统计治理对街道环境的分层。基于这些发现，提出了AI基础设施与日常公众之间的'互惠赤字'概念。

Conclusion: AI在街道中的社会隐形性影响了公众对AI的参与程度，也对城市治理的公众信任产生了影响。需要重新思考如何建立AI基础设施与公众之间更好的互惠关系。

Abstract: The street has emerged as a primary site where everyday publics are
confronted with AI as an infrastructural phenomenon, as machine learning-based
systems are now commonly deployed in this setting in the form of automated
cars, facial recognition, smart billboards and the like. While these
deployments of AI in the street have attracted significant media attention and
public controversy in recent years, the presence of AI in the street often
remains inscrutable, and many everyday publics are unaware of it. In this
paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of everyday public
engagement with AI in the situated environment of city streets under these
paradoxical conditions. Combining perspectives and approaches from social and
cultural studies of AI, Design Research and Science and Technology Studies
(STS), we explore the affordances of the street as a site for 'material
participation' in AI through design-based interventions: the creation of
'everyday AI observatories.' We narrate and reflect on our participatory
observations of AI in five city streets in the UK and Australia and highlight a
set of tensions that emerged from them: 1) the framing of the street as a
transactional environment, 2) the designed invisibility of AI and its publics
in the street 3) the stratification of street environments through statistical
governance. Based on this discussion and drawing on Jane Jacobs' notion of
"eyes on the street," we put forward the relational notion of "reciprocity
deficits" between AI infrastructures and everyday publics in the street. The
conclusion reflects on the consequences of this form of social invisibility of
AI for situated engagement with AI by everyday publics in the street and for
public trust in urban governance.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出使用AI代理代表散户投资者行使投票权，解决共同基金投票权集中在少数资产管理人手中的问题，为股东民主提供新的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共同基金将投票权集中在少数资产管理人手中，这些管理人缺乏对个体股东偏好的了解，使散户投资者缺乏对投资的控制权，同时面临日益增长的政治和监管压力。

Method: 提出使用基于个体股东偏好训练的AI代表作为代理，代替散户投资者投票。这些AI模型不仅能预测投资者当前的投票倾向，还能预测他们在拥有更多时间、知识和资源时的投票选择。

Result: AI代理可以更准确地代表散户投资者的利益，随着时间的推移，能够做出更好的整体决策。

Conclusion: 股东民主为AI代理代表提供了一个有前景的现实测试场景，这种方法既展示了潜在益处，也揭示了相关风险，为更广泛地应用AI代表提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: A large share of retail investors hold public equities through mutual funds,
yet lack adequate control over these investments. Indeed, mutual funds
concentrate voting power in the hands of a few asset managers. These managers
vote on behalf of shareholders despite having limited insight into their
individual preferences, leaving them exposed to growing political and
regulatory pressures, particularly amid rising shareholder activism.
Pass-through voting has been proposed as a way to empower retail investors and
provide asset managers with clearer guidance, but it faces challenges such as
low participation rates and the difficulty of capturing highly individualized
shareholder preferences for each specific vote. Randomly selected assemblies of
shareholders, or ``investor assemblies,'' have also been proposed as more
representative proxies than asset managers. As a third alternative, we propose
artificial intelligence (AI) enabled representatives trained on individual
shareholder preferences to act as proxies and vote on their behalf. Over time,
these models could not only predict how retail investors would vote at any
given moment but also how they might vote if they had significantly more time,
knowledge, and resources to evaluate each proposal, leading to better overall
decision-making. We argue that shareholder democracy offers a compelling
real-world test bed for AI-enabled representation, providing valuable insights
into both the potential benefits and risks of this approach more generally.
