Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于U-Mamba架构的人机协同机器学习方法，用于改进3D解剖结构分割和重建算法的泛化能力，在乳腺癌MRI数据上取得了优异的分割性能，并展示了在临床规划和患者教育中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在处理多样化数据集时泛化能力不足，需要开发能够准确分割解剖结构并适用于不同成像场景的算法，以支持有效的术前规划。

Method: 处理120例回顾性乳腺MRI数据，包括匿名化、手动分割T1加权和动态对比增强序列；采用配准技术分割整个乳房、纤维腺体组织和肿瘤；使用ITK-SNAP进行3D可视化；引入人机协同方法，利用U-Mamba架构优化分割结果。

Result: U-Mamba模型表现出色：整体器官DSC为0.97±0.013，纤维腺体组织为0.96±0.024，肿瘤为0.82±0.12；成功生成准确的3D重建图像；临床访谈显示改善了术前规划、术中导航和决策支持；3D可视化增强了患者教育和沟通效果。

Conclusion: 这种人机协同机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划，并通过更有效的患者教育促进了共同决策和知情选择，具有广泛的医学应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络自动分割辐照后TRISO燃料颗粒的微观图像层结构，以替代繁琐且主观的人工分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辐照过程中TRISO颗粒内核膨胀和缓冲层致密化等现象需要统计分析，但人工分析数千个颗粒既繁琐又主观，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 构建包含2000多张辐照TRISO颗粒微观图像的数据集，使用RU-Net、U-Net、ResNet和Attention U-Net等CNN架构进行自动图像分割

Result: 基于RU-Net的模型在交并比(IoU)指标上表现最佳，能够显著加速TRISO颗粒截面分析并提高分割结果的客观性

Conclusion: CNN方法可以有效自动化TRISO燃料颗粒的微观结构分析，减少人工劳动并提高分析结果的客观性和效率

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

*Abigail R. Cohen,Yuming Sun,Zhihao Qin,Harsh S. Muriki,Zihao Xiao,Yeonju Lee,Matthew Housley,Andrew F. Sharkey,Rhuanito S. Ferrarezi,Jing Li,Lu Gan,Yongsheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种分层管道，使用多光谱成像和自编码器进行异常检测，以及植被指数+随机森林和视觉变换器两种状态估计方法，实现了高效的养分管理早期预警和状态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前养分管理方法需要冗长分析，无法实时优化；成像技术虽然快速但计算密集，难以在资源受限环境下部署。需要开发灵活高效的方法来实现实时作物养分监测。

Method: 采用分层管道：1）使用自编码器进行异常检测和早期预警；2）比较两种状态估计模块：植被指数特征+随机森林机器学习方法，以及原始全图像深度学习的视觉变换器方法。基于养分耗竭实验（三种施肥处理）和多光谱成像数据。

Result: 高效异常检测（移植后9天检测到73%的T3样本），能耗远低于浪费氮素的隐含能量。状态估计显示权衡关系：ViT在磷和钙估计上优于RF（R2 0.61 vs 0.58, 0.48 vs 0.35），但能耗更高。

Conclusion: 该模块化管道为边缘诊断和农业可持续发展提供了实用机会，实现了效率与准确性之间的平衡，支持实时作物养分管理优化。

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor是一个包含2800个标注多格漫画的基准数据集，用于评估大型多模态模型在理解多模态幽默和识别叙事序列方面的能力。实验显示当前最先进模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默理解是社会智能的核心方面，但对大型多模态模型(LMMs)仍是一个重大挑战。需要建立一个基准来评估LMMs在多模态幽默理解和叙事推理方面的能力。

Method: 引入PixelHumor基准数据集，包含2800个标注的多格漫画，用于评估模型的多模态幽默理解和叙事序列识别能力。通过实验测试了最先进的LMMs在这些任务上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示当前顶级模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%的准确率，远低于人类表现水平，表明现有模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在严重局限性。

Conclusion: PixelHumor提供了一个严格的评估框架，用于评估多模态上下文和叙事推理能力，旨在推动开发能够更好地参与自然、具有社会意识交互的LMMs。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线人-物交互(HOI)生成与感知新任务，基于Mamba框架开发了OnlineHOI网络架构，通过记忆机制整合历史信息，在多个在线任务上取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOI方法采用离线设置，可以从整个交互序列获取信息，但现实世界场景中每个时间步只能获取当前和历史信息。研究发现离线方法在在线环境下表现不佳，因此需要专门针对在线场景的解决方案。

Method: 提出OnlineHOI框架，基于Mamba框架构建网络架构，采用记忆机制有效整合历史信息，利用Mamba对流数据的强大建模能力来处理在线HOI任务。

Result: 在Core4D和OAKINK2在线生成任务以及在线HOI4D感知任务上取得了state-of-the-art的结果，证明了该方法在在线环境下的有效性。

Conclusion: 在线HOI任务具有重要实际意义，提出的OnlineHOI框架通过结合Mamba的流数据处理能力和记忆机制，成功解决了离线方法在在线场景中的性能问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了深度学习技术特别是Deepfake技术对社会带来的双重影响，既展示了技术进步，也带来了隐私、声誉和国家安全方面的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习技术特别是Deepfake技术在各个领域的应用及其对社会产生的正负面影响，重点关注其对隐私、政治安全和面部识别系统的潜在威胁。

Method: 通过分析深度学习技术的发展现状，特别是Deepfake技术的应用案例，评估其对社会的多方面影响。

Result: 研究发现Deepfake技术能够产生难以区分的伪造图像和视频，对个人隐私、政治人物声誉和国家安全构成严重威胁，可能破坏选举活动和面部识别系统功能。

Conclusion: 深度学习技术特别是Deepfake技术虽然具有创新价值，但其滥用可能对社会造成严重危害，需要加强监管和技术防范措施。

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏置(SB)与图像分类任务性能之间的关系，提出了频率感知的SB测量方法，并发现SB强度与不同任务的性能存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏置(SB)影响泛化能力，但现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，缺乏对大模型SB的测量方法及其在不同图像分类任务中作用的理解。

Method: 1) 理论分析现有复杂度测量方法的局限性；2) 提出频率感知的SB测量方法；3) 在CLIP模型上应用两种SB调制方法进行验证；4) 分析SB与零样本和微调设置下图像分类任务性能的关系。

Result: 新提出的频率感知SB测量方法比现有方法更具信息性和一致性；SB强度与不同任务性能呈现相关性：更强的SB与更好的OOD泛化性能相关，但与对抗鲁棒性性能的关系不同。

Conclusion: 模型归纳偏置与目标任务特性的对齐对性能有重要影响，SB的调节应根据具体任务需求进行优化。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm是一个基于群体图神经网络的皮肤镜分类框架，首次在ISIC规模上融合图像、毫米级校准和元数据，显著优于仅使用图像的基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤镜AI主要依赖图像而忽略患者元数据（年龄、性别、部位）和物理尺度信息，限制了几何分析的准确性

Method: 使用U-Net进行病变和标尺分割，通过1D-CNN回归像素-毫米比例，计算真实尺度描述符，构建包含元数据和几何相似性的图结构，采用谱GNN进行半监督节点分类

Result: 标尺和病变分割Dice分别达到0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型AUC达到0.9812，稀疏图（约25%边）保持AUC 0.9788，显著优于图像基线（0.9440）

Conclusion: 融合校准尺度、病变几何和元数据的群体图方法在皮肤镜分类中表现优异，稀疏图可保持接近最优精度，为高效部署提供了可能

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了位置感知文本图像机器翻译(PATIMT)任务，构建了包含10个真实场景的基准测试集PATIMTBench，通过自适应OCR优化流程和人工标注测试集，使紧凑型大视觉语言模型在两个子任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TIMT研究主要关注图像中所有文本的翻译，但忽略了提供边界框和覆盖有限场景的问题。本文旨在支持细粒度、保持布局的翻译，具有重要实用价值但尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出PATIMT任务，包含区域特定翻译和带定位的全图像翻译两个子任务。构建PATIMTBench基准，采用自适应图像OCR优化流程根据场景选择合适OCR工具并优化文本丰富图像的结果。构建包含1200个高质量实例的人工标注测试集。

Result: 在本文数据上微调后，紧凑型大视觉语言模型在两个子任务上都达到了最先进的性能。实验结果还显示了训练数据的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PATIMT任务具有重要实用价值，提出的基准测试集和方法能够有效支持现有模型进行位置感知文本图像翻译，为这一新兴领域提供了可靠的研究基础。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SimMemDA框架解决SAR与光学图像间的跨模态域适应问题，通过相似性引导和记忆引导机制提升船尾迹检测的准确性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的船尾迹特征抽象且噪声多，标注困难；光学图像视觉线索清晰但存在域偏移问题，直接迁移会导致性能下降

Method: 使用WakeGAN进行风格迁移生成伪SAR图像，设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制筛选目标样分布样本，引入特征-置信度记忆库和K近邻置信度加权融合策略动态校准伪标签，结合区域混合训练增强泛化

Result: 实验结果表明SimMemDA方法能显著提高跨模态船尾迹检测任务的准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了光学到SAR图像的域适应挑战，验证了相似性引导和记忆引导机制在跨模态检测中的有效性和可行性

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Amplifier Air-Transformer方法，通过数据驱动和物理引导的深度学习，生成美国本土2公里分辨率的小时级气温数据，填补了气象站和卫星数据的时空空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有气温监测中气象站连续但空间覆盖有限、卫星空间覆盖广但存在云遮挡的问题，实现无缝的时空连续气温数据。

Method: 使用神经网络重建GOES-16被云遮挡的地表温度数据，编码年温度周期，通过线性项放大ERA5温度值，卷积层捕捉时空变化；再用另一神经网络将重建的地表温度转换为气温；采用深度集成学习进行预测不确定性估计。

Result: 基于777亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站气温记录（2018-2024年），在站点验证中达到1.93°C的小时气温映射精度。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了地表温度重建和气温预测流程，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高时空分辨率的气温无缝监测。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

Motivation: 研究在动物重识别任务中，通用预训练模型与领域专用模型在后处理度量学习中的表现差异，探索特征空间重塑的局限性。

Method: 使用K近邻分类器配合鲁棒阈值处理，比较DINOv2和MegaDescriptor作为骨干网络的效果，并应用三元组学习投影头进行性能提升。

Result: 专用模型MegaDescriptor通过三元组学习提升了0.13分，而通用模型DINOv2仅提升0.03分（基于BAKS和BAUS平均指标）。可视化显示通用模型的特征空间难以有效重塑。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose

K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上表现优于原版GhostNetV3，达到93.94%准确率，但所有知识蒸馏方法都降低了性能，表明架构适配比蒸馏更重要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在资源受限边缘设备上的部署问题，特别是在低分辨率输入场景下的高效推理需求

Method: 提出GhostNetV3-Small架构适配低分辨率输入，并比较了传统知识蒸馏、教师助理和教师集成等多种蒸馏技术

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上显著优于原版模型，但所有蒸馏策略都导致准确率下降

Conclusion: 在小规模图像分类任务中，架构适配比知识蒸馏更具影响力，需要在低分辨率领域进一步研究有效的模型设计和先进蒸馏技术

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MechBench基准数据集和DYNAMO神经网络模型，用于从CAD点云预测齿轮组件的耦合运动轨迹，解决了传统方法依赖简化运动学结构或关节标注的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对日常铰接物体的运动理解通常假设简化的运动学结构或依赖关节标注，但对于齿轮等机械组件，运动源于几何耦合（如啮合齿或对齐轴），难以仅从几何形状推断关系运动。

Method: 引入MechBench数据集（包含693个合成齿轮组件及其零件级真实运动轨迹），并提出DYNAMO模型——一个依赖感知的神经网络，直接从分割的CAD点云预测每个零件的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: 实验表明DYNAMO在多种齿轮配置下优于强基线方法，实现了准确且时间一致的运动预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了一个新颖的系统框架，用于数据驱动的CAD组件中耦合机械运动学习。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet是准确高效的田间部署解决方案，为自动化棉花采摘和高通量表型分析提供可靠技术基础

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Conclusion: TSDF框架成功解决了青光眼预后中的变长序列处理和多数据集整合问题，为临床实践提供了灵活高效的解决方案

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成模型在预构建的潜在空间中捕获图像分布，但重建分布与生成分布存在显著差异。现有tokenizer只关注重建任务，未考虑生成过程中的错误。

Method: 提出主训练阶段使用潜在扰动策略模拟采样噪声，后训练阶段针对训练好的生成模型优化tokenizer解码器。还提出了新的评估指标pFID。

Result: 使用约4亿参数的生成器，经过主训练的tokenizer达到1.60 gFID，后训练后进一步提升到1.36 gFID。方法在离散和连续tokenizer以及自回归和扩散生成器上都有效。

Conclusion: 提出的tokenizer训练方案能有效减少重建与生成分布差异，提升生成质量，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

TL;DR: 提出了GRT（Generalizable Radar Transformer）基础模型，使用100万样本训练，能够从单芯片毫米波雷达数据预测3D占用和语义分割，性能接近高分辨率传感器，并展示了良好的泛化能力和数据缩放特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达虽然成本低、耐用且不受环境条件影响，但角分辨率较差。现有方法缺乏标准化的基础模型和大规模数据集，通常需要从小数据集从头训练任务特定模型。

Method: 收集了100万样本（29小时）的最大原始雷达数据集，训练了基于Transformer的GRT基础模型，使用原始雷达数据而非有损表示，能够进行3D占用和语义分割预测。

Result: GRT在多样化设置中表现出良好的泛化能力，可以针对不同任务进行微调，数据缩放呈现每10倍数据20%的对数增长。使用原始数据相比有损表示相当于10倍训练数据的提升。

Conclusion: GRT展示了毫米波雷达基础模型的潜力，估计需要约1亿样本（3000小时）数据才能充分发挥其潜力，为低成本雷达的高精度感知应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态任务中取得了显著成功，但它们在噪声条件下的鲁棒性仍然不为人所知，需要系统性的评估来理解模型在不同噪声类型下的表现。

Method: 使用受控扰动（光照变化、运动模糊、压缩伪影）对多个SOTA VLMs进行测试，采用基于词汇的指标（BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE、CIDEr）和基于神经网络的句子嵌入相似度度量来量化语义对齐。

Result: 实验发现：(1) 真实标注的描述性显著影响模型性能；(2) 大型模型如LLaVA在语义理解方面表现优异，但并非在所有情况下都优于小型模型；(3) JPEG压缩和运动模糊等特定噪声类型会显著降低所有模型的性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型大小、数据集特征和噪声鲁棒性之间的微妙权衡关系，为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供了标准化基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设立了新的基准，为像素级标注不可用或成本过高的情况提供了实用解决方案，具有良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four

TL;DR: 本文提出了Agent4FaceForgery多智能体框架，通过LLM驱动的智能体模拟人脸伪造过程，生成具有细粒度文本-图像一致性标签的数据，解决了训练数据生态无效性问题，显著提升了多种检测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸伪造检测面临离线基准与真实世界效果之间的持续差距，主要原因是训练数据的生态无效性。需要解决两个基本问题：如何捕捉人类伪造的多样化意图和迭代过程，以及如何建模社交媒体中伴随伪造的复杂文本-图像交互。

Conclusion: Agent4FaceForgery框架成功解决了人脸伪造检测中的数据生态无效性问题，通过模拟真实世界的伪造过程和文本-图像交互，生成了高质量的训练数据，显著提高了检测性能。

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

*Wenxuan Ji,Haichao Shi,Xiao-Yu zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MGNM（多模态图网络建模）方法，利用GNN的关系结构增强HOI检测，在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法在HOI检测中占主导地位，但无法显式建模关系结构，而GNN天生更适合处理人-物对之间的关系

Method: 设计了一个四阶段图结构的多模态图网络框架，引入多级特征交互机制，利用多级视觉和语言特征增强人-物对间的信息传播

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准上达到state-of-the-art性能，与更先进的目标检测器集成时表现出显著性能提升，并在稀有和非稀有类别间保持有效平衡

Conclusion: GNN-based的MGNM方法通过显式建模关系结构和多级特征交互，有效提升了HOI检测性能，证明了图神经网络在该任务中的优势

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQT-Light是一个基于VQVAE和ViT架构的轻量级光照估计框架，通过离散特征提取和全局上下文建模，在保持40FPS高速推理的同时实现了更好的纹理细节和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照估计方法要么难以恢复光照图的细节纹理，要么在运行速度和纹理保真度方面面临挑战，需要一种既能保持高速又能提供高质量光照估计的解决方案。

Method: 提出VQT-Light框架，包含特征提取和光照估计两个模块：1）使用VQVAE提取光照图的离散特征以避免"后验坍塌"；2）使用ViT而非CNN捕获输入图像的全局上下文和依赖关系，将光照估计建模为多类分类任务。

Result: 模型实现了40FPS的推理速度，在多个评估指标上均有提升，能够预测具有更丰富纹理和更好保真度的光照图。

Conclusion: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法相比现有最先进方法实现了优越的结果，在保持轻量快速的同时显著提升了光照估计的质量。

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于各种一致性蒸馏框架的自适应采样调度器，通过动态目标时间步选择、优化交替采样以及稳定化技术，显著提升了生成性能和应用灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一致性蒸馏方法在目标时间步选择上主要依赖确定性或随机策略，需要为不同蒸馏过程专门设计采样调度器，限制了扩散模型在实际应用中的完整采样潜力。

Method: 提出自适应采样调度器，包含三个创新策略：(1)基于计算重要性的动态目标时间步选择；(2)基于时间步重要性的优化交替采样；(3)使用平滑裁剪和颜色平衡技术实现稳定高质量生成。

Result: 通过全面实验评估验证了自适应采样调度器在各种一致性蒸馏方法中的有效性和灵活性，实验结果表明生成性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了强大的适应性，扩展了一致性蒸馏模型在复杂生成场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型易受视觉不可察觉的对抗攻击影响，但针对自动驾驶定位系统的攻击研究较少，大多数对抗攻击集中在3D感知领域

Method: 逆向工程定位模型（如特征提取网络）识别关键关键点，策略性移除包含Top-K关键点的区域，使用近红外吸收材料在物理世界隐藏关键区域

Result: 在KITTI数据集上测试三个最先进点云配准模型（HRegNet、D3Feat、GeoTransformer），移除关键区域显著降低配准精度；在Autoware平台上隐藏少量关键区域即可引起明显定位漂移；物理世界攻击成功复现KITTI数据中的攻击效果

Conclusion: DisorientLiDAR框架验证了针对LiDAR定位系统的对抗攻击的有效性和通用性，为现实世界物理攻击提供了可行方案，展示了该安全威胁的真实性

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Motivation: 现有反射去除方法仅关注图像域，忽略了反射光的光谱特性变化，无法有效区分反射。反射和透射分量在捕获图像中重叠，导致准确区分和恢复干净背景变得困难。

Method: 1) 提出光谱码本重构反射图像的光谱；2) 设计两个光谱先验精炼模块在空间维度重新分布像素并在波长维度自适应增强光谱差异；3) 提出光谱感知Transformer在光谱和像素域联合恢复透射内容。

Conclusion: 通过光谱学习视角，利用光谱特性差异有效区分反射，提出的光谱码本和光谱感知Transformer能够显著提升反射去除效果，具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 本文提出CIARD方法，通过多教师框架和对比推拉损失对齐解决对抗鲁棒性蒸馏中双教师目标冲突问题，使用连续对抗重训练保持教师模型鲁棒性，在多个数据集上显著提升对抗防御率和干净样本准确率

Conclusion: CIARD方法有效解决了对抗鲁棒性蒸馏中的性能退化问题，通过创新的多教师框架和连续训练机制，在保持模型鲁棒性的同时显著提升了干净样本的性能表现

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个语义对齐的多模态操纵检测数据集SAMM和检索增强的检测框架RamDG，解决了现有基准中跨模态不对齐的问题，在检测准确率上比现有方法提升2.06%


<details>

Motivation: 现有多模态操纵检测基准存在跨模态不对齐问题，人为破坏了模态间的一致性，而真实世界的攻击通常保持语义一致性，这导致现有方法在实际应用中效果不佳

Method: 1) 构建SAMM数据集：采用两阶段流程，先应用先进的图像操纵技术，再生成语义一致的文本叙述；2) 提出RamDG框架：利用外部知识库检索上下文证据，通过图像伪造定位和深度操纵检测模块进行多模态操纵检测

Conclusion: 该研究填补了语义协调多模态操纵检测的空白，提出的数据集和框架为媒体取证提供了更实用的解决方案，代码和数据集已开源

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨视角地理定位中往往忽略空间和语义信息，难以处理显著的外观变化和提取判别性特征。

Method: MFAF方法包含多频率分支块(MFB)和频率感知空间注意力(FSA)模块，分别用于捕获多尺度频率特征和自适应关注关键区域。

Result: 在University-1652、SUES-200和Dense-UAV等基准测试中，MFAF方法在无人机定位和导航任务中均取得竞争优势。

Conclusion: 该方法通过频率特征的多尺度融合和注意力机制，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对YOLOv8到YOLOv11四个版本在海洋图像检测任务上的性能进行了系统比较，发现在水下环境中YOLOv9后准确度趋于饱和，而YOLOv10在速度和精度平衡方面表现最佳，适合自主水下航行器部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主水下航行器(AUVs)依赖计算机视觉系统进行海洋监测任务，但水下图像存在光照衰减、浑浊和类别不平衡等问题，且AUV计算资源有限。需要评估最新YOLO检测器在海洋领域的实际性能。

Method: 使用两个公开海洋数据集（珊瑚疾病和鱼类物种），创建四种训练规模，在相同超参数下训练YOLOv8-s到YOLOv11-s四个版本，评估精度、召回率、mAP、推理时间等指标，并进行Grad-CAM可视化分析。

Result: 在两个数据集上，准确度在YOLOv9后达到饱和，后续版本主要提升效率而非准确度。推理速度显著改善，YOLOv10在速度和精度平衡方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: YOLOv10为嵌入式AUV部署提供了最佳的速度-精度权衡，研究提供了首个近期YOLO变体在水下图像上的受控比较，并建立了开放的基准和代码库以加速未来海洋视觉研究。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic

the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather

across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The

TL;DR: 提出RIS-FUSION框架，通过联合优化统一图像融合和参考图像分割任务，利用文本指导红外和可见光图像融合，并在新构建的大规模数据集MM-RIS上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动的红外和可见光图像融合方法缺乏目标对齐的任务来监督和评估文本对融合结果的贡献效果。观察到参考图像分割(RIS)和文本驱动融合具有共同目标：突出文本所指的对象。

Method: 提出RIS-FUSION级联框架，核心是LangGatedFusion模块，将文本特征注入融合主干网络以增强语义对齐。构建了包含12.5k训练和3.5k测试样本的MM-RIS多模态基准数据集。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化融合和RIS任务，证明了文本指导的图像融合方法的有效性，并提供了大规模数据集支持多模态参考图像分割研究。

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

TL;DR: DeFA通过解构-重构框架进行特征增强和去偏策略，解决组合零样本学习中的属性-对象纠缠和长尾分布问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习面临属性与对象纠缠以及现实数据长尾分布的挑战，受神经科学发现启发，提出通过想象力增强感知能力

Method: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，整合解构-重构框架进行特征增强，并采用去偏策略，利用已见属性和对象先验知识合成高保真组合特征

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上进行了大量实验，证明DeFA在封闭世界和开放世界设置下都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DeFA通过特征增强和去偏策略有效解决了组合零样本学习中的关键挑战，为组合泛化提供了有效支持

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，专门解决视觉-语言模型中视觉和语言处理不对称的问题，通过三种专家组实现模态特定处理和跨模态交互，在减少参数的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言不对称性方面存在挑战，视觉信息具有空间完整性而语言需要保持序列上下文，导致MoE模型难以平衡模态特定特征和跨模态交互。

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三种专家组：模态内专家处理模态特定信息，双曲跨模态专家处理层次化跨模态交互，证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏差并保持上下文基础。

Result: 实验表明AsyMoE相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别实现了26.58%和15.45%的准确率提升，同时比密集模型减少了25.45%的激活参数。

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言不对称性，有效解决了现有MoE方法的局限性，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间推理基准主要关注静态或全局可观察环境，无法捕捉在部分可观察性和动态变化下的长时程推理和记忆利用挑战。

Method: 设计了两个动态空间基准测试，每个动作都会触发环境结构变化，需要持续更新认知和策略。提出了基于主观经验的记忆机制来实现跨任务经验迁移和验证。

Result: 实验表明该基准测试揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个全面的平台来推动未来方法学进展，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen提出了一种基于球面投影的单视图3D生成方法，通过将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为多层2D表示，解决了现有方法的多视角不一致性问题，同时支持复杂内部结构和拓扑表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视图3D生成模型依赖多视角扩散先验，容易产生视角不一致问题，且无法准确表示复杂内部结构和非平凡拓扑。需要一种能够同时保证一致性、灵活性和效率的新方法。

Method: 将几何信息投影到边界球面上，然后展开为紧凑的多层2D球面投影(SP)表示。完全在图像域操作，利用单视角编码消除视角不一致性，多层SP图表示嵌套内部结构，并支持直接转换为水密或开放3D表面。

Result: 大量实验表明，SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SPGen通过球面投影表示成功解决了单视图3D生成中的视角一致性问题，同时提供了处理复杂内部结构的灵活性，并保持了计算效率，为3D生成领域提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型(VLMs)能力强大，但存在越狱攻击漏洞。现有攻击方法的有效性和效率仍有提升空间，研究发现将弱防御融入攻击流程可以显著增强越狱效果

Method: Defense2Attack包含三个核心组件：1)视觉优化器嵌入具有肯定语义的通用对抗扰动；2)文本优化器使用防御风格提示优化输入；3)红队后缀生成器通过强化微调增强越狱效果

Result: 在4个VLMs和4个安全基准测试中，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中实现了优越的越狱性能，超越了需要多次尝试的最先进攻击方法

Conclusion: 这项工作为越狱VLMs提供了新的视角，证明利用防御模式可以更有效地绕过模型的安全防护机制

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Conclusion: WaveVerse提供了一个可扩展的RF感知仿真解决方案，能够生成高质量的RF数据，为RF成像和人体活动识别等应用提供了有效的数据支持。

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Motivation: 针对当前高斯泼溅方法中属性分配不加区分导致梯度冲突的问题，需要开发更有效的高斯管理策略来提升物体重建的保真度和效率。

Method: 提出动态激活球谐函数或法向量的致密化策略，在表面重建模块监督下缓解双监督梯度冲突；开发轻量化高斯表示，基于梯度幅度自适应调整SH阶数，并进行任务解耦剪枝来移除对重建任务影响最小的高斯。

Conclusion: 该高斯管理方法是模型无关的，可无缝集成到其他框架中，在提升性能的同时减少模型大小，为高保真物体重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了ConvNeXt架构深度可分离网络中学习的感受野滤波器，通过聚类得到8个主关键滤波器，并建立了基于高斯核离散模拟的数学模型来近似这些学习到的滤波器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度可分离卷积网络中学习到的滤波器的数学特性，验证这些滤波器是否可以通过离散尺度空间滤波器来建模和近似。

Method: 首先计算学习滤波器的空间扩散度量（加权均值和方差），然后使用高斯核离散模拟的差分算子来建模主关键滤波器，通过两种方式拟合模型：不同方向尺度参数和相同尺度参数，并使用l1/l2范数最小化或空间方差相等的方法进行模型拟合。

Result: 研究表明学习到的滤波器可以通过可分离的空间滤波操作建模，非中心滤波器的空间偏移接近半个网格单位，理想化模型与学习滤波器具有良好的定性相似性，并且在深度可分离网络中替换为理想化滤波器后仍保持良好预测性能。

Conclusion: 深度可分离深度网络中学习到的滤波器可以很好地用离散尺度空间滤波器来近似，这为理解卷积神经网络中滤波器学习机制提供了数学理论基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态LLM与人类在评估文本生成图像质量时的差异，发现LLM在理解图像美学、解剖准确性等属性方面与人类存在显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估文本生成图像模型的质量仍然是一个挑战，现有研究使用多模态LLM来评判图像质量，但缺乏对这些模型如何利用人类相关概念（如图像风格、构图等）来生成整体评估的深入理解

Method: 首先通过合成生成的图像对构建人类偏好数据集，使用任务间相关性分析来理解各图像质量属性在人类判断中的关系；然后对LLM进行相同分析；最后为每个质量属性生成高度可控的合成数据集进行单独研究

Result: 人类能够轻松判断所有特定图像质量属性，但多模态LLM在某些属性（如解剖准确性）上学习判断的能力较差；人类判断中各质量属性之间存在较强相关性，而LLM中这些关系要弱得多

Conclusion: 研究发现揭示了人类和多模态LLM在图像感知方面存在有趣差异，为改进自动图像质量评估提供了重要见解

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将跨视角物体地理定位视为一次性检测任务，直接回归物体位置，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏错误校正机制。

Method: 提出ReCOT框架：1）使用可学习token编码查询图像和提示嵌入的任务特定意图；2）迭代注意力机制逐步优化预测位置；3）SAM知识蒸馏策略转移分割先验知识；4）参考特征增强模块通过分层注意力强调物体相关区域。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时比之前的SOTA方法减少60%的参数。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环定位框架和知识蒸馏策略有效解决了跨视角物体地理定位中的噪声和错误校正问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线摄影测量流程，存在延迟问题，且质量可能因相机位姿不准确、数字表面模型错误和场景遮挡而下降，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: 基于在线3DGS优化，每获取一张图像就通过在线SfM计算位姿和稀疏点云，将新高斯集成并优化到未重建或粗重建区域，结合正交泼溅技术实现实时渲染。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的初步实验表明，A-TDOM能够以近实时方式主动渲染TDOM，每张新图像的3DGS优化仅需数秒，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和几何精度。

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法成功解决了传统TDOM生成的实时性问题，为城市管理、城市规划等领域的实时应用提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BATR-FST是一个用于少样本学习的双层次自适应令牌精炼方法，通过令牌聚类、不确定性感知加权和双层次注意力机制，在Vision Transformers上实现了优异的少样本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在少样本学习中面临令牌级交互精炼困难、训练数据有限和归纳偏置不足的挑战，现有方法依赖不灵活的令牌匹配或基础相似性度量，限制了全局上下文和局部特征精炼的有效整合。

Method: 提出BATR-FST两阶段方法：预训练阶段使用掩码图像建模提供可迁移的补丁级表示；元微调阶段包含双层次自适应令牌精炼模块（令牌聚类、不确定性感知令牌加权、双层次注意力机制）、图令牌传播确保支持集和查询集语义一致性，以及类分离惩罚保持类间边界。

Result: 在三个基准少样本数据集上的广泛实验表明，BATR-FST在1-shot和5-shot场景下均取得了优异结果，显著提升了基于Transformer的少样本分类性能。

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过渐进式令牌表示改进和保持强归纳偏置，有效解决了Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的挑战，为少样本分类提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤高度异质性和变异性给精确亚型诊断带来挑战，现有方法未能有效利用放射科医生诊断工作流中常用的多期相CECT上下文信息

Method: 使用Mamba架构进行时空建模，提出双层次对比增强感知模块（包含新颖的空间和时间采样序列）、相似性引导精炼模块、空间互补集成器和多粒度融合模块

Result: 在270例临床病例的内部数据集上，区分胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）和胰腺神经内分泌肿瘤（PNETs）的准确率达到97.4%，AUC为98.6%

Conclusion: 该方法可作为更准确高效的胰腺肿瘤亚型诊断工具，首次实现了多期相CECT数据的自动组合用于胰腺肿瘤亚型鉴别

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文表示学习网络，通过整合功能推理和上下文提示来改进人-物交互检测，在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有两阶段方法在上下文建模不完整的问题，特别是对于涉及工具等辅助实体的复杂交互场景

Method: 扩展传统人-物对检测框架，引入三元组结构<人,工具,物体>来建模辅助对象的功能角色，并使用可学习提示与视觉特征通过注意力机制进行整合

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集的大多数场景中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 通过上下文化表示学习，模型能够更好地捕捉复杂、依赖上下文的交互关系，为可靠推理提供丰富的关联线索

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: DH-Diff成功解决了合成异常数据生成中的关键挑战，为制造业视觉异常检测提供了有效的合成数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Motivation: 传统超像素方法依赖低层特征，而深度学习方法虽然利用高层特征但往往牺牲规则性来捕捉复杂物体，导致分割结果准确但可解释性差。需要一种既能保持准确性又能保证规则性的超像素分割方法。

Method: 提出SPAM框架：训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，在推理时利用大规模预训练模型进行语义无关分割，确保超像素与物体掩码对齐。能够处理任何先验高层分割，解决不确定区域，并支持交互式聚焦特定物体。

Result: 综合实验表明，SPAM在分割任务的质量和量化指标上都优于最先进的方法，成为各种应用中有价值且鲁棒的工具。

Conclusion: SPAM提供了一个多功能框架，能够生成准确且规则的超像素分割，解决了现有方法在准确性和规则性之间的权衡问题，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性注意力通过均匀压缩历史KV信息来降低计算复杂度，但会导致特征冗余和方向对齐丢失，造成性能差距

Method: 引入输入自适应的可学习门控选择性调制KV特征图的信息聚合，增强语义多样性并缓解低秩约束；提出高效的Hadamard乘积分解方法计算门控

Result: 在1280×1280分辨率下相比PVT-T实现1.76倍吞吐量提升和2.69倍峰值GPU内存减少；在ImageNet上top-1准确率提升达4.4%

Conclusion: SAGA在线性注意力框架内有效解决了特征冗余和低秩约束问题，实现了计算效率和模型性能的双重提升

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

<details>

Motivation: 医学影像基础模型受限于较小的数据集规模，需要系统研究数据规模和预训练范式如何影响医学影像领域的性能表现。

Method: 使用来自单一机构的350万张胸部X光片，持续预训练MI2（CLIP范式）和RAD-DINO（DINOv2范式）两种视觉编码器，保持计算资源和评估协议一致，评估分类、分割和放射报告生成任务。

Result: MI2在发现相关任务上扩展性更好，RAD-DINO在导管相关任务上表现更强；使用UniCL同时结合报告和结构化标签持续预训练MI2能提升性能；某些任务仅需3万张域内样本即可超越开放权重基础模型。

Conclusion: 医学机构利用域内数据进行持续预训练可以带来显著的性能提升，证明了机构特定持续预训练的实用价值。

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据具有巨大潜力，特别适用于罕见疾病中的数据稀缺问题，该方法虽针对医疗领域设计但可适配其他领域

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

Conclusion: CCS为DevOps风格的目标检测器监控提供了稳健的基础，能够突出表现不佳的场景，实现无标注的持续评估。

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Motivation: 解决现有指令图像编辑方法对训练域外指令泛化能力不足的问题，提升实际应用中的实用性。

Conclusion: Lego-Edit通过MLLM的组织能力和强化学习训练，有效解决了指令图像编辑的泛化问题，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Motivation: Rectified Flow模型在生成性能上优于DDIM-based扩散模型，但在实际应用中面临两个主要挑战：低反演精度影响源图像一致性，以及多模态注意力纠缠阻碍精确注意力控制。

Method: 1) 基于Runge-Kutta微分方程求解器的高效高阶反演方法；2) 解耦扩散变换器注意力机制(DDTA)，将文本和图像注意力在多模态扩散变换器中进行解耦。

Result: 在图像重建和文本引导编辑任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在保真度和可编辑性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了Rectified Flow模型的两个关键挑战，实现了更高的反演精度和更精确的语义控制，为实际应用提供了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术三重识别面临长尾数据分布问题，现有多任务学习方法存在任务间表示纠缠导致的优化冲突，以及类别不平衡导致的训练冲突

Method: MEJO框架包含：1) S²D学习方案分解任务共享和特定表示；2) MLLM驱动的概率提示池增强视觉特征；3) 协调梯度学习策略重新平衡头尾类梯度

Result: 在CholecT45和CholecT50数据集上的广泛实验证明了该框架的优越性

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效处理了优化冲突，在手术三重识别任务中表现出色

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making

release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS)方法，通过视觉记忆机制在LVLM各层间平滑注意力分布，使模型能持续关注关键对象，显著提升视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)虽然能准确定位图像中的关键对象，但对这些对象的注意力往往很短暂。假设持续关注关键对象可以提升LVLMs的视觉能力。

Method: CLVS方法包含视觉记忆机制：1）在第一层使用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化视觉记忆；2）后续层中，视觉注意力联合考虑前层的视觉记忆；3）迭代更新记忆以保持对关键对象的平滑注意力；4）使用不确定性作为视觉理解完成的指标来终止平滑过程。

Result: 在三个LVLMs的四个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和泛化性。CLVS在各种视觉理解任务上达到最先进性能，特别是在关系和属性理解方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过跨层视觉平滑机制，CLVS能够有效提升LVLMs对关键对象的持续关注能力，从而显著改善视觉理解性能，特别是在复杂的关系和属性理解任务上。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

*Guihui Li,Bowei Dong,Kaizhi Dong,Jiayi Li,Haiyong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion是一个基于多模态场景图的红外与可见光图像融合框架，通过结构化场景图显式建模实体、属性和空间关系，在保持细节和结构清晰度方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习融合方法主要依赖低层次视觉线索（如纹理和对比度），难以捕捉图像中的高层次语义信息。虽然最近尝试引入文本作为语义指导，但非结构化的描述无法显式建模实体、属性和关系，也缺乏空间定位能力，限制了细粒度融合性能。

Method: 提出MSGFusion框架，通过深度耦合从文本和视觉中提取的结构化场景图，显式表示实体、属性和空间关系，然后通过场景图表示、层次聚合和图驱动融合等连续模块同步优化高层次语义和低层次细节。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MSGFusion在细节保持和结构清晰度方面显著优于最先进方法，在下游任务（如低光目标检测、语义分割和医学图像融合）中表现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSGFusion通过结构化场景图的深度耦合，成功解决了红外与可见光图像融合中高层次语义信息捕捉的挑战，为多模态图像融合提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

Motivation: 医学图像中正常组织的细粒度变异性（如肺部解剖结构）对现有生成式异常检测方法构成主要挑战，需要开发能够处理这种变异性的新方法

Method: 采用图像到图像转换进行无异常重建，然后通过观察图像与生成图像对之间的补丁相似性评分来实现精确的异常定位

Result: 在胸部CT感染性病变检测和脑部MRI缺血性卒中病变分割任务中，像素级异常分割性能显著提升，DICE分数相对改进分别为+1.9%和+4.4%

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理医学图像中的正常组织变异性，在多个医学成像模态中实现了优于现有最先进重建方法的异常检测和分割性能

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器主要关注空间线索而忽略时间依赖性，在长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性有限；基于相关的孪生跟踪器受限于线性相关操作，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，增强时间一致性并实现更丰富的特征表示

Result: 相比基线方法，成功率提升13.7%，精确度提升14.7%；在Jetson Nano上实时运行7.1FPS，计算效率高

Conclusion: 时间建模对孪生跟踪框架至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了一个强大而高效的解决方案

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对YOLOv8的三阶段压缩流水线，通过稀疏感知训练、结构化通道剪枝和通道知识蒸馏，在VisDrone数据集上实现73.51%参数减少，推理速度从26FPS提升至68FPS，仅损失少量检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限设备上高效部署深度学习模型进行空中目标检测，需要在保持性能的同时实现显著压缩。

Method: 三阶段压缩流水线：1）稀疏感知训练引入动态稀疏性；2）利用批量归一化缩放因子进行结构化通道剪枝；3）采用通道知识蒸馏（CWD）缓解精度损失，使用可调节温度和损失加权方案。

Result: YOLOv8m参数从25.85M减少到6.85M（减少73.51%），FLOPs从49.6G降到13.3G，MACs从101G降到34.5G，AP50仅下降2.7%。推理速度从26FPS提升到45FPS，结合TensorRT后达到68FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效的模型压缩，在保持检测精度的同时显著提升推理速度，适用于资源受限的高吞吐量场景。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法将点云配准质量验证视为分类任务，只能将质量分配到少数类别中，无法进行精细量化。本文希望通过回归方法实现更细粒度的配准质量评估。

Method: 使用回归方法进行点云配准质量验证，扩展了先前使用的错位相关特征，采用多尺度提取和基于注意力的聚合技术。

Result: 该方法在多样化数据集上实现了准确和鲁棒的配准误差估计，特别是在具有异质空间密度的点云上表现优异。在指导下游建图任务时，相比最先进的基于分类的方法，显著提高了给定重配准帧数下的建图质量。

Conclusion: 基于回归的点云配准质量验证方法比传统分类方法能提供更精细的质量量化，在多尺度特征和注意力机制的加持下，在各种场景下都表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Motivation: 现有的自监督3D重建方法在动态对象重建方面存在困难，主要由于运动估计不准确和时间一致性弱，导致动态场景元素重建不完整或失真。

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态驾驶场景中3D重建的挑战，为自动驾驶系统验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确的动态场景重建能力。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的方法来解决3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在语义理解方面的局限性，通过对象级高斯分解和多视角CLIP特征聚合来实现开放词汇的3D物体提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能够实现实时逼真渲染，但其固有的模糊性限制了在AR/VR和机器人等领域的3D场景理解应用。现有方法通过2D基础模型蒸馏学习语义，但存在alpha混合导致语义平均化的根本限制。

Method: 提出绕过可微分渲染的语义学习范式，利用预分解的对象级高斯，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合为每个对象创建全面的嵌入表示，形成"嵌入包"来整体描述对象。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服了3D开放词汇物体提取的挑战，同时在2D开放词汇分割方面与最先进方法性能相当，确保了最小程度的性能妥协。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景理解提供了新的解决方案，能够实现准确的开放词汇物体检索和无缝的任务适应，为AR/VR和机器人应用提供了更好的3D语义理解能力。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

*Robin Schön,Julian Lorenz,Katja Ludwig,Daniel Kienzle,Rainer Lienhart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户点击的交互式多表面分割方法，支持多模态输入并设计了特殊的网络架构来处理RGB黑盒和快速响应需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像中多个表面同时存在且相互纠缠的分割难题，需要处理多模态输入并满足实时交互需求

Method: 设计网络架构，输入包括RGB图像、非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击，在图像特征提取和多模态融合后整合交互信息

Result: 多模态融合策略有效，在DeLiVER和MFNet数据集上平均减少1.28和1.19次点击，RGB基线在单掩码场景也表现优异

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多表面交互分割问题，多模态输入显著提升性能，网络设计满足实际应用需求

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史手写文档的文本行分割面临独特挑战：不规则笔迹、褪色墨水、复杂布局和重叠行，且缺乏大规模标注数据集，使全监督学习方法不实用。

Method: 采用少样本学习方法，参赛系统仅使用U-DIADS-TL数据集中每份手稿的3张标注图像进行训练，处理具有多样化布局和退化水平的古代手稿。

Result: 竞赛数据集包含多种古代手稿，展现各种布局、退化程度和非标准格式，真实反映实际应用场景。

Conclusion: FEST竞赛通过强调少样本学习，旨在开发鲁棒且适应性强的方法，使人文学者能以最少的手动标注工作使用自动化文档分析工具，促进历史研究中自动化工具的更广泛应用。

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER提出了一种新的权重初始化方法，通过高斯噪声扰动来解决SIREN网络的频谱瓶颈问题，在音频、图像和3D形状拟合任务中取得了最先进的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIREN网络在初始化不当时会出现频谱瓶颈现象，无法有效拟合目标信号频谱，限制了其表示能力。

Method: 提出WINNER方法，使用高斯噪声扰动均匀初始化的权重，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，无需引入额外可训练参数。

Result: 在音频拟合任务中达到最先进水平，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升。

Conclusion: WINNER不仅解决了SIREN的频谱瓶颈问题，还为深度神经网络的自适应目标感知初始化策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose
omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Motivation: 解决从第一人称视频数据中检测用户动作错误的问题，特别是处理细微且不频繁的错误实例所带来的挑战。

Method: 使用双阶段框架：第一阶段通过冻结ViViT模型和LoRA调优ViViT模型提取特征，并通过特征级专家模块组合；第二阶段训练三个具有不同目标的分类器（重加权交叉熵、AUC损失、标签感知损失），并通过分类级专家模块融合预测结果。

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Jinhua Zeng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于现代视觉基础模型(VFM)的简单线性分类器在AI生成图像检测任务中显著优于专用检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%，其优势源于VLM对伪造相关概念的文本-图像对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专用AI生成图像检测器在精心策划的基准测试上表现优异，但在真实场景中失败率极高，假阴性率严重。需要寻找更有效的检测方法来解决这一实际问题。

Method: 使用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)作为特征提取器，在其上训练简单的线性分类器。通过分析文本-图像相似性来探究VLM对伪造相关概念的学习能力，并使用在VFM预训练截止日期后收集的新数据集进行验证。

Result: 基于VFM的基线方法在相同训练数据下显著优于专用检测器，在真实场景准确率提升超过20%。研究发现近期VLM学会了将合成图像与伪造相关概念对齐，但这种能力在未见过的数据上急剧下降。

Conclusion: 1) 更新的VFM原始能力比静态检测器的精心设计更有效；2) 真正的泛化评估需要测试数据独立于模型的整个训练历史，包括预训练阶段。

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Method: 使用脉冲神经网络和神经形态相机（事件相机）构建检测系统，部署在神经形态芯片上，形成完全神经形态系统，可利用合成数据进行训练

Result: 系统能耗比边缘GPU参考方案低几个数量级，可电池供电运行超过一年，模型主要依赖无人机形状而非螺旋桨时间特征进行检测

Conclusion: 该系统体积小、功耗低，易于在争议区域或缺乏电力基础设施的地点部署，可创建虚拟绊网检测无人机进入限制区域

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Conclusion: 提出的Dream3DAvatar框架有效解决了单图像3D头像重建中的遮挡区域控制问题，实现了高质量的文本可控3D头像生成

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL方法直接从LLM移植到VLM效果不佳，因为VLM任务更复杂，需要先准确感知视觉输入才能进行有效推理。

Method: 采用两阶段RL框架：第一阶段通过粗粒度和细粒度视觉理解提升视觉感知能力；第二阶段专注于推理能力增强。使用数据集级采样解决RL训练中的优势消失问题。

Result: 在7个基准数据集上的实验证明该方法有效，PeBR-R1模型在多种视觉推理任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段RL框架成功解决了VLM的感知-推理联合优化问题，显著提升了视觉语言模型的综合能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率大视觉语言模型(HR-LVLMs)通过将高分辨率图像裁剪为局部图块独立编码，虽然提升了细粒度视觉理解能力，但显著增加了视觉token数量，导致计算和内存开销大幅增加

Method: 基于三个关键发现：(1)局部图块重要性不同，由视觉显著性和任务相关性共同决定；(2)CLIP视觉编码器的CLS token在不同层呈现两阶段注意力模式；(3)不同阶段强调的视觉token编码不同粒度的信息。提出HERO框架，整合内容自适应token预算分配和功能感知token选择

Result: 在多样化基准测试和模型规模上实现了优越的效率-精度权衡，所有操作无需训练

Conclusion: 本研究为HR-LVLMs的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案，通过智能token选择和丢弃机制显著提升模型效率

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态对齐和语言语义损失方面存在困难，特别是在包含多个视觉相似对象的复杂场景中，经常出现目标定位错误或不完整分割的问题。

Method: 提出三阶段框架：知识增强阶段(KPS)使用多尺度线性交叉注意力模块(MLAM)进行双向语义交换；知识融合阶段(KFS)通过跨模态特征扫描模块(CFSM)捕获长距离依赖；知识强化阶段(KIS)使用词级语言特征引导的语义深化模块(WFDM)补偿语义退化。

Conclusion: TFANet通过系统性的三阶段特征对齐框架，有效解决了多模态错位和语言语义损失问题，特别适用于复杂场景中的指代图像分割任务。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合使用像素级损失函数，过度关注局部信息可能导致全局信息丢失，需要更有效的傅里叶域信息对齐方法。

Method: 提出U形深度增强网络LLFDisc，集成交叉注意力和门控机制；设计分布感知损失函数，使用闭式KL散度目标最小化傅里叶域信息差异；增强基于VGG的感知损失，在提取的深度特征中嵌入KL散度。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过创新的分布感知损失和增强的感知损失机制，能够更鲁棒地对齐傅里叶域信息，在频率感知增强任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfake technology poses significant
challenges to digital security and authenticity. Detecting these forgeries,
especially across a wide spectrum of manipulation techniques, requires robust
and generalized models. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Deep Fusion
Framework (HDFF), an ensemble-based deep learning architecture designed for

diverse pre-trained sub-models, Swin-MLP, CoAtNet, EfficientNetV2, and DaViT,
which are meticulously fine-tuned through a multi-stage process on the
MultiFFDI dataset. By concatenating the feature representations from these
specialized models and training a final classifier layer, HDFF effectively
leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of
0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position
out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex
image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出弱监督和自监督的类无关运动预测方法，利用前景/背景或非地面/地面掩码替代运动标注，显著减少标注成本，性能优于现有自监督方法，甚至媲美部分监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要理解动态环境中的运动，但获取运动标注成本高昂。室外场景通常包含移动前景和静态背景，因此可以通过场景解析来关联运动理解，从而减少对运动标注的依赖。

Method: 1) 弱监督范式：用全标注或部分标注(1%, 0.1%)的前景/背景掩码替代运动标注；2) 利用非地面/地面掩码进一步减少标注需求(0.01%)；3) 无标注的自监督方法；4) 设计鲁棒一致性感知Chamfer距离损失，整合多帧信息并抑制异常值。

Result: 弱监督和自监督模型优于现有自监督方法，弱监督模型甚至可与某些监督方法相媲美，在标注成本和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 通过利用场景解析线索（前景/背景或非地面/地面分割）来指导运动预测，可以显著减少标注需求，同时保持竞争性的性能表现，为自动驾驶运动预测提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有停车位检测数据集规模有限，缺乏真实世界噪声干扰，且人工标注成本高、易出错，需要构建更大规模数据集并开发半监督方法来利用未标注数据

Method: 构建CRPS-D数据集（包含各种光照、天气条件和挑战性停车位变体），开发基于教师-学生模型的SS-PSD半监督方法，采用置信度引导掩码一致性和自适应特征扰动

Result: SS-PSD在提出的数据集和现有数据集上均优于现有最优方法，未标注数据越多性能提升越显著

Conclusion: CRPS-D是目前最大规模的停车位检测数据集，SS-PSD是首个半监督停车位检测方法，有效解决了数据标注成本高和真实场景噪声问题

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

Motivation: 现有4D雷达超分辨率方法存在训练成本高、推理延迟大、泛化能力差的问题，难以平衡精度和效率

Method: 提出两阶段蒸馏框架：第一阶段进行重建引导的特征蒸馏，第二阶段采用扩散引导的特征蒸馏，并引入噪声适配器自适应对齐噪声水平

Result: 在VoD和内部数据集上的实验表明，MSDNet实现了高保真重建和低延迟推理，并持续提升下游任务性能

Conclusion: MSDNet有效解决了4D雷达点云超分辨率中精度与效率的平衡问题，为自动驾驶感知提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show
TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness

Result: 大量实验证实了该框架的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架为推进视频语言模型发展提供了一个有前景的方向

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Conclusion: LLMs能够以极低成本（50k CT图像-报告对仅需约3美元）实现大规模监督预训练，使医学AI系统更加高效和可扩展

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

Conclusion: CMTSSL在轻量级架构的通用表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，特别适合星上卫星部署的实际高光谱应用

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该视觉质量控制系统能够以最少的数据需求显著提升真空热成型零件的质量一致性

Abstract: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due
to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research
introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise
process parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data
requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from
vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by
image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour
algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process
parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The
model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time,
and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出ResidualViT架构，通过可学习残差连接和token减少模块，在保持精度的同时显著降低视频时序密集任务的计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解任务需要高时间分辨率下的时序密集推理，但计算帧级特征的计算成本很高，需要降低计算开销

Method: 引入ResidualViT架构，包含可学习残差连接确保时序一致性，以及token减少模块选择性丢弃冗余信息并重用预训练基础模型权重；提出轻量级蒸馏策略近似原始基础模型的帧级特征

Result: 在4个任务5个数据集上验证，计算成本降低达60%，推理速度提升2.5倍，同时精度接近原始基础模型

Conclusion: ResidualViT架构能有效降低视频时序密集任务的计算成本，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

TL;DR: RadGame是一个AI驱动的游戏化放射学教育平台，通过定位异常和生成报告两个核心游戏模块，结合大规模公共数据集和AI自动反馈，显著提升放射学培训效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射学培训主要依赖被动案例学习或需要放射科医生实时指导，缺乏即时、可扩展的反馈机制。RadGame旨在通过AI驱动的游戏化平台解决这一痛点。

Method: 平台包含两个核心模块：RadGame Localize（玩家绘制异常边界框，与放射科医生标注对比，视觉语言模型生成错漏可视化解释）和RadGame Report（玩家撰写报告，基于放射学报告生成指标获得结构化AI反馈）。

Result: 前瞻性评估显示，使用RadGame的参与者在定位准确率上提升68%（传统方法仅17%），报告撰写准确率提升31%（传统方法仅4%）。

Conclusion: RadGame展示了AI驱动游戏化在提供可扩展、反馈丰富的放射学培训方面的潜力，重新构想了医疗AI资源在教育中的应用方式。

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

Motivation: 需要可靠的方法来量化AI生成图像的感知真实性并识别视觉不一致区域，这对于AI生成图像的实际应用以及通过训练过程中的真实性反馈来提高生成AI的照片真实感至关重要。

Method: 使用在大规模数据集上训练的视觉语言模型生成视觉不一致性的文本描述，作为人工标注的可靠替代，构建多模态框架同时实现整体客观真实性评估和局部不一致性识别。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了对AI生成图像的整体真实度评估和局部不一致性识别，为生成AI的改进提供了有效的真实性反馈机制。

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated
images and identifying visually inconsistent regions is crucial for practical
use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via
realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

TL;DR: StyleSculptor是一个无需训练的零样本方法，通过内容图像和风格图像生成风格可控的3D资产，使用新颖的风格解耦注意力模块实现纹理和几何风格的精细控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，需要创建与现有资产纹理和几何风格一致的3D资产，但现有的3D生成方法难以实现精细的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn)模块，通过跨3D注意力机制建立内容图像和风格图像的动态交互，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略来分离风格和内容特征通道。

Result: 实验表明StyleSculptor在生成高保真3D资产方面优于现有基线方法，能够实现纹理、几何或两者的精确风格控制。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了零样本的风格引导3D生成，提供了灵活的纹理和几何风格控制能力，为3D内容创作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

TL;DR: SR-3D是一个空间区域感知的视觉语言模型，通过共享视觉标记空间连接单视图2D图像和多视图3D数据，支持灵活的区域提示标注，无需繁琐的多帧标注。


<details>

Motivation: 为了解决2D和3D数据之间的表示鸿沟，让用户能够通过简单的2D标注（如边界框、分割掩码）来实现3D空间推理，而无需复杂的多帧标注或3D传感器输入。

Method: 通过用3D位置嵌入丰富2D视觉特征，使3D模型能够利用强大的2D先验知识进行跨帧的精确空间推理，即使目标对象不在同一视图中出现。

Result: 在通用2D视觉语言和专用3D空间基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明其在统一2D和3D表示空间方面的有效性，且适用于无3D传感器输入或真实3D标注的野外视频。

Conclusion: SR-3D成功建立了2D和3D之间的桥梁，实现了灵活的区域提示和准确的空间关系推断，为场景理解提供了有效的统一表示框架。

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

Motivation: 尽管生成式AI快速发展，用户仍需通过多轮细化来制作详细提示以生成高质量图像，这个过程繁琐且需要专业知识

Method: 采用多代理框架，包含四个专业代理：使用思维链推理推断隐藏上下文、丰富场景细节、自我评估对齐原始输入、反馈调优整合用户反馈进行迭代优化

Result: 实验结果显示PromptSculptor显著提升输出质量，减少用户满意所需的迭代次数，且模型无关设计可与多种T2I模型无缝集成

Conclusion: 该框架为工业应用铺平道路，实现了提示优化过程的自动化，降低了用户使用门槛

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has democratized access to powerful
tools such as Text-to-Image models. However, to generate high-quality images,
users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and
context-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor,
a novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization
process. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work
collaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive,
refined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework
effectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To
iteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified
prompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user
feedback for further refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that
PromptSculptor significantly enhances output quality and reduces the number of
iterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover, its model-agnostic design
allows seamless integration with various T2I models, paving the way for
industrial applications.

TL;DR: 本文在蛋糕分割问题中提出了k-比例性概念，构建了从比例分割到无嫉妒分割的连续尺度，揭示了公平分割中困难点的位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决比例分割和无嫉妒分割之间的差距问题，理解公平分割中困难的具体位置，建立两者之间的连续过渡尺度。

Method: 引入k-比例性概念：当k=n时对应比例分割，k=2时对应无嫉妒分割。通过数学证明分析不同k值下的分割可能性。

Result: 证明当k≤n-1时，存在无法实现k-比例且公平的连通分割的情况；当k≤n-1时，不存在帕累托最优的k-比例连通分割。这些结果将原本仅适用于无嫉妒分割(k=2)的不可能性定理推广到更一般的k值。

Conclusion: k-比例性概念成功构建了比例分割与无嫉妒分割之间的连续尺度，揭示了公平分割困难的具体位置，并为强无嫉妒和强比例分割定理提供了统一的推广框架。

Abstract: This article deals with the cake cutting problem. In this setting, there
exists two notions of fair division: proportional division (when there are n
players, each player thinks to get at least 1/n of the cake) and envy-free
division (each player wants to keep his or her share because he or she does not
envy the portion given to another player). Some results are valid for
proportional division but not for envy-free division. Here, we introduce and
study a scale between the proportional division and the envy-free division. The
goal is to understand where is the gap between statements about proportional
division and envy-free division. This scale comes from the notion introduced in
this article: k-proportionality. When k = n this notion corresponds to the
proportional division and when k = 2 it corresponds to envy-free division. With
k-proportionality we can understand where some difficulties in fair division
lie. First, we show that there are situations in which there is no
k-proportional and equitable division of a pie with connected pieces when k
$\le$ n -1. This result was known only for envy-free division, ie k = 2. Next,
we prove that there are situations in which there is no Pareto-optimal
k-proportional division of a cake with connected pieces when k $\le$ n -1. This
result was known only for k = 2. These theorems say that we can get an
impossibility result even if we do not consider an envy-free division but a
weaker notion. Finally, k-proportionality allows to give a generalization with
a uniform statement of theorems about strong envy-free and strong proportional
divisions.

Conclusion: 提出的二进制八叉树方法能够有效解决无界场景中长距离相机轨迹的网格提取问题，实现时间相干的网格生成，避免视觉伪影。

Abstract: The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation
for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often
necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with
long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique
challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the
geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large.
Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but
this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a
temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera
trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key
idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure
called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline
methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

Abstract: Lattice field theory (LFT) simulations underpin advances in classical
statistical mechanics and quantum field theory, providing a unified
computational framework across particle, nuclear, and condensed matter physics.
However, the application of these methods to high-dimensional systems remains
severely constrained by several challenges, including the prohibitive
computational cost and limited parallelizability of conventional sampling
algorithms such as hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), the substantial training expense
associated with traditional normalizing flow models, and the inherent energy
inefficiency of digital hardware architectures. Here, we introduce a
software-hardware co-design that integrates an adaptive normalizing flow (ANF)
model with a resistive memory-based neural differential equation solver,
enabling efficient generation of LFT configurations. Software-wise, ANF enables
efficient parallel generation of statistically independent configurations,
thereby reducing computational costs, while low-rank adaptation (LoRA) allows
cost-effective fine-tuning across diverse simulation parameters. Hardware-wise,
in-memory computing with resistive memory substantially enhances both
parallelism and energy efficiency. We validate our approach on the scalar phi4
theory and the effective field theory of graphene wires, using a hybrid
analog-digital neural differential equation solver equipped with a 180 nm
resistive memory in-memory computing macro. Our co-design enables low-cost
computation, achieving approximately 8.2-fold and 13.9-fold reductions in
integrated autocorrelation time over HMC, while requiring fine-tuning of less
than 8% of the weights via LoRA. Compared to state-of-the-art GPUs, our
co-design achieves up to approximately 16.1- and 17.0-fold speedups for the two
tasks, as well as 73.7- and 138.0-fold improvements in energy efficiency.

Conclusion: 词关联知识显著加速有意义序列学习并提高系统鲁棒性，验证了语义背景在学习中的重要作用

Abstract: Learning meaningful sentences is different from learning a random set of
words. When humans understand the meaning, the learning occurs relatively
quickly. What mechanisms enable this to happen? In this paper, we examine the
learning of novel sequences in familiar situations. We embed the Small World of
Words (SWOW-EN), a Word Association Norms (WAN) dataset, in a spiking neural
network based on the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) model to simulate
long-term memory. Results show that in the presence of SWOW-EN, there is a
clear difference in speed between the learning of meaningful sentences and
random noise. For example, short poems are learned much faster than sequences
of random words. In addition, the system initialized with SWOW-EN weights shows
greater tolerance to noise.

Furthermore, AwesomeDE is shown to generalize well across distinct problem

Result: AI技术显著提高了在线身份犯罪的速度和规模，同时催生了新的检测和预防方法；目前AI正在推动犯罪分子与执法部门之间的技术军备竞赛，普通用户往往处于被动地位。

Conclusion: 数字时代的身份盗窃在AI技术推动下进入新阶段，需要持续关注技术发展对犯罪模式和防范手段的影响，未来研究应关注这一领域的演进趋势和应对策略。

Abstract: This chapter examines identity theft in the digital age, particularly in the
context of emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It begins with a
discussion of big data and selfhood, the concepts of data selves and data
doubles, and the process of identification in the digital age. Next, the
literature on online identity theft is reviewed, including its theoretical and
empirical aspects. As is evident from that review, AI technologies have
increased the speed and scale of identity crimes that were already rampant in
the online world, even while they have led to new ways of detecting and
preventing such crimes. As with any new technology, AI is currently fuelling an
arms race between criminals and law enforcement, with end users often caught
powerless in the middle. The chapter closes by exploring some emerging
directions and future possibilities of identity theft in the age of AI.

high-level schemas to uncover alternative ideas, (2) risk analysis with
mitigation suggestions, and (3) steering system-generated suggestions. Users
can invoke these supports at any moment, allowing seamless back-and-forth

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习特征映射的新方法，利用以个体注视为中心的时空管道检测联合视觉注意力(JVA)，发现协作任务中JVA更高(44-46%)，独立任务中较低(4-5%)，并通过环境-焦点注意力系数K分析注意力特性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用普及的自我中心眼动仪和大规模日常交互数据集，在多用户环境中识别联合视觉注意力，为理解社交互动中的人类行为提供信息线索

Method: 使用以个体注视为中心的时空管道，通过深度学习特征映射来检测联合视觉注意力，并采用环境-焦点注意力系数K分析注意力特性

Result: 对象聚焦的协作任务产生更高的联合视觉注意力(44-46%)，而独立任务产生较低的注意力(4-5%)；K系数在参与者与共享对象互动时收敛，在独立时发散

Conclusion: 该研究为使用商品化自我中心眼动仪研究联合注意力提供了开创性发现，表明该方法在心理学、人机交互和社交机器人学中具有潜在应用价值，特别是在生态有效环境中理解注意力协调机制

Abstract: Joint visual attention (JVA) provides informative cues on human behavior
during social interactions. The ubiquity of egocentric eye-trackers and
large-scale datasets on everyday interactions offer research opportunities in
identifying JVA in multi-user environments. We propose a novel approach
utilizing spatiotemporal tubes centered on attention rendered by individual
gaze and detect JVA using deep-learning-based feature mapping. Our results
reveal object-focused collaborative tasks to yield higher JVA (44-46%), whereas
independent tasks yield lower (4-5%) attention. Beyond JVA, we analyze
attention characteristics using ambient-focal attention coefficient K to
understand the qualitative aspects of shared attention. Our analysis reveals
$\mathcal{K}$ to converge instances where participants interact with shared
objects while diverging when independent. While our study presents seminal
findings on joint attention with egocentric commodity eye trackers, it
indicates the potential utility of our approach in psychology, human-computer
interaction, and social robotics, particularly in understanding attention
coordination mechanisms in ecologically valid contexts.

*Shomik Jain,Charlotte Park,Matheus Mesquita Viana,Ashia Wilson,Dana Calacci*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨长上下文交互是否导致AI镜像行为，包括迎合性和视角模仿，发现长上下文会增加AI的迎合性，而视角模仿只在AI能准确推断用户视角时增强


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查用户与大型语言模型的长上下文交互是否会引发AI镜像行为，特别是迎合性（过度同意用户）和视角模仿（反映用户观点）

Method: 使用38名用户两周的交互上下文数据，在政治解释和个人建议两个任务上比较有无长上下文时的模型响应

Result: 长上下文会增强AI镜像行为：迎合性在所有交互主题中都增加；视角模仿只在模型能准确推断用户视角的上下文中增加

Conclusion: 真实世界的长上下文交互确实会放大AI镜像行为，但不同镜像行为的表现条件不同，这对AI系统的设计和部署具有重要启示

Abstract: We investigate whether long-context interactions between users and LLMs lead
to AI mirroring behaviors. We focus on two forms of mirroring: (1) sycophancy
-- the tendency of models to be overly agreeable with users, and (2)
perspective mimesis -- the extent to which models reflect a user's perspective.
Using two weeks of interaction context collected from 38 users, we compare
model responses with and without long-context for two tasks: political
explanations and personal advice. Our results demonstrate how and when
real-world interaction contexts can amplify AI mirroring behaviors. We find
that sycophancy increases in long-context, irrespective of the interaction
topics. Perspective mimesis increases only in contexts where models can
accurately infer user perspectives.

TL;DR: 研究发现用户生成头像能增强人机互动中的亲密感，而自适应语言风格匹配反而降低满意度和个性化感知，出现"适应悖论"现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成式AI伴侣聊天机器人中建立真正连接的原理，比较用户可见创作与隐蔽语言风格模仿两种途径的效果

Method: 采用3x2预注册实验设计（N=162），操纵用户控制头像生成（无、预制、用户生成）和语言风格匹配（静态vs自适应）两个变量

Result: 生成头像显著提升亲密感（ω²=0.040, p=0.013），自适应LSM在个性化和满意度上表现不如静态风格（d=0.35, p=0.009），且被评判为适应性更差

Conclusion: 提出稳定性和可读性解释：可见创作促进自然互动，隐蔽模仿可能导致不一致性。设计应优先考虑清晰、用户驱动的个性化，限制风格转换而非依赖不透明的模仿

Abstract: Generative AI powers a growing wave of companion chatbots, yet principles for
fostering genuine connection remain unsettled. We test two routes: visible user
authorship versus covert language-style mimicry. In a preregistered 3x2
experiment (N = 162), we manipulated user-controlled avatar generation (none,
premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs.
adaptive). Generating an avatar boosted rapport ($\omega^2$ = .040, p = .013),
whereas adaptive LSM underperformed static style on personalization and
satisfaction (d = 0.35, p = .009) and was paradoxically judged less adaptive (t
= 3.07, p = .003, d = 0.48). We term this an Adaptation Paradox: synchrony
erodes connection when perceived as incoherent, destabilizing persona. To
explain, we propose a stability-and-legibility account: visible authorship
fosters natural interaction, while covert mimicry risks incoherence. Our
findings suggest designers should prioritize legible, user-driven
personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry.

*Shuning Zhang,Sixing Tao,Eve He,Yuting Yang,Ying Ma,Ailei Wang,Xin Yi,Hewu Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Conflect是一个基于反思思维框架的交互式上下文隐私政策系统，通过侧边栏警报帮助用户在移动应用中理解隐私风险，提高用户理解和信任


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐私政策冗长复杂导致用户忽视，而现有的上下文隐私政策(CPPs)缺乏用户参与度且可能干扰任务完成

Method: 通过三个工作坊构建反思思维设计空间，开发Conflect系统：上下文检测隐私风险、提取政策片段、自动生成风险描述，并在CPP4APP数据集上测试

Result: 系统达到94.0%的政策提取准确率和4.35秒延迟，用户研究(N=28)显示Conflect在用户理解、信任和满意度方面优于CPPs、隐私政策和隐私标签，同时降低认知负荷

Conclusion: Conflect通过反思思维框架有效解决了上下文与行动之间的脱节问题，为用户提供了更好的隐私风险理解和控制能力

Abstract: Privacy policies are lengthy and complex, leading to user neglect. While
contextual privacy policies (CPPs) present information at the point of risk,
they may lack engagement and disrupt tasks. We propose Conflect, an interactive
CPP for mobile apps, guided by a reflective thinking framework. Through three
workshops with experienced designers and researchers, we constructed the design
space of reflective thinking-based CPP design, and identified the disconnect
between context and action as the most critical problem. Based on participants'
feedback, we designed Conflect to use sidebar alerts, allowing users to reflect
on contextualized risks and fostering their control. Our system contextually
detects privacy risks, extracts policy segments, and automatically generates
risk descriptions with 94.0% policy extraction accuracy on CPP4APP dataset and
a 4.35s latency. A user study (N=28) demonstrated that Conflect improves user
understanding, trust, and satisfaction while lowering cognitive load compared
to CPPs, privacy policies and privacy labels.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了非差分隐私专家如何利用LLM实现差分隐私程序，开发了DPCheatSheet工具帮助新手通过工作示例和错误示例学习使用LLM生成正确的DP代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非专业程序员在利用LLM实现差分隐私时面临困难，无法准确表达需求且缺乏验证生成代码正确性的能力，需要专门工具来帮助他们有效使用LLM。

Method: 首先进行需求调研，然后开发DPCheatSheet工具，结合专家工作流程的工作示例和常见错误的错误示例，通过错误识别研究和开放式实现研究验证工具效果。

Result: DPCheatSheet工具被证明能有效帮助新手识别错误并正确实现差分隐私程序，专家只需少量提示就能实现正确的DP分析。

Conclusion: DPCheatSheet通过结合工作示例和错误示例的教学方法，成功帮助非专业程序员利用LLM实现差分隐私，为解决类似领域的学习挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This paper explores how programmers without specialized expertise in
differential privacy (DP) (i.e., novices) can leverage LLMs to implement DP
programs with minimal training. We first conducted a need-finding study with 6
novices and 3 experts to understand how they utilize LLMs in DP implementation.
While DP experts can implement correct DP analyses through a few prompts,
novices struggle to articulate their requirements in prompts and lack the
skills to verify the correctness of the generated code. We then developed
DPCheatSheet, an instructional tool that helps novices implement DP using LLMs.
DPCheatSheet combines two learning concepts: it annotates an expert's workflow
with LLMs as a worked example to bridge the expert mindset to novices, and it
presents five common mistakes in LLM-based DP code generation as erroneous
examples to support error-driven learning. We demonstrated the effectiveness of
DPCheatSheet with an error identification study and an open-ended DP
implementation study.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DoubleAgents是一个代理规划工具，通过用户干预、价值反映策略、状态可视化和不确定性标记来提高透明度和控制力，帮助用户在模拟环境中建立对AI系统的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理工作流虽然承诺效率，但实际采用取决于人们是否信任代表他们行动的系统。需要设计能够嵌入透明度和控制的工具来建立用户信任。

Method: 开发DoubleAgents工具，包含用户干预机制、价值反映策略、丰富的状态可视化、不确定性标记功能，并内置响应者模拟生成真实场景供用户演练。通过实验室研究（n=10）、两个实际部署（n=2）和技术评估进行验证。

Result: 参与者最初对委托持犹豫态度，但在模拟案例中体验了透明度、控制和自适应学习后变得更加依赖。部署结果显示工具在现实世界中的相关性和实用性，所需工作量与任务复杂性和上下文数据相适应。

Conclusion: 提出了信任设计模式和主动AI机制——一致性、可控性和可解释性，以及模拟作为随时间建立和校准信任的安全路径。

Abstract: Agentic workflows promise efficiency, but adoption hinges on whether people
actually trust systems that act on their behalf. We present DoubleAgents, an
agentic planning tool that embeds transparency and control through user
intervention, value-reflecting policies, rich state visualizations, and
uncertainty flagging for human coordination tasks. A built-in respondent
simulation generates realistic scenarios, allowing users to rehearse, refine
policies, and calibrate their reliance before live use. We evaluate
DoubleAgents in a two-day lab study (n=10), two deployments (n=2), and a
technical evaluation. Results show that participants initially hesitated to
delegate but grew more reliant as they experienced transparency, control, and
adaptive learning during simulated cases. Deployment results demonstrate
DoubleAgents' real-world relevance and usefulness, showing that the effort
required scaled appropriately with task complexity and contextual data. We
contribute trust-by-design patterns and mechanisms for proactive AI --
consistency, controllability, and explainability -- along with simulation as a
safe path to build and calibrate trust over time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半结构化访谈的质量很大程度上取决于后续问题的质量，但访谈者的知识和技能可能限制问题的深度。虽然LLMs在定性分析中已被证明有用，但在数据收集过程中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用AI驱动的"Wizard-of-Oz"实验设置，通过17名参与者的研究，考察实时LLM支持生成后续问题如何影响半结构化访谈，分析人机角色分工、关系和协作行为。

Result: 研究结果提供了AI生成后续问题优势和局限性的实证证据，提出了该访谈情境下的人机协作框架，并提出了以人为中心的AI辅助访谈设计指南。

Conclusion: LLMs应作为人类判断的补充而非替代，研究强调了将AI整合到定性数据收集中的可行路径。

Abstract: Semi-structured interviews highly rely on the quality of follow-up questions,
yet interviewers' knowledge and skills may limit their depth and potentially
affect outcomes. While many studies have shown the usefulness of large language
models (LLMs) for qualitative analysis, their possibility in the data
collection process remains underexplored. We adopt an AI-driven "Wizard-of-Oz"
setup to investigate how real-time LLM support in generating follow-up
questions shapes semi-structured interviews. Through a study with 17
participants, we examine the value of LLM-generated follow-up questions, the
evolving division of roles, relationships, collaborative behaviors, and
responsibilities between interviewers and AI. Our findings (1) provide
empirical evidence of the strengths and limitations of AI-generated follow-up
questions (AGQs); (2) introduce a Human-AI collaboration framework in this
interview context; and (3) propose human-centered design guidelines for
AI-assisted interviewing. We position LLMs as complements, not replacements, to
human judgment, and highlight pathways for integrating AI into qualitative data
collection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型存在不透明、集中化和过度通用化的问题，算法自动化威胁人类代理和民主价值，需要寻找应对方案。

Method: 借鉴1970年代斯堪的纳维亚参与式设计传统，提出参与式AI方法，应用五个参与式设计原则解决四个算法自动化设计挑战，并通过具体案例研究说明。

Result: 展示了如何将AI模型从专有产品转变为共享的社会技术系统，增强而非削弱人类代理、尊严和价值观。

Conclusion: 参与式AI为构建更加民主、以人为本的AI系统提供了可行路径，能够有效应对算法自动化带来的挑战。

Abstract: AI's transformative impact on work, education, and everyday life makes it as
much a political artifact as a technological one. Current AI models are opaque,
centralized, and overly generic. The algorithmic automation they provide
threatens human agency and democratic values in both workplaces and daily life.
To confront such challenges, we turn to Scandinavian Participatory Design (PD),
which was devised in the 1970s to face a similar threat from mechanical
automation. In the PD tradition, technology is seen not just as an artifact,
but as a locus of democracy. Drawing from this tradition, we propose
Participatory AI as a PD approach to human-centered AI that applies five PD
principles to four design challenges for algorithmic automation. We use
concrete case studies to illustrate how to treat AI models less as proprietary
products and more as shared socio-technical systems that enhance rather than
diminish human agency, human dignity, and human values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数据使用中公共价值评估的缺失，让多元利益相关者能够批判性地参与数据项目，促进负责任的决策和共享问责制。

Method: 基于数据团结理论，开发结构化评估框架，将定性的风险和收益评估转化为可操作的量化指标，同时保持包容性和透明度。

Result: 初步用户反馈显示PLUTO具有促进负责任决策和共享问责的潜力，但在定性到定量指标转化方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: PLUTO框架为数据使用的公共价值评估提供了有效工具，有助于建立更加负责任和透明的数据实践，但需要进一步解决定性评估量化的问题。

Abstract: We present PLUTO (Public VaLUe Assessment TOol), a framework for assessing
the public value of specific instances of data use. Grounded in the concept of
data solidarity, PLUTO aims to empower diverse stakeholders - including
regulatory bodies, private enterprises, NGOs, and individuals - to critically
engage with data projects through a structured assessment of the risks and
benefits of data use, and by encouraging critical reflection. This paper
discusses the theoretical foundation, development process, and initial user
experiences with PLUTO. Key challenges include translating qualitative
assessments of benefits and risks into actionable quantitative metrics while
maintaining inclusivity and transparency. Initial feedback highlights PLUTO's
potential to foster responsible decision-making and shared accountability in
data practices.

TL;DR: 自动化通过影响个体能动性感知来改变风险承担行为，自动化水平越高或可靠性越低，风险承担意愿越低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究对自动化影响风险承担的内在机制关注不足，需要探究自动化水平和可靠性如何通过能动性感知影响风险决策

Method: 通过三个实验量化能动性感知的主观评分，研究自动化水平和可靠性水平对风险承担的影响

Result: 自动化降低风险承担水平；高自动化水平导致低能动性感知和低风险承担，能动性感知起完全中介作用；高自动化可靠性导致高能动性感知和高风险承担，能动性感知起部分中介作用

Conclusion: 自动化通过影响能动性感知来改变风险承担行为，自动化水平和可靠性对风险承担具有不同的影响机制

Abstract: Automation significantly alters human behavior, particularly risk-taking.
Previous researches have paid limited attention to the underlying
characteristics of automation and their mechanisms of influence on risk-taking.
This study investigated how automation affects risk-taking and examined the
role of sense of agency therein. By quantifying sense of agency through
subjective ratings, this research explored the impact of automation level and
reliability level on risk-taking. The results of three experiments indicated
that automation reduced the level of risk-taking; higher automation level was
associated with lower sense of agency and lower risk-taking, with sense of
agency playing a complete mediating role; higher automation reliability was
associated with higher sense of agency and higher risk-taking, with sense of
agency playing a partial mediating role. The study concludes that automation
influences risk-taking, such that higher automation level or lower reliability
is associated with a lower likelihood of risk-taking. Sense of agency mediates
the impact of automation on risk-taking, and automation level and reliability
have different effects on risk-taking.

Motivation: 虚拟化身使用AI生成手势来增强真实感，但现有评估主要局限于2D环境。VR提供了沉浸式替代方案，可能影响手势的感知方式。

Method: 比较评估VR和2D环境中的计算机生成手势，使用2023 GENEA挑战赛中的三个模型进行测试。

Result: VR环境中的手势平均评分略高，对动作捕捉的真实运动效果影响最显著。模型排名在不同设置中保持一致，但VR影响了参与者的整体感知。

Conclusion: VR为手势评估提供了超越传统2D方法的独特优势，虽然模型表现相对一致，但沉浸式环境改变了用户的感知体验。

Abstract: Gestures are central to human communication, enriching interactions through
non-verbal expression. Virtual avatars increasingly use AI-generated gestures
to enhance life-likeness, yet evaluations have largely been confined to 2D.
Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive alternative that may affect how
gestures are perceived. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
computer-generated gestures in VR and 2D, examining three models from the 2023
GENEA Challenge. Results show that gestures viewed in VR were rated slightly
higher on average, with the strongest effect observed for motion-capture "true
movement." While model rankings remained consistent across settings, VR
influenced participants' overall perception and offered unique benefits over
traditional 2D evaluation.

TL;DR: 本研究通过混合方法分析用户如何评估包含多个敏感对象的图像隐私，发现细粒度细节（如拍摄背景和对象共现）显著影响隐私感知，为社交媒体提供个性化隐私保护设计的新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上每天有数十亿张照片被分享，但照片往往通过可见和上下文线索揭示比预期更多的信息，带来隐私风险。以往研究通常将隐私视为整个图像的属性，忽略了单个对象可能携带不同隐私风险并影响用户感知。

Method: 采用混合方法研究（n=92），了解用户如何评估包含多个敏感对象的图像隐私，分析心理模型和细微模式。

Result: 研究结果揭示了心理模型和细微模式，发现照片拍摄背景和其他对象的共现等细粒度细节会影响隐私感知。

Conclusion: 这些新颖的见解可以为社交媒体和未来技术实现个性化、情境感知的隐私保护设计提供支持。

Abstract: User-generated content, such as photos, comprises the majority of online
media content and drives engagement due to the human ability to process visual
information quickly. Consequently, many online platforms are designed for
sharing visual content, with billions of photos posted daily. However, photos
often reveal more than they intended through visible and contextual cues,
leading to privacy risks. Previous studies typically treat privacy as a
property of the entire image, overlooking individual objects that may carry
varying privacy risks and influence how users perceive it. We address this gap
with a mixed-methods study (n = 92) to understand how users evaluate the
privacy of images containing multiple sensitive objects. Our results reveal
mental models and nuanced patterns that uncover how granular details, such as
photo-capturing context and co-presence of other objects, affect privacy
perceptions. These novel insights could enable personalized, context-aware
privacy protection designs on social media and future technologies.

Motivation: 虽然远程监测在支持临床决策方面的价值已得到认可，但患者对其在预康复（特别是结直肠癌手术预康复）中使用的看法仍未得到充分探索，与康复环境相比尤其如此。

Method: 对完成四周结直肠癌预康复计划（包含持续远程监测）的五名患者进行访谈。

Result: 研究发现患者参与远程监测的意愿受到其动机、感知益处和担忧的影响。研究概述了以患者为中心的系统设计考虑。

Conclusion: 研究为结直肠癌预康复中远程监测的进一步研究奠定了基础，并提供了患者视角的重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal prehabilitation for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery aims to
optimize patient fitness and reduce postoperative complications. While
telemonitoring's clinical value in supporting decision-making is recognized,
patient perspectives on its use in prehabilitation remain underexplored,
particularly compared to its related clinical context, rehabilitation. To
address this gap, we conducted interviews with five patients who completed a
four-week CRC prehabilitation program incorporating continuous telemonitoring.
Our findings reveal patients' willingness to engage with telemonitoring, shaped
by their motivations, perceived benefits, and concerns. We outline design
considerations for patient-centered systems and offer a foundation for further
research on telemonitoring in CRC prehabilitation.

scholarly reading and writing, Textarium combines human analysis with
lightweight computational processing to bridge close and distant reading
practices. Readers can highlight text, group keywords into concepts, and embed
these observations as anchors in essays. The interface renders these
interpretive actions as parameterized visualization states. Through a
speculative design process of co-creative and iterative prototyping, we

Method: 对71名高年级计算机科学学生进行调查研究，在即时（1小时）和延长（10天）使用GitHub Copilot后，定量测量信任水平并定性分析信任变化原因。

Result: 学生信任度平均随时间增加，但认识到Copilot需要有能力程序员手动完成某些任务。正确性展示、代码上下文理解能力和NLP基础知识学习是信任提升的主要因素。

Conclusion: 研究为教育者和行业管理者提供了理解学生如何校准AI助手信任的因素，并提出了四项教学建议：提供挑战性任务机会、教授传统技能、教授NLP基础知识、展示Copilot功能范围。

Abstract: Motivation. Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude
that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that
are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or
vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that
can improve their productivity and well-being.
  Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this
study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one
hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data
from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base,
representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study,
we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why
student trust changes.
  Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a
project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent
programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing
Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code
base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to
their elevated trust.
  Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand
the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI
assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS
educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on
challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach
traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can
verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language
processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features
available in Copilot.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个具身组合框架来解决沉浸式计算笔记本中大量单元的组织挑战，通过用户研究发现该框架能显著减少用户努力和完成时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着沉浸式技术的发展，沉浸式计算笔记本为代码、数据和输出的交互提供了新机会，但手动排列大量单元以保持执行逻辑和视觉一致性仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 引入具身组合框架，并通过受控用户研究比较手动和具身组合框架在组织过程中的效果。

Result: 具身组合框架显著减少了用户努力和完成时间，但触发机制的设计需要进一步改进。

Conclusion: 具身组合框架有潜力增强沉浸式计算笔记本中组织过程的可扩展性。

Abstract: As immersive technologies evolve, immersive computational notebooks offer new
opportunities for interacting with code, data, and outputs. However, scaling
these environments remains a challenge, particularly when analysts manually
arrange large numbers of cells to maintain both execution logic and visual
coherence. To address this, we introduce an embodied composition framework,
facilitating organizational processes in the context of immersive computational
notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the embodied composition framework,
we conducted a controlled user study comparing manual and embodied composition
frameworks in an organizational process. The results show that embodied
composition frameworks significantly reduced user effort and decreased
completion time. However, the design of the triggering mechanism requires
further refinement. Our findings highlight the potential of embodied
composition frameworks to enhance the scalability of the organizational process
in immersive computational notebooks.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ICoN是一个在完全沉浸式环境中无缝连接计算笔记本和具身数据探索的原型系统，解决了现有工具分离导致的流程中断问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有沉浸式分析工具要么基于WIMP界面（不适用于复杂数据探索），要么是独立的具身交互系统，分析人员需要在不同环境间切换，导致工作流程中断和效率低下。

Method: 开发了ICoN原型系统，在一个统一的完全沉浸式环境中整合了计算笔记本功能和具身数据探索能力，支持无缝过渡。

Result: 研究发现统一化方法显著提高了分析工作流程中的过渡效率和直观性，证明了无缝数据分析的潜力。

Conclusion: ICoN展示了在沉浸式环境中统一计算笔记本和具身数据探索的价值，为未来沉浸式分析工具的设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: A growing interest in Immersive Analytics (IA) has led to the extension of
computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) into an immersive environment
to enhance analytical workflows. However, existing solutions rely on the WIMP
(windows, icons, menus, pointer) metaphor, which remains impractical for
complex data exploration. Although embodied interaction offers a more intuitive
alternative, immersive computational notebooks and embodied data exploration
systems are implemented as standalone tools. This separation requires analysts
to invest considerable effort to transition from one environment to an entirely
different one during analytical workflows. To address this, we introduce ICoN,
a prototype that facilitates a seamless transition between computational
notebooks and embodied data explorations within a unified, fully immersive
environment. Our findings reveal that unification improves transition
efficiency and intuitiveness during analytical workflows, highlighting its
potential for seamless data analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLSMAC是一个基于三十六计设计的新型多智能体强化学习基准测试，包含12个星际争霸II场景，专注于评估高级战略决策能力，超越了传统微操测试的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL基准测试（如SMAC）主要关注微观操作，缺乏对高级战略智能的全面评估，需要新的测试环境来推动多智能体战略决策能力的发展。

Method: 基于三十六计经典战略设计了12个星际争霸II场景，每个场景对应特定计策，挑战智能体的战术机动、时机协调和欺骗等战略要素，并提出多维度评估指标。

Result: 将最先进的MARL算法和LLM智能体集成到HLSMAC中进行全面实验，证明该基准能够有效测试多智能体战略决策能力。

Conclusion: HLSMAC作为一个强大的测试平台，为推进多智能体战略决策研究提供了有效工具，开启了评估高级战略智能的新途径。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

to assist Vietnamese high school students in preparing for the National High
School Graduation Mathematics Exams (NHSGMEs). The salient framework integrates
three specialized AI agents: a specification-matrix-conditioned question
generator, a solver/explainer for detailed step-by-step reasoning, and a

accuracy, delivers coherent explanations, and enhances the variety of practice
materials. These results highlight its potential to support scalable, equitable
mathematics preparation aligned with national standards while also empowering
teachers through AI-assisted exam creation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DISPLIB——一个用于列车重路由和重调度问题的标准化问题定义和文件格式，旨在解决该领域缺乏公开数据和代码共享的问题，促进算法性能的可比性和研究可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铁路优化决策支持系统通过自动重路由和重调度列车来减少延误，但现有研究通常与特定工业用例紧密绑定，缺乏公开数据和代码共享，导致研究难以复现和算法性能无法公平比较。

Method: 引入通用的DISPLIB问题定义和文件格式，收集多个真实工业用例的问题实例并公开提供，同时提供参考求解器实现。

Result: 建立了标准化的列车调度问题框架，提供了公开可用的真实工业数据集和参考实现，为研究人员提供了无需工业连接即可研究该问题的平台。

Conclusion: DISPLIB框架解决了列车重路由和重调度研究领域的可重复性和可比性问题，为研究社区提供了统一的基准测试平台，类似于MILP、SAT等其他成功的研究社区模式。

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Agentic AI的金融犯罪合规系统，通过自动化流程和可解释性设计，在数字金融平台中实现透明且符合监管要求的合规管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融犯罪合规成本不断上升但效果有限，现有AI解决方案不透明且难以满足监管要求，需要开发既能自动化又能保证透明度和可追溯性的合规系统。

Method: 采用行动设计研究（ADR）方法，与金融科技公司和监管机构合作，通过工件中心建模构建自主代理系统，实现任务特定模型路由和审计日志记录。

Result: 开发了包含参考架构和实际原型的系统，能够自动化处理客户入驻、监控、调查和报告等合规流程，同时确保可解释性和监管合规性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在负责任的治理结构内嵌入自动化AI系统，可以在高风险监管环境中支持透明度和机构信任，为AI驱动的合规管理提供了新的实现路径。

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了InPhyRe基准测试，用于评估大型多模态模型在违反物理规律的场景中的归纳物理推理能力，发现现有模型存在参数知识应用困难、语言偏见和视觉输入忽略等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型仅编码训练时观察到的物理规律作为参数知识，无法处理违反物理规律的推理场景，而人类具备从少量视觉示例中适应新物理环境的归纳推理能力，这对安全关键应用至关重要。

Method: 提出InPhyRe视觉问答基准，通过算法生成的合成碰撞视频评估模型在违反物理规律的碰撞事件中的推理能力，测试了13个大型多模态模型。

Result: 研究发现：(1)模型难以将有限的参数知识应用于推理；(2)当演示样本违反物理规律时，归纳物理推理能力较弱；(3)模型存在语言偏见，很大程度上忽略视觉输入。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在视觉输入的可靠性方面存在严重问题，归纳物理推理能力不足，限制了其在安全关键应用中替代人类的能力。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

*Liangqi Yuan,Dong-Jun Han,Christopher G. Brinton,Sabine Brunswicker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出LLMAP系统，结合LLM解析自然语言偏好和多步图搜索算法，解决多约束条件下的最优路径规划问题，在全球多个城市实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM路径规划存在两大问题：直接使用LLM处理大规模地图数据困难，而基于图搜索的方法对自然语言偏好理解有限。此外，用户时空分布的高度异构性和不可预测性带来了更大挑战。

Method: 采用LLM-as-Parser解析自然语言、识别任务、提取用户偏好和任务依赖关系，结合多步图构建与迭代搜索算法(MSGS)作为底层求解器，通过多目标优化自适应调整权重。

Result: 在14个国家27个城市的1000个不同复杂度路由提示实验中，该方法在多个约束条件下实现了优越性能并具有保证。

Conclusion: LLMAP系统成功解决了自然语言驱动的多约束路径规划问题，在最大化POI质量和任务完成率的同时最小化路径距离，适应了用户时间限制、POI开放时间和任务依赖等关键约束。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Motivation: 温室环境控制和植物状态监测对作物生产管理决策至关重要，需要开发智能化系统来提高管理效率和决策准确性

Method: 开发了基于物联网的平台来监控环境条件，并采用VGG-19、InceptionResNetV2和InceptionV3等AI算法构建疾病检测框架，分析定期捕获的植物图像

Result: 物联网系统能够持续在线发布温度、湿度、水流量等数据并调整控制参数；VGG-19算法在疾病检测中表现最佳，准确率达到92%

Conclusion: 该智能温室系统成功整合了物联网和人工智能技术，能够有效监测植物健康状况和环境条件，为精准农业管理提供了可行的技术解决方案

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

TL;DR: AIssistant是一个开源的、以代理为基础的人机协作框架，旨在简化科学工作流的端到端创建，通过模块化工具和代理实现文献合成、实验、引用管理和LaTeX论文生成，同时保持人工监督以确保准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助研究工具虽然强大但碎片化，缺乏以人为本的工作流程，需要开发一个集成框架来简化科学工作流的创建过程。

Method: 开发AIssistant框架，集成模块化工具和代理进行文献合成、分段实验、引用管理和自动LaTeX文本生成，并在机器学习领域的视角和综述论文中进行初步实验。

Result: 通过三层评估（独立人工评审、自动化LLM评审、程序主席监督）显示，AIssistant提高了起草效率和主题一致性，但人机协作对于保持事实正确性、方法合理性和伦理合规性仍然至关重要。

Conclusion: AIssistant在提高科研效率方面有效，但仍存在引用幻觉、难以适应动态论文结构、多模态内容整合不完全等关键限制，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分解方法，先进行结构化交互摘要，再用微调模型进行意图提取，提升资源受限模型在UI交互意图理解上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型设备端模型在UI交互轨迹意图理解方面的准确性问题，提供隐私保护、低成本和低延迟的用户体验

Method: 两步分解方法：1) 结构化交互摘要，捕获每个用户操作的关键信息；2) 使用微调模型在聚合摘要上进行意图提取

Result: 该方法改善了资源受限模型的意图理解能力，甚至超越了大型多模态大语言模型的基线性能

Conclusion: 分解方法能有效提升小型模型在复杂UI交互意图理解任务上的表现，为设备端智能代理开发提供了可行方案

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

*Jiahao Yu,Zelei Cheng,Xian Wu,Xinyu Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\sys的熵增强框架，用于在多轮工具辅助的代码生成任务中保持输出多样性，通过改进偏好优化算法和混合轨迹选择方案，在SWE-bench基准测试中取得了最先进的结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好优化算法（如DPO和KTO）虽然能有效对齐模型输出与人类偏好，但会降低输出多样性，限制测试时扩展的效果。同时，这些算法主要针对单轮任务设计，无法充分处理多轮推理和工具集成所需的复杂性

Method: \sys框架通过增强偏好目标来显式保持策略熵，并将学习推广到优化多轮交互而非单轮响应。还提出了混合最佳轨迹选择方案，结合学习验证器模型和无模型方法

Result: 在SWE-bench排行榜上，使用\sys训练的30B参数模型在open-weight模型中排名第一（在\lite上）和第四（在\verified上），仅被参数量超过10倍（>350B）的模型超越

Conclusion: \sys框架成功解决了偏好优化中多样性损失的问题，在多轮工具辅助的代码生成任务中实现了显著的性能提升，为软件工程中的复杂多步挑战提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决世界模型在部署时面临的大小与性能之间的权衡问题 - 大模型计算资源需求高难以在边缘设备部署，小模型物理学习能力不足导致预测效果差。

Method: 提出Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM)，使用Soft Mask技术改进动态对象建模和未来预测，并引入Warm Start推理技术来零样本提升预测质量。

Result: 在相同参数量(400M)下，PIWM比基线模型提升60.6%的加权总分；最小的PIWM(130M Soft Mask)相比最大的基线模型(400M)获得7.4%更高的加权总分，且推理速度快28%。

Conclusion: PIWM通过创新的训练和推理技术，成功实现了在紧凑模型规模下获得优异性能的目标，为边缘设备部署高质量世界模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

### [147] [Reasoning Models Can be Accurately Pruned Via Chain-of-Thought Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12464)
*Ryan Lucas,Kayhan Behdin,Zhipeng Wang,Qingquan Song,Shao Tang,Rahul Mazumder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对推理语言模型的压缩方法RAC，通过在剪枝过程中同时重构输入和思维链轨迹，显著提升了压缩后模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM剪枝方法主要关注输入重构，但推理任务是解码主导的，这导致标准压缩技术在推理模型上性能损失更大，甚至可能使模型变慢。

Method: 提出Reasoning-Aware Compression (RAC)方法，在剪枝过程中联合重构输入和模型在策略思维链轨迹的激活值，可与现有剪枝工作流（如SparseGPT）无缝集成。

Result: RAC方法显著提升了压缩后推理模型的性能，解决了标准剪枝方法在推理任务上性能损失大的问题。

Conclusion: RAC是一种简单有效的drop-in修复方案，通过考虑推理任务特性来改进模型压缩，在保持推理能力的同时实现高效部署。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the

Motivation: 临床研究和试验设计中的样本量计算对于功效分析至关重要，但其复杂性和对统计专业知识的依赖给许多研究人员造成了障碍。

Method: 开发了PowerGPT系统，将大语言模型与统计引擎集成，自动化测试选择和样本量估计过程。通过随机试验评估其有效性。

Result: 在随机试验中，PowerGPT显著提高了任务完成率（检验选择99.3% vs 88.9%，样本量计算99.3% vs 77.8%）和准确性（样本量估计94.1% vs 55.4%，p < 0.001），同时减少了平均完成时间（4.0 vs 9.3分钟，p < 0.001）。这些改进在各种统计检验中表现一致，对统计学家和非统计学家都有益。

Conclusion: PowerGPT代表了一种可扩展的AI驱动方法，能够提高临床研究中统计功效分析的可及性、效率和准确性，目前已在多个机构部署使用。

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

Motivation: 研究认知科学和理论计算机科学如何共同分类和解释任务难度，探索智能机制如何通过利用物理约束和认知策略来降低问题复杂度。

Method: 通过分析Soma立方体拼图的分支因子（搜索树出度）来量化任务难度，逐步改进试错搜索方法，包括预处理（认知组块）、值排序（认知自由排序）、变量排序（认知支架）和剪枝（认知推理）。

Result: 研究发现通过分层认知策略可以显著降低搜索复杂度，有效利用物理制品能够通过利用物理约束来降低时间复杂性。

Conclusion: 提出了一个智能模型，将智能视为一个算法库，能够同时调用心智和物质的能力，强调了物质环境在认知问题解决中的重要作用。

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

TL;DR: 本研究通过两步骤可解释工作流分析俄亥俄州环岛事故，识别四种事故模式并用SHAP解释树模型量化伤害驱动因素，发现黑暗、湿滑路面和高速条件下固定物体或角度碰撞更严重，而清晰、低速条件下较轻。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环岛虽能减少严重事故，但风险模式因条件而异，需要可解释的分析方法来理解不同条件下的事故机制和严重性驱动因素。

Method: 使用聚类对应分析(CCA)识别共现因素得到四种事故模式，然后基于树的严重性模型用SHAP解释来量化模式内和跨模式的伤害驱动因素。

Result: 发现黑暗、湿滑路面和较高限速与固定物体或角度碰撞事件同时出现时严重性更高，而在清晰、低速环境下严重性较低。模式特定解释揭示了入口处(未能让行、间隙接受)、多车道循环内(不当操作)和减速时(追尾)的机制。

Conclusion: 该工作流将模式发现与案例级解释联系起来，支持场地筛选、对策选择和审计就绪报告，为公共安全分析提供了实用的可解释人工智能模板。

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

equivalent to a Thurstone model. Based on the zELO method, we use unsupervised
data in order train a suite of state-of-the-art open-weight reranker models:
zerank-1 and zerank-1-small. These models achieve the highest retrieval scores
in multiple domains, including finance, legal, code, and STEM, outperforming
closed-source proprietary rerankers on both NDCG@10 and Recall. These models
also demonstrate great versatility, maintaining their 0-shot performance on
out-of-domain and private customer datasets. The training data included 112,000
queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from
unannotated queries and documents in less than 10,000 H100-hours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统客服系统存在处理时间长、首次解决率低、客户满意度差的问题，主要原因是客服人员认知负荷高，需要手动操作多个系统。现有AI辅助工具多为被动响应，缺乏深层上下文推理能力。

Method: 开发了Minerva CQ系统，采用Agentic AI架构，集成实时转录、意图和情感检测、实体识别、上下文检索、动态客户画像和部分对话摘要等功能，实现主动工作流和持续上下文构建。

Result: 在实际生产环境中部署后，Minerva CQ作为AI副驾驶，在多个部署中显著提升了客服效率和客户体验，取得了可衡量的改进效果。

Conclusion: Agentic AI方法通过目标驱动、自主、使用工具的系统，能够主动实时支持客服人员，相比传统方法在识别客户意图、触发模块化工作流、维护演进上下文和动态适应对话状态方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple
deployments.

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DaSAThco是一个使用大型语言模型生成多样化启发式集成，并通过自适应选择机制实现从实例特征到定制化启发式集成的通用映射框架，解决了SAT求解器配置泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAT问题的异质性使得单一最优配置不可行，而现有的数据集特定方法缺乏泛化能力且需要对新问题类型进行昂贵的重新优化。

Method: 使用大型语言模型在系统定义的问题原型指导下生成专门的启发式集成组合，然后学习自适应选择机制来形成最终的映射关系。

Result: 实验表明DaSAThco实现了优越的性能，特别是在非自适应方法表现有限的领域外泛化方面表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为复杂可配置系统的自动化算法设计建立了更可扩展和实用的路径。

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

TL;DR: AD-FCoT是一种基于类比推理和思维链提示的金融情感分析框架，无需额外训练即可提升LLM在金融新闻情感分类和市场回报预测方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融情感分析方法难以捕捉复杂的经济背景且缺乏透明推理，影响了可靠性。LLM具有强大的文本理解能力，但需要更好的方法来整合金融知识和推理过程。

Method: 提出类比驱动的金融思维链(AD-FCoT)提示框架，通过类比推理将新事件与已知结果的历史场景进行对比，并嵌入结构化的逐步推理链中。

Result: 在数千篇新闻文章上的实验表明，AD-FCoT在情感分类准确性上优于强基线，与市场回报的相关性显著更高，生成的解释与领域专业知识一致。

Conclusion: AD-FCoT通过纯提示方式有效提升了金融情感分析的性能和可解释性，无需额外训练数据或微调，为实际金融分析提供了适用的可解释见解。

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

Motivation: 解决Text2SQL中语法正确但语义误解用户意图的问题，同时发现当前基准评估存在系统性缺陷，需要更严格的数据集管理。

Method: 提出GBV-SQL多智能体框架，采用SQL回译验证机制：使用专门智能体将生成的SQL翻译回自然语言，验证其与原始问题的逻辑一致性。

Result: 在BIRD基准上达到63.23%执行准确率（绝对提升5.8%）；在清理错误样本后的Spider基准上达到96.5%（开发集）和97.6%（测试集）准确率。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了语义验证的鲁棒框架，并揭示了基准数据完整性的重要性，强调了更严格数据集管理的必要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ECG分析方法存在模型特定的ECG编码器阻碍跨LLM迁移、Transformer难以捕捉ECG关键时间尺度信息、以及黑盒性质限制临床应用等问题。

Method: 通过构建ECG语言和自然语言的混合数据集，ECG-aBcDe将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，无需修改架构即可直接微调预训练LLM，实现双向可转换性并提取注意力热图。

Result: 在ROUGE-L和METEOR上达到竞争性性能，BLEU-4指标在数据集内和跨数据集评估中分别提升2.8倍和3.9倍，达到42.58和30.76分。

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe为ECG分析与LLM集成提供了新范式，实验结果证明了该方法的可行性，显著提升了性能指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

Method: 利用结构化LLM推理生成约束松弛策略，通过三元表示方案动态演化算法原理和可执行代码，建立双向（全局-局部）协同进化机制，结合进化算法和蒙特卡洛树搜索

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的非线性组合优化基准测试中验证了AutoCO的一致有效性和优于基线的性能表现

Conclusion: AutoCO通过LLM学习松弛约束的方法革新了非线性组合优化问题的解决方式，实现了系统化的自动约束优化

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

*Nadim Barakat,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多模态大语言模型（GPT-4o和MedGemma）在糖尿病视网膜病变检测中的表现，发现MedGemma在基线评估中表现更优，而GPT-4o在结合MedGemma描述性输出后也能达到高准确率，表明MLLMs可改善DR筛查流程并作为临床AI辅助研究的可扩展模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA批准的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查系统主要提供二元转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制临床信任和实用性。需要确定最有效的输出格式来增强临床医生与AI的协作性能。

Method: 在IDRiD和Messidor-2数据集上测试GPT-4o和MedGemma两个模型，包括：(1)基线评估，(2)使用合成预测模拟AI辅助，(3)实际AI-to-AI协作（GPT-4o整合MedGemma输出）。

Result: MedGemma在基线评估中表现优于GPT-4o（更高的敏感性和AUROC），GPT-4o具有近乎完美的特异性但敏感性低。在协作中，GPT-4o结合MedGemma描述性输出后AUROC可达0.96，即使没有直接图像访问。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型可以改善糖尿病视网膜病变筛查流程，并作为研究不同输出配置下临床AI辅助的可扩展模拟器。开放、轻量级模型如MedGemma在资源有限环境中特别有价值，描述性输出可增强临床工作流程中的可解释性和医生信任。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型随时间推移的推理能力变化，并探索更高效的推理方法以减少计算成本。

Method: 使用PrOntoQA数据集的真假问题测试三个领先模型，采用思维链提示和思维模型，并开发神经符号架构将问题转化为标准化形式后用Z3求解器处理。

Result: 从2023年到2024年性能提升归因于隐藏思维链提示，2024年到2025年思维模型带来显著改进。神经符号方法在保持近乎完美性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的推理能力随时间显著提升，神经符号架构提供了一种计算效率高的替代方案，推理FLOPs的近似计算在实验中准确度在10%以内。

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

TL;DR: GRRAF是一个无需训练的图推理方法，利用检索增强生成(RAG)和LLM代码生成能力，通过生成可执行代码查询图数据库来完成各种图推理任务，在大多数任务上达到100%准确率并能扩展到万节点大图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图推理方法需要大量微调或依赖预定义算法，存在局限性。GRRAF旨在开发一种无需训练、通用且可扩展的图推理解决方案。

Method: 将目标图存储在图形数据库中，提示LLM生成可执行代码查询来检索必要信息，包含错误反馈循环和超时机制确保正确性和效率。

Result: 在GraphInstruct数据集上，大多数图推理任务达到100%准确率（包括环检测、二分图检查、最短路径、最大流），子图匹配性能也很高，能有效扩展到10,000节点的大图，且token成本与图大小无关。

Conclusion: GRRAF提供了一种高效、准确且可扩展的训练无关图推理框架，通过结合RAG和LLM代码生成能力，成功解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将先验经验和知识视为单一整体，导致知识迁移效率低下且粒度粗糙，无法充分利用LLM智能体在多任务场景中的知识迁移潜力。

Method: 提出分层记忆架构，引入分层后见反思机制(H²R)，从过去的智能体-环境交互中提炼可重用的分层知识。在测试时分别检索高级和低级记忆，使LLM智能体能够高效访问和利用任务相关知识。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验结果表明，H²R能够提高泛化能力和决策性能，优于Expel等先前基线方法。

Conclusion: 分层记忆架构和H²R机制能够有效实现细粒度知识迁移，显著提升LLM智能体在多任务场景中的性能表现，为解决现有方法的局限性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

TL;DR: LTA-Thinker是一个潜在思维增强训练框架，通过提高潜在思维分布的方差来优化大语言模型的复杂推理能力，实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Coconut和SoftCoT在连续潜在空间推理中有效，但高质量潜在思维的生成和利用仍是核心瓶颈。基于SoftCoT++理论，更大的潜在思维分布方差能更好地逼近真实分布。

Method: 1) 基于可学习先验构建潜在思维生成架构，提高生成向量的分布方差；2) 引入基于分布的定向优化范式，结合监督微调损失、语义对齐损失（KL散度）和推理焦点损失（对比学习）进行多目标协同训练。

Result: 实验表明LTA-Thinker在各种基线中达到了最先进的性能，表现出更高的性能上限和更好的扩展效果。

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker通过增强潜在思维分布的方差和引入多目标优化策略，有效提升了大语言模型的复杂推理能力，为动态优化推理过程提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Conclusion: 该自动化方法解决了传统人口普查方法的局限性，为城市提供了可扩展的资源管理工具，展示了AI驱动地理空间分析在城市治理中的效率

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven

Motivation: 现有RLHF方法导致参数变化分散且不透明，难以理解模型内化了什么内容，需要更透明的对齐方法

Method: 特征导向强化学习(FSRL)，使用稀疏自编码器提取可解释特征，训练轻量级适配器来调节这些特征

Result: FSRL在偏好优化方面与当前RLHF方法相当，但机制分析发现适配器策略主要提升风格特征而非明确的对齐概念

Conclusion: FSRL提供了可解释模型控制和诊断对齐机制的工具，揭示了偏好优化过程将风格呈现作为质量的代理指标

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要访问模型参数，但对于GPT-4等仅通过API提供的黑盒大语言模型，参数不可用，这给模型融合带来挑战

Method: 基于进化算法的无导数优化框架，包含稀疏性去噪和符号感知缩放两个关键组件，通过API查询进行模型融合

Result: 在多个任务上达到最先进水平，显著优于现有强基线方法

Conclusion: Evo-Merging方法有效解决了黑盒大语言模型融合问题，为仅通过API访问的模型集成提供了可行方案

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

Motivation: 传统持续学习模型面临严重的隐私挑战，统一的差分隐私预算会导致模型效用大幅下降，阻碍在隐私敏感领域的部署

Method: 1. 基于语义敏感度的token级动态差分隐私策略，自适应分配隐私预算；2. 隐私引导的记忆雕刻模块，智能遗忘敏感信息同时保留任务不变的历史知识

Result: 实验表明PeCL在隐私保护和模型效用之间达到优越平衡，在保持先前任务高精度的同时确保强大的隐私保护，优于基线模型

Conclusion: PeCL框架成功解决了持续学习中的隐私挑战，通过动态隐私分配和智能记忆管理，为隐私敏感场景下的持续学习部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)作为自主代理执行复杂任务时，缺乏可靠的长期规划能力，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 开发Planning Copilot聊天机器人，集成多种规划工具，通过Model Context Protocol(MCP)标准连接LLM与外部工具系统，支持语法检查、规划器选择、计划验证和执行模拟等任务。

Result: 实证评估显示Planning Copilot在使用三个开源LLM时，性能远超没有规划工具的相同LLM；与GPT-5的定性比较表明，尽管依赖较小的LLM，Planning Copilot仍显著优于GPT-5。

Conclusion: 专用规划工具可能是使LLM有效执行规划任务的有效方式，MCP协议使得无需领域特定微调即可使用任何支持MCP的LLM。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

Method: 将文本表示为功能块序列，通过转移顺序和位置评估收敛性，分析小说、在线百科全书、研究论文和电影

Result: 不同媒介遵循不同结构原则：小说顺序上遵循反向AKP，维基百科结合AKP和有序模式，学术论文顺序反向AKP但位置嘈杂，电影按类型分化

Conclusion: 成功取决于媒介特定的结构约束，而失败在不同领域呈现不同形态

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

Result: LLMs能够满足某些约束但难以一致满足所有标准；推理模型（如QwQ和GPT-oss）显著优于传统模型；不同提示策略效果差异明显；迭代提示性能呈现非单调性，可能早期达到峰值后显著下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型推理性能和提示策略在具有偏好约束的组合优化问题中的有效性提供了新的视角，强调了匹配问题对LLMs的挑战性以及需要更专门的方法来改进性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于图的冲突集提取算法(G-CSEA)用于检测伪布尔约束模型中的不可行子集，通过构建蕴含图并在冲突时追踪所有相关约束来解决传统方法的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IIS提取方法如Additive Deletion和QuickXplain需要大量可行性检查，而双射线分析在伪布尔模型中可能失效，需要更高效的冲突检测方法

Method: 基于冲突驱动子句学习(CDCL)思想，在约束传播过程中构建蕴含图，检测到冲突时追踪所有决策分支中的相关约束，生成冲突集，可选使用QuickXplain最小化为IIS

Result: 开发了G-CSEA算法，能够有效提取伪布尔约束模型中的冲突集，相比传统方法减少了求解器调用次数

Conclusion: 图基冲突集提取算法为伪布尔约束模型提供了高效的不可行性诊断工具，特别适用于包含复杂调度规则的劳动力排班问题

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向AGI发展，现有记忆系统存在适应性有限、多模态整合不足、无法支持持续学习等问题，需要更鲁棒和类人的记忆系统

Method: 采用场景驱动方法，从代表性认知场景中提取关键功能需求，形成统一设计原则，提出认知分层记忆架构(COLMA)，整合认知场景、记忆过程和存储机制

Result: 提出了COLMA框架，为开发具有终身学习和类人推理能力的AI系统提供了结构化基础

Conclusion: COLMA架构为AGI的实用化发展做出了贡献，提供了支持持续学习和类人推理的记忆系统设计

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

*Vincent Siu,Nathan W. Henry,Nicholas Crispino,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt是一个简单高效的概念向量提取框架，能够从少量数据中分离出特定概念的神经元表示，实现精确的行为干预，同时引发了对模型安全性的新担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法往往产生过于广泛的影响，需要更精确的概念向量来支持针对性干预和更细粒度的LLM行为理解。

Method: 提出RepIt框架，通过数据高效的方式从少量示例中提取特定概念相关的神经元表示，实现精确的激活干预。

Result: 在五个前沿LLM上，RepIt能够选择性抑制特定概念的拒绝行为，同时保持其他安全功能；仅需100-200个神经元和十几个示例就能提取稳健的目标表示。

Conclusion: RepIt展示了针对性干预可以抵消过度泛化问题，为更细粒度的模型行为控制奠定了基础，但也凸显了用有限计算和数据操纵模型的安全隐患。

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

TL;DR: Shapes of cognition是一种新的计算认知建模范式，通过记忆化的知识星座来简化复杂现实，支持模式识别、习惯行动和类比推理等认知过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决语言赋能智能体(LEIAs)在复杂现实环境中的认知建模问题，提出一种能够模拟人类认知简化机制的新范式，使智能体能够像人类一样通过典型性预期、模式识别和最小化认知负荷来处理复杂情境。

Method: 采用基于形状(shapes)的建模方法，构建包含感官、语言、概念、情景和程序知识的记忆化星座，实现典型情况下的高效处理和异常情况下的恢复机制(如即时学习、寻求人类帮助等)。

Result: 开发了具体的认知架构实现，包括明确的目标、假设、建模策略和知识库，能够对广泛现象进行建模，并构建可解释、可扩展且值得信赖的智能体系统。

Conclusion: 基于形状的建模不仅为LEIAs提供了具体的实现框架，其原则还可广泛应用于知识驱动和混合AI领域，为这些领域注入新的活力。

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了几何红队测试(GRT)框架，通过对象几何形变来测试机器人操作策略的鲁棒性，自动生成能导致策略失败的变形形状(CrashShapes)，并通过蓝队测试(微调)提升策略在特定变形上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准机器人操作评估协议通常只在精选的分布内测试集上评估策略性能，无法揭示系统在合理变化下的失败模式，需要一种能系统性测试策略鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 结合基于雅可比场的变形模型和无梯度、模拟器在环的优化策略，自动生成结构有效且用户约束的网格变形，通过任务级策略执行和约束感知的形状探索来发现导致灾难性失败的几何形状。

Result: GRT在插入、关节操作和抓取任务中一致发现能导致策略性能崩溃的变形，将任务成功率从90%降至最低22.5%。通过蓝队测试(微调)可将特定变形上的任务成功率提升最多60个百分点，同时在原始物体上保持性能。

Conclusion: GRT提供了一个通用的对象中心鲁棒性评估框架，能够发现静态基准测试遗漏的脆弱失败模式，生成的CrashShapes可用于有针对性的策略改进，实验结果在真实机器人上得到验证，与仿真结果高度一致。

Abstract: Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy
performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight
into how systems fail under plausible variation. We introduce Geometric
Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through
object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes --
structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger
catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method
integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free,
simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation,
and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse
policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static
benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape
exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured,
object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally
show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as
blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those
shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the
utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we
validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm,
observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as
22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the
corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统在资源受限条件下的编队控制问题，减少不必要的控制更新以节省资源

Method: 设计分布式事件触发编队控制器，依赖智能体间距离测量，控制更新仅在测量误差超过预设阈值时触发

Result: 通过仿真和真实实验验证，事件触发方法显著减少控制努力，同时保持编队性能，优于周期性触发策略

Conclusion: 事件触发控制策略能有效降低资源消耗，在保持系统稳定性的同时提高多智能体编队控制的效率

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of collaborative formation control for
multi-agent systems with limited resources. We consider a team of robots tasked
with achieving a desired formation from arbitrary initial configurations. To
reduce unnecessary control updates and conserve resources, we propose a
distributed event-triggered formation controller that relies on inter-agent
distance measurements. Control updates are triggered only when the measurement
error exceeds a predefined threshold, ensuring system stability. The proposed
controller is validated through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments involving different formations, communication topologies,
scalability tests, and variations in design parameters, while also being
compared against periodic triggering strategies. Results demonstrate that the
event-triggered approach significantly reduces control efforts while preserving
formation performance.

Abstract: It is crucial to efficiently execute instructions such as "Find an apple and
a banana" or "Get ready for a field trip," which require searching for multiple
objects or understanding context-dependent commands. This study addresses the
challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part
of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site
knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it
by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions
into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel
few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from
ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our
experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments,
outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50).
Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile
manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle
instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready
for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment,
sequential planning, and execution.

Motivation: 当前惯性运动捕捉方法需要离线校准各种参数（如段长度、IMU到段坐标系方向等），使得设置过程不便。本文旨在实现实时无标定的运动跟踪。

Method: 采用递归贝叶斯估计方法，同时估计全局IMU角运动和IMU帧中的关节位置，保持最小状态量设计。

Result: 在模拟的三连杆机械臂数据和重新模拟的人类行走数据上测试，算法不仅提供无漂移的相对和绝对方向估计，还能快速稳定地收敛关节位置估计。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了实时无标定的惯性运动跟踪，解决了传统方法需要繁琐离线校准的问题，在多种运动场景下都表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Inertial motion capture is a promising approach for capturing motion outside
the laboratory. However, as one major drawback, most of the current methods
require different quantities to be calibrated or computed offline as part of
the setup process, such as segment lengths, relative orientations between
inertial measurement units (IMUs) and segment coordinate frames (IMU-to-segment
calibrations) or the joint positions in the IMU frames. This renders the setup
process inconvenient. This work contributes to real-time capable
calibration-free inertial tracking of a kinematic chain, i.e. simultaneous
recursive Bayesian estimation of global IMU angular kinematics and joint
positions in the IMU frames, with a minimal state size. Experimental results on
simulated IMU data from a three-link kinematic chain (manipulator study) as
well as re-simulated IMU data from healthy humans walking (lower body study)
show that the calibration-free and lightweight algorithm provides not only
drift-free relative but also drift-free absolute orientation estimates with a
global heading reference for only one IMU as well as robust and fast
convergence of joint position estimates in the different movement scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于螺旋理论的肌腱驱动超冗余机械臂静态力学求解方法，能够同时使用肌腱长度或张力作为输入，实现开环控制，避免了张力测量和状态估计的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统肌腱驱动超冗余机械臂控制需要测量肌腱张力或机械臂姿态，但这些测量往往不准确。为解决这一问题，需要开发一种能够同时使用肌腱长度和张力作为输入的静态力学求解方法。

Method: 开发了基于螺旋理论的肌腱驱动多段超冗余机械臂弹性关节建模方法，提出了前向静态迭代求解算法，该算法可以等效地使用肌腱长度或张力作为输入参数。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在使用传统张力输入时有效，并且在仅使用肌腱长度时同样有效，证实了在静态条件下仅使用运动学输入进行开环控制的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了超冗余系统中张力测量和状态估计的实际问题，为肌腱驱动超冗余机械臂的控制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyper-redundant tendon-driven manipulators offer greater flexibility and
compliance over traditional manipulators. A common way of controlling such
manipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control
parameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is
representative of the real operational conditions. However, when dealing with
manipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a
static force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping
from the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,
measurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust
tendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement
or state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not
always accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables
tension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics.
We develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment,
hyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics
iterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length
or tension as the input. This strategy is experimentally validated using a
traditional tension input first, subsequently showing the efficacy of the
method when exclusively tendon lengths are used. The results confirm the
possibility to perform open-loop control in static conditions using a kinematic
input only, thus bypassing some of the practical problems with tension
measurement and state estimation of hyper-redundant systems.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了微型无人机在受限环境中进行精细3D重建的潜力，这一能力此前仅限于大型平台，为小型无人机应用开辟了新途径

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for
navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in
payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like
high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,
high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100
grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates
a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A
near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model
quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently
capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data
acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline
employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)
approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)
location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this
architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both
single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory
adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight
paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks
the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in
constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger
platforms.

Abstract: Deformable substrates such as sand and mud present significant challenges for
terrestrial robots due to complex robot-terrain interactions. Inspired by
mudskippers, amphibious animals that naturally adjust their tail morphology and
movement jointly to navigate such environments, we investigate how tail design
and control can jointly enhance flipper-driven locomotion on granular media.
Using a bio-inspired robot modeled after the mudskipper, we experimentally
compared locomotion performance between idle and actively oscillating tail
configurations. Tail oscillation increased robot speed by 67% and reduced body
drag by 46%. Shear force measurements revealed that this improvement was
enabled by tail oscillation fluidizing the substrate, thereby reducing
resistance. Additionally, tail morphology strongly influenced the oscillation
strategy: designs with larger horizontal surface areas leveraged the
oscillation-reduced shear resistance more effectively by limiting insertion
depth. Based on these findings, we present a design principle to inform tail
action selection based on substrate strength and tail morphology. Our results
offer new insights into tail design and control for improving robot locomotion
on deformable substrates, with implications for agricultural robotics, search
and rescue, and environmental exploration.

Abstract: One of the main goals of robotics and intelligent agent research is to enable
natural communication with humans in physically situated settings. While recent
work has focused on verbal modes such as language and speech, non-verbal
communication is crucial for flexible interaction. We present a framework for
generating pointing gestures in embodied agents by combining imitation and
reinforcement learning. Using a small motion capture dataset, our method learns
a motor control policy that produces physically valid, naturalistic gestures
with high referential accuracy. We evaluate the approach against supervised
learning and retrieval baselines in both objective metrics and a virtual
reality referential game with human users. Results show that our system
achieves higher naturalness and accuracy than state-of-the-art supervised
models, highlighting the promise of imitation-RL for communicative gesture
generation and its potential application to robots.

*William Ward,Sarah Etter,Jesse Quattrociocchi,Christian Ellis,Adam J. Thorpe,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线自适应方法，结合函数编码器和递归最小二乘法，在几秒内实现零先验知识到安全控制的实时模型适应，提高了地形变化下的导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主机器人在非结构化环境中需要快速适应地形动态变化（如突然转向冰面），传统静态模型和元学习方法无法满足实时适应需求。

Method: 使用函数编码器与递归最小二乘法相结合，将函数编码器系数作为潜在状态，通过流式里程计数据进行在线更新，无需基于梯度的内循环更新。

Result: 在Van der Pol系统、Unity高保真越野导航模拟器和Clearpath Jackal机器人（包括当地溜冰场的挑战性地形）上验证，相比静态和元学习基线，提高了模型精度和下游规划性能，减少了碰撞。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在几秒内实现实时模型适应，适用于动态地形变化场景，显著提升自主机器人的导航安全性和性能。

Abstract: Autonomous robots must go from zero prior knowledge to safe control within
seconds to operate in unstructured environments. Abrupt terrain changes, such
as a sudden transition to ice, create dynamics shifts that can destabilize
planners unless the model adapts in real-time. We present a method for online
adaptation that combines function encoders with recursive least squares,
treating the function encoder coefficients as latent states updated from
streaming odometry. This yields constant-time coefficient estimation without
gradient-based inner-loop updates, enabling adaptation from only a few seconds
of data. We evaluate our approach on a Van der Pol system to highlight
algorithmic behavior, in a Unity simulator for high-fidelity off-road
navigation, and on a Clearpath Jackal robot, including on a challenging terrain
at a local ice rink. Across these settings, our method improves model accuracy
and downstream planning, reducing collisions compared to static and
meta-learning baselines.

### [189] [Pre-trained Visual Representations Generalize Where it Matters in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12531)
*Scott Jones,Liyou Zhou,Sebastian W. Pattinson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在基于模型的强化学习（MBRL）中使用预训练视觉模型（PVMs）的有效性，发现在严重视觉域偏移场景下PVMs表现优于从头训练的基线模型，部分微调能在极端分布偏移下保持最佳平均任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究发现预训练视觉模型在基于模型的强化学习中效果不佳，但该研究旨在重新评估PVMs在MBRL中的有效性，特别是在视觉域偏移下的泛化能力。

Method: 研究在MBRL框架下使用预训练视觉模型，并测试不同微调程度对模型性能的影响，比较PVMs与从头训练基线模型在视觉域偏移场景下的表现。

Result: 在严重视觉域偏移情况下，PVMs表现显著优于基线模型；部分微调的PVMs在极端分布偏移下能保持最高的平均任务性能。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉模型能有效提升视觉策略学习的鲁棒性，为在基于模型的机器人学习应用中更广泛采用PVMs提供了有力证据。

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is
derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and
vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel
visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy
network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent
developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is
more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has
found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness
in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show
that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline
model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying
levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can
maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in
promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence
for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.

TL;DR: 提出了KORR框架，通过Koopman算子理论在潜在空间中建立线性时不变结构，为残差策略学习提供全局动态建模指导，显著提升了长时程精细机器人装配任务的性能和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的残差策略学习方法主要关注局部修正，缺乏对状态演化的全局理解，限制了在未见场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Method: 利用Koopman算子理论在学习的潜在空间中施加线性时不变结构，通过Koopman预测的潜在状态来调节残差修正，实现全局信息指导的稳定动作精炼

Result: 在长时程精细机器人家具装配任务的各种扰动下，KORR相比强基线方法在性能、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面都取得了持续提升

Conclusion: 基于Koopman的建模有潜力将现代学习方法与经典控制理论相结合，为残差策略学习提供更可靠的全局指导

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory.

*Titong Jiang,Xuefeng Jiang,Yuan Ma,Xin Wen,Bailin Li,Kun Zhan,Peng Jia,Yahui Liu,Sheng Sun,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LightVLA是一个用于视觉-语言-动作模型的差异化token剪枝框架，通过自适应剪枝视觉token来减少计算开销，同时提升任务性能，在LIBERO基准测试中实现了59.1%的FLOPs减少和2.9%的成功率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在真实机器人任务中表现出色，但在资源受限平台上部署时，由于对大量视觉token的注意力计算过于繁重，成为性能瓶颈。需要一种既能保持性能又能提高效率的方法。

Method: 使用动态查询评估视觉token重要性，采用Gumbel softmax实现差异化token选择。通过微调学习保留最有信息的视觉token，剪枝对任务执行无贡献的token。无需启发式参数，不引入额外可训练参数。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试的多个任务中，LightVLA优于现有VLA模型和token剪枝方法，FLOPs减少59.1%，延迟降低38.2%，任务成功率提高2.9%。LightVLA*变体也取得了满意性能。

Conclusion: LightVLA是首个将自适应视觉token剪枝应用于VLA任务的工作，从性能驱动角度自发学习剪枝策略，为实现更高效、强大和实用的实时机器人系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

*Zekai Zhang,Weiye Zhu,Hewei Pan,Xiangchen Wang,Rongtao Xu,Xing Sun,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActiveVLN是一个视觉语言导航框架，通过多轮强化学习实现主动探索，相比传统的模仿学习和DAgger方法，在减少数据收集和训练成本的同时，实现了更好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLN方法主要依赖模仿学习和DAgger后训练，存在数据收集和训练成本高的问题。强化学习虽然有潜力，但先前的方法缺乏与环境动态交互，依赖专家轨迹进行奖励塑造，限制了代理发现多样化导航路径的能力。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用少量专家轨迹进行模仿学习初始化代理；第二阶段通过多轮RL迭代预测和执行动作，自动收集多样化轨迹，使用GRPO目标优化多个rollout。引入动态早停策略剪枝长尾或可能失败的轨迹。

Result: ActiveVLN相比IL基线实现了最大的性能提升，性能与最先进方法相当，但使用了更小的模型。在减少数据收集和训练成本的同时取得了优异效果。

Conclusion: ActiveVLN通过主动探索和多轮强化学习有效解决了VLN任务中的限制，为视觉语言导航提供了一种更高效和有效的训练范式。

Abstract: The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow
natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.
Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and
often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While
effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training
costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,
prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend
on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended
active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and
plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose
ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through
multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is
used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively
predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and
optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL
efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail
or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.
Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL
baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training
methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art
approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PerchMobi^3是一个四风扇负压式空地墙三栖机器人，通过推进-吸附功率复用机制实现空中飞行、地面行驶和墙面爬行的无缝集成，无需额外吸附执行器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有设计通常依赖额外的吸附执行器，增加了复杂性、降低了效率并损害了可靠性，需要一种更简洁高效的多模态移动机器人设计方案。

Method: 采用四个涵道风扇同时提供空中推力和负压吸附，与四个主动驱动轮集成，实现功率复用；建立了建模和控制框架，支持地面、墙面和空中域的协调操作。

Result: 通过地面驾驶、负载辅助墙面爬行、空中飞行和跨模式转换等综合实验验证了设计的可行性，展示了在各种运动场景中的强大适应性。

Conclusion: PerchMobi^3为多模态机器人移动性提供了一种新颖的设计范式，为未来自主和应用导向的部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Achieving seamless integration of aerial flight, ground driving, and wall
climbing within a single robotic platform remains a major challenge, as
existing designs often rely on additional adhesion actuators that increase
complexity, reduce efficiency, and compromise reliability. To address these
limitations, we present PerchMobi^3, a quad-fan, negative-pressure,
air-ground-wall robot that implements a propulsion-adhesion power-reuse
mechanism. By repurposing four ducted fans to simultaneously provide aerial
thrust and negative-pressure adhesion, and integrating them with four actively
driven wheels, PerchMobi^3 eliminates dedicated pumps while maintaining a
lightweight and compact design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
quad-fan prototype to demonstrate functional power reuse for multi-modal
locomotion. A modeling and control framework enables coordinated operation
across ground, wall, and aerial domains with fan-assisted transitions. The
feasibility of the design is validated through a comprehensive set of
experiments covering ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial
flight, and cross-mode transitions, demonstrating robust adaptability across
locomotion scenarios. These results highlight the potential of PerchMobi^3 as a
novel design paradigm for multi-modal robotic mobility, paving the way for
future extensions toward autonomous and application-oriented deployment.

Motivation: 现有安全过滤器通常假设完全可观测性，限制了在真实世界任务中的适用性。动态非结构化环境中的机器人操作需要利用已知和不确定信息的安全机制

Method: 结合密集参数rollout和并行稀疏重评估关键状态转换，使用广义安全因子评估稳定抓取和执行器限制，通过探测动作进行针对性不确定性降低

Result: 在模拟双手机器人操作任务中（物体质量和摩擦系数不确定），能够高效识别和过滤不安全轨迹

Conclusion: 基于物理的稀疏安全评估是处理不确定性下安全机器人操作的可扩展策略

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in dynamic and unstructured environments requires safety
mechanisms that exploit what is known and what is uncertain about the world.
Existing safety filters often assume full observability, limiting their
applicability in real-world tasks. We propose a physics-based safety filtering
scheme that leverages high-fidelity simulation to assess control policies under
uncertainty in world parameters. The method combines dense rollout with nominal
parameters and parallelizable sparse re-evaluation at critical
state-transitions, quantified through generalized factors of safety for stable
grasping and actuator limits, and targeted uncertainty reduction through
probing actions. We demonstrate the approach in a simulated bimanual
manipulation task with uncertain object mass and friction, showing that unsafe
trajectories can be identified and filtered efficiently. Our results highlight
physics-based sparse safety evaluation as a scalable strategy for safe robotic
manipulation under uncertainty.

Motivation: 多机器人神经隐式建图需要应对通信挑战（如丢包和带宽限制），现有方法在极低通信成功率下性能仍会下降

Method: 提出不确定性加权分布式优化：不确定性加权优先处理地图中更可靠的部分，分布式优化隔离并惩罚通信智能体对之间的建图分歧

Result: 在标准基准数据集和真实机器人硬件上的实验表明，UDON显著优于现有基线，即使在极端通信退化情况下也能保持高保真重建和一致的场景表示

Conclusion: UDON框架通过创新的不确定性加权分布式优化方法，成功解决了多机器人神经隐式建图在严重通信退化条件下的性能问题

Abstract: Multi-robot mapping with neural implicit representations enables the compact
reconstruction of complex environments. However, it demands robustness against
communication challenges like packet loss and limited bandwidth. While prior
works have introduced various mechanisms to mitigate communication disruptions,
performance degradation still occurs under extremely low communication success
rates. This paper presents UDON, a real-time multi-agent neural implicit
mapping framework that introduces a novel uncertainty-weighted distributed
optimization to achieve high-quality mapping under severe communication
deterioration. The uncertainty weighting prioritizes more reliable portions of
the map, while the distributed optimization isolates and penalizes mapping
disagreement between individual pairs of communicating agents. We conduct
extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world robot
hardware. We demonstrate that UDON significantly outperforms existing
baselines, maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions and consistent scene
representations even under extreme communication degradation (as low as 1%
success rate).

TL;DR: MoiréTac是一种双模式视觉触觉传感器，通过重叠微光栅产生密集的莫尔条纹模式，实现了高分辨率触觉感知和视觉功能的结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉触觉传感器使用稀疏标记阵列，空间分辨率有限且缺乏明确的分析力-图像关系。需要开发一种能够同时提供高分辨率触觉感知和视觉功能的新型传感器。

Method: 采用透明架构中的重叠微光栅设计，产生放大微观变形的莫尔条纹模式。结合基于物理的特征（亮度、相位梯度、方向和周期）和深度空间特征，通过端到端学习实现可解释的回归映射到6轴力/力矩测量。

Conclusion: MoiréTac传感器成功解决了传统传感器的局限性，实现了同时的高分辨率触觉感知和视觉功能，在灵巧操作中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors typically employ sparse marker arrays that limit spatial
resolution and lack clear analytical force-to-image relationships. To solve
this problem, we present \textbf{Moir\'eTac}, a dual-mode sensor that generates
dense interference patterns via overlapping micro-gratings within a transparent
architecture. When two gratings overlap with misalignment, they create moir\'e
patterns that amplify microscopic deformations. The design preserves optical
clarity for vision tasks while producing continuous moir\'e fields for tactile
sensing, enabling simultaneous 6-axis force/torque measurement, contact
localization, and visual perception. We combine physics-based features
(brightness, phase gradient, orientation, and period) from moir\'e patterns
with deep spatial features. These are mapped to 6-axis force/torque
measurements, enabling interpretable regression through end-to-end learning.
Experimental results demonstrate three capabilities: force/torque measurement
with R^2 > 0.98 across tested axes; sensitivity tuning through geometric
parameters (threefold gain adjustment); and vision functionality for object
classification despite moir\'e overlay. Finally, we integrate the sensor into a
robotic arm for cap removal with coordinated force and torque control,
validating its potential for dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry
4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in
Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in
anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous
anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors
overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots
are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user
experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in
advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their
lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown,
when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories
and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement
after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with
generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage
thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal
difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational
autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the
thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from
emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.

Abstract: Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives
of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and
comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging
deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements
throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions
-- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world
applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system
capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as
robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy
trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to
fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal
feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's
adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in
simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human
study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully
dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being
adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior
baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback. Video are available at

Abstract: This paper explores traversability estimation for robot navigation. A key
bottleneck in traversability estimation lies in efficiently achieving reliable
and robust predictions while accurately encoding both geometric and semantic
information across diverse environments. We introduce Navigation via Mixture of
Experts (NAVMOE), a hierarchical and modular approach for traversability
estimation and local navigation. NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models
for specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based
or a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain
types. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based
on the input environment through a gating network. Overall, our approach offers
three advantages: First, NAVMOE enables traversability estimation to adaptively
leverage specialized approaches for different terrains, which enhances
generalization across diverse and unseen environments. Second, our approach
significantly improves efficiency with negligible cost of solution quality by
introducing a training-free lazy gating mechanism, which is designed to
minimize the number of activated experts during inference. Third, our approach
uses a two-stage training strategy that enables the training for the gating
networks within the hybrid MoE method that contains nondifferentiable modules.
Extensive experiments show that NAVMOE delivers a better efficiency and
performance balance than any individual expert or full ensemble across
different domains, improving cross- domain generalization and reducing average
computational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating, with less than a 2% loss in path
quality.

TL;DR: ActOwL框架通过主动提问和LLM常识推理，让机器人高效学习物品所有权信息，显著提升所有权聚类准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在家庭和办公环境中需要理解物品所有权来正确执行指令，但仅凭视觉特征无法可靠推断所有权关系

Method: 使用概率生成模型主动生成最大化信息增益的所有权相关问题，结合LLM常识知识预分类共享/私有物品，仅对私有物品进行提问

Result: 在模拟家庭环境和真实实验室环境中，ActOwL以更少的问题实现了显著更高的所有权聚类准确率

Conclusion: 主动推理与LLM引导的常识推理相结合，有效提升了机器人获取所有权知识的能力，为实际和社交适当的任务执行提供了支持

Abstract: Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object
ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.''
However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To
address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework
that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to
users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that
maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to
improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge
from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared
or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through
experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory
setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy
with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense
reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge
for practical and socially appropriate task execution.

Result: 大量实验验证了所提方法在各种场景下实现精确跟踪和安全着陆技能

Conclusion: 该方法能够使四足机器人在复杂地形上实现自适应和安全着陆

Abstract: Jumping constitutes an essential component of quadruped robots' locomotion
capabilities, which includes dynamic take-off and adaptive landing. Existing
quadrupedal jumping studies mainly focused on the stance and flight phase by
assuming a flat landing ground, which is impractical in many real world cases.
This work proposes a safe landing framework that achieves adaptive landing on
rough terrains by combining Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement
Learning (RL) together. The RL agent learns to track the reference motion
generated by TO in the environments with rough terrains. To enable the learning
of compliant landing skills on challenging terrains, a reward relaxation
strategy is synthesized to encourage exploration during landing recovery
period. Extensive experiments validate the accurate tracking and safe landing
skills benefiting from our proposed method in various scenarios.

Conclusion: S-MSP框架展示了直接从感知输入处理时空逻辑规划任务的实用性，为机器人在复杂环境中的任务和运动规划提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We investigate the task and motion planning problem for Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) specifications in robotics. Existing STL methods rely on pre-defined maps
or mobility representations, which are ineffective in unstructured real-world
environments. We propose the \emph{Structured-MoE STL Planner}
(\textbf{S-MSP}), a differentiable framework that maps synchronized multi-view
camera observations and an STL specification directly to a feasible trajectory.
S-MSP integrates STL constraints within a unified pipeline, trained with a
composite loss that combines trajectory reconstruction and STL robustness. A
\emph{structure-aware} Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model enables horizon-aware
specialization by projecting sub-tasks into temporally anchored embeddings. We
evaluate S-MSP using a high-fidelity simulation of factory-logistics scenarios
with temporally constrained tasks. Experiments show that S-MSP outperforms
single-expert baselines in STL satisfaction and trajectory feasibility. A
rule-based \emph{safety filter} at inference improves physical executability
without compromising logical correctness, showcasing the practicality of the
approach.

Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and
autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To
bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal
displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most
existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more
specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise
spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused
by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and
extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of
discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time
state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the
increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial
platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one
minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.
To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be
open-source.

Result: 提出了一个综合框架，将方案理论与认知架构相结合，能够更好地表示代理技能并理解技能转移机制。焊接案例研究表明该方法能够捕捉操作员面临的复杂感知-决策-行动循环挑战。

Conclusion: 整合方案理论和认知架构模型为人类操作员技能建模提供了有前景的途径，特别是在需要实时技能适应和延迟反馈的复杂工业环境中，如焊接操作。这种方法对于工业5.0时代的人机协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction is increasingly important in industry, and this
trend will only intensify with the rise of Industry 5.0. Human operators have
skills that need to be adapted when using machines to achieve the best results.
It is crucial to highlight the operator's skills and understand how they use
and adapt them [18]. A rigorous description of these skills is necessary to
compare performance with and without robot assistance. Predicate logic, used by
Vergnaud within Piaget's scheme concept, offers a promising approach. However,
this theory doesn't account for cognitive system constraints, such as the
timing of actions, the limitation of cognitive resources, the parallelization
of tasks, or the activation of automatic gestures contrary to optimal
knowledge. Integrating these constraints is essential for representing agent
skills understanding skill transfer between biological and mechanical
structures. Cognitive architectures models [2] address these needs by
describing cognitive structure and can be combined with the scheme for mutual
benefit. Welding provides a relevant case study, as it highlights the
challenges faced by operators, even highly skilled ones. Welding's complexity
stems from the need for constant skill adaptation to variable parameters like
part position and process. This adaptation is crucial, as weld quality, a key
factor, is only assessed afterward via destructive testing. Thus, the welder is
confronted with a complex perception-decision-action cycle, where the
evaluation of the impact of his actions is delayed and where errors are
definitive. This dynamic underscores the importance of understanding and
modeling the skills of operators.

Conclusion: 该学习型控制框架能有效实现安全的颅内压波形调制，为研究神经系统疾病提供了新的实验工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a learning-based control framework for a soft robotic
actuator system designed to modulate intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms,
which is essential for studying cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and pathological
processes underlying neurological disorders. A two-layer framework is proposed
to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive
controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking
of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints.
Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor
position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online
learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP
modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a
brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a
previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC
reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and
73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor
position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean
and amplitude.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has produced remarkable advances in humanoid
locomotion, yet a fundamental dilemma persists for real-world deployment:
policies must choose between the robustness of reactive proprioceptive control
or the proactivity of complex, fragile perception-driven systems. This paper
resolves this dilemma by introducing a paradigm that imbues a purely
proprioceptive policy with proactive capabilities, achieving the foresight of
perception without its deployment-time costs. Our core contribution is a
contrastive learning framework that compels the actor's latent state to encode
privileged environmental information from simulation. Crucially, this
``distilled awareness" empowers an adaptive gait clock, allowing the policy to
proactively adjust its rhythm based on an inferred understanding of the
terrain. This synergy resolves the classic trade-off between rigid, clocked
gaits and unstable clock-free policies. We validate our approach with zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer to a full-sized humanoid, demonstrating highly robust
locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm high steps and 26.5{\deg}
slopes, proving the effectiveness of our method. Website:

Abstract: Safe and scalable deployment of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving requires
extensive and diverse data, particularly safety-critical events. Existing data
are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or
collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents
TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and
geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at
anywhere in the world. Starting from an arbitrary location, TeraSim-World
retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources.
Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and
orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street
views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded
sensor rendering via the frontier video generation model Cosmos-Drive. By
bridging agent and sensor simulations, TeraSim-World provides a scalable and
critical~data synthesis framework for training and evaluation of E2E autonomous
driving systems.

Conclusion: GRATE通过结合图Transformer和卡尔曼滤波，显著提升了自主机器人探索的效率和可行性，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous robot exploration (ARE) is the process of a robot autonomously
navigating and mapping an unknown environment. Recent Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making
problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods
often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data.
Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting
RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while
neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph
Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global
contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's
reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a
Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path
is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5%
in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art
conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We
also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.

Method: 扩展现有责任度量框架，引入时间归一化建模冲突积累阶段，并提出参与度度量来捕捉冲突激化行为。通过模拟场景（二元、群体和人群交互）进行验证。

Conclusion: 提出的责任和参与度度量为社交机器人导航提供了有价值的评估工具，但需要进一步讨论其适用性、设计选择和局限性。

Abstract: In Social Robot Navigation (SRN), the availability of meaningful metrics is
crucial for evaluating trajectories from human-robot interactions. In the SRN
context, such interactions often relate to resolving conflicts between two or
more agents. Correspondingly, the shares to which agents contribute to the
resolution of such conflicts are important. This paper builds on recent work,
which proposed a Responsibility metric capturing such shares. We extend this
framework in two directions: First, we model the conflict buildup phase by
introducing a time normalization. Second, we propose the related Engagement
metric, which captures how the agents' actions intensify a conflict. In a
comprehensive series of simulated scenarios with dyadic, group and crowd
interactions, we show that the metrics carry meaningful information about the
cooperative resolution of conflicts in interactions. They can be used to assess
behavior quality and foresightedness. We extensively discuss applicability,
design choices and limitations of the proposed metrics.

Result: 开发了能够评估人机交互质量的新指标，可以显示算法对减少冲突的贡献程度以及责任分配情况

Abstract: Establishing standardized metrics for Social Robot Navigation (SRN)
algorithms for assessing the quality and social compliance of robot behavior
around humans is essential for SRN research. Currently, commonly used
evaluation metrics lack the ability to quantify how cooperative an agent
behaves in interaction with humans. Concretely, in a simple frontal approach
scenario, no metric specifically captures if both agents cooperate or if one
agent stays on collision course and the other agent is forced to evade. To
address this limitation, we propose two new metrics, a conflict intensity
metric and the responsibility metric. Together, these metrics are capable of
evaluating the quality of human-robot interactions by showing how much a given
algorithm has contributed to reducing a conflict and which agent actually took
responsibility of the resolution. This work aims to contribute to the
development of a comprehensive and standardized evaluation methodology for SRN,
ultimately enhancing the safety, efficiency, and social acceptance of robots in
human-centric environments.

Abstract: Laser vision sensors (LVS) are critical perception modules for industrial
robots, facilitating real-time acquisition of workpiece geometric data in
welding applications. However, the camera communication delay will lead to a
temporal desynchronization between captured images and the robot motions.
Additionally, hand-eye extrinsic parameters may vary during prolonged
measurement. To address these issues, we introduce a measurement model of LVS
considering the effect of the camera's time-offset and propose a teaching-free
spatiotemporal calibration method utilizing line constraints. This method
involves a robot equipped with an LVS repeatedly scanning straight-line fillet
welds using S-shaped trajectories. Regardless of the robot's orientation
changes, all measured welding positions are constrained to a straight-line,
represented by Plucker coordinates. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization model
based on straight-line constraints is established. Subsequently, the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is employed to optimize parameters,
including time-offset, hand-eye extrinsic parameters, and straight-line
parameters. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach are
quantitatively validated through experiments on curved weld scanning. We
open-sourced the code, dataset, and simulation report at

Abstract: Anthropomorphic underactuated hands are widely employed for their versatility
and structural simplicity. In such systems, compact sensing integration and
proper interpretation aligned with underactuation are crucial for realizing
practical grasp functionalities. This study proposes an anthropomorphic
underactuated hand that achieves comprehensive situational awareness of
hand-object interaction, utilizing tendon-based proprioception provided by
series elastic actuators (SEAs). We developed a compact SEA with high accuracy
and reliability that can be seamlessly integrated into sensorless fingers. By
coupling proprioceptive sensing with potential energy-based modeling, the
system estimates key grasp-related variables, including contact timing, joint
angles, relative object stiffness, and finger configuration changes indicating
external disturbances. These estimated variables enable grasp posture
reconstruction, safe handling of deformable objects, and blind grasping with
proprioceptive-only recognition of objects with varying geometry and stiffness.
Finger-level experiments and hand-level demonstrations confirmed the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that
tendon-based proprioception serves as a compact and robust sensing modality for
practical manipulation without reliance on vision or tactile feedback.

for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with
predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even
in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an
explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering
insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of
two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another
performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR
behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects
OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance
-- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing
interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.

Result: 大量实验表明该方法实现了优越性能，在SCOUT Mini上的实际部署证实了DVDP的有效性，模型能够生成平滑、可行的对接轨迹，满足物理约束并达到目标姿态。

Abstract: Automatic docking has long been a significant challenge in the field of
mobile robotics. Compared to other automatic docking methods, visual docking
methods offer higher precision and lower deployment costs, making them an
efficient and promising choice for this task. However, visual docking methods
impose strict requirements on the robot's initial position at the start of the
docking process. To overcome the limitations of current vision-based methods,
we propose an innovative end-to-end visual docking method named DVDP(direct
visual docking policy). This approach requires only a binocular RGB-D camera
installed on the mobile robot to directly output the robot's docking path,
achieving end-to-end automatic docking. Furthermore, we have collected a
large-scale dataset of mobile robot visual automatic docking dataset through a
combination of virtual and real environments using the Unity 3D platform and
actual mobile robot setups. We developed a series of evaluation metrics to
quantify the performance of the end-to-end visual docking method. Extensive
experiments, including benchmarks against leading perception backbones adapted
into our framework, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.
Finally, real-world deployment on the SCOUT Mini confirmed DVDP's efficacy,
with our model generating smooth, feasible docking trajectories that meet
physical constraints and reach the target pose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现完全在线分散式的持续监控在安全性、环境监测和灾难恢复等领域具有重要价值，需要机器人团队能够实时适应变化的环境，特别是在路径可通行性高度动态的环境中

Method: 通过分散式多机器人巡逻团队监控和调整环境动态的新方法，使巡逻代理能够观察动态变化并在线分散式地适应

Result: 在高度动态场景中显著优于现实基线方法，并研究了在某些动态场景中显式考虑环境动态可能不必要或不切实际的情况

Conclusion: 该方法为分散式多机器人持续监控提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在高度动态环境中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Persistent monitoring using robot teams is of interest in fields such as
security, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. Performing such
monitoring in a fully on-line decentralised fashion has significant potential
advantages for robustness, adaptability, and scalability of monitoring
solutions, including, in principle, the capacity to effectively adapt in
real-time to a changing environment. We examine this through the lens of
multi-robot patrol, in which teams of patrol robots must persistently minimise
time between visits to points of interest, within environments where
traversability of routes is highly dynamic. These dynamics must be observed by
patrol agents and accounted for in a fully decentralised on-line manner. In
this work, we present a new method of monitoring and adjusting for environment
dynamics in a decentralised multi-robot patrol team. We demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic
scenarios, and also investigate dynamic scenarios in which explicitly
accounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仿人机械手设计限制了抓取范围和能力，需要开发一种既能扩大工作空间又能减少复杂度的新型机械手设计。

Method: 采用16自由度设计，将第四和第五手指的内收/外展关节合并为单个大范围运动关节，结合强化学习进行抓取策略研究，并通过遥操作实验验证性能。

Result: 合并关节使手指工作空间增加400%，可抓取侧向距离达200mm的物体，遥操作试验中对合适YCB物体的抓取成功率达到86%，包括非仿人构型的挑战性抓取。

Conclusion: 该设计在不增加复杂性的情况下显著提升了抓取稳定性、灵活性和灵巧操作能力，适用于广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper presents the SABD hand, a 16-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic hand
that departs from purely anthropomorphic designs to achieve an expanded grasp
envelope, enable manipulation poses beyond human capability, and reduce the
required number of actuators. This is achieved by combining the
adduction/abduction (Add/Abd) joint of digits four and five into a single joint
with a large range of motion. The combined joint increases the workspace of the
digits by 400\% and reduces the required DoFs while retaining dexterity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the combined Add/Abd joint enables the
hand to grasp objects with a side distance of up to 200 mm. Reinforcement
learning-based investigations show that the design enables grasping policies
that are effective not only for handling larger objects but also for achieving
enhanced grasp stability. In teleoperated trials, the hand successfully
performed 86\% of attempted grasps on suitable YCB objects, including
challenging non-anthropomorphic configurations. These findings validate the
design's ability to enhance grasp stability, flexibility, and dexterous
manipulation without added complexity, making it well-suited for a wide range
of applications.

Abstract: Although robotic manipulators are used in an ever-growing range of
applications, robot manufacturers typically follow a ``one-fits-all''
philosophy, employing identical manipulators in various settings. This often
leads to suboptimal performance, as general-purpose designs fail to exploit
particularities of tasks. The development of custom, task-tailored robots is
hindered by long, cost-intensive development cycles and the high cost of
customized hardware. Recently, various computational design methods have been
devised to overcome the bottleneck of human engineering. In addition, a surge
of modular robots allows quick and economical adaptation to changing industrial
settings. This work proposes an approach to automatically designing and
optimizing robot morphologies tailored to a specific environment. To this end,
we learn the inverse kinematics for a wide range of different manipulators. A
fully differentiable framework realizes gradient-based fine-tuning of designed
robots and inverse kinematics solutions. Our generative approach accelerates
the generation of specialized designs from hours with optimization-based
methods to seconds, serving as a design co-pilot that enables instant
adaptation and effective human-AI collaboration. Numerical experiments show
that our approach finds robots that can navigate cluttered environments,
manipulators that perform well across a specified workspace, and can be adapted
to different hardware constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our method by setting up a modular robot designed in
simulation that successfully moves through an obstacle course.

Conclusion: SeqWM框架有效解决了多机器人协作中的复杂动力学问题，实现了优异的性能和样本效率，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in
robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However,
extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the
complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World
Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into
model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent,
sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint
dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential
communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its
actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables
explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces
communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated
environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing
state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall
performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative
behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM
has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems. Demos and code are available

Conclusion: 该非完整水弹性模型成功解决了柔顺触觉传感器复杂动力学的建模问题，为高分辨率触觉反馈的集成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Tactile sensors have long been valued for their perceptual capabilities,
offering rich insights into the otherwise hidden interface between the robot
and grasped objects. Yet their inherent compliance -- a key driver of
force-rich interactions -- remains underexplored. The central challenge is to
capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics introduced by these passive-compliant
elements. Here, we present a computationally efficient non-holonomic
hydroelastic model that accurately models path-dependent contact force
distributions and dynamic surface area variations. Our insight is to extend the
object's state space, explicitly incorporating the distributed forces generated
by the compliant sensor. Our differentiable formulation not only accounts for
path-dependent behavior but also enables gradient-based trajectory
optimization, seamlessly integrating with high-resolution tactile feedback. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of simulated and
real-world experiments and highlight the importance of modeling the path
dependence of sensor dynamics.

Motivation: 密集动态环境中的自动驾驶需要能够利用空间结构和长时域时间依赖性的决策系统，同时保持对不确定性的鲁棒性。需要解决频繁低风险状态和罕见安全关键决策之间的不平衡问题

Method: 集成多通道鸟瞰图占用网格与基于变换器的序列建模。使用冻结教师变换器估计每个token的预测熵，作为学生模型损失函数中的权重，增强对不确定高影响状态的学习

Result: 在环岛模拟器中，UWDT在不同交通密度下始终优于其他基线方法，在奖励、碰撞率和行为稳定性方面表现更好

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的时空变换器可以在复杂交通环境中为自动驾驶提供更安全高效的决策

Abstract: Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making
systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal
dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel
framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with
transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout
scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare
safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision
Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate
per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student
model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain,
high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk
transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic
densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of
reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that
uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more
efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

Motivation: 连续体机器人在支气管镜检查中具有优势，但缺乏真实的训练和测试环境，真实数据收集受伦理和安全限制，需要开发能够提供真实成像和物理反馈的仿真工具。

Method: 利用患者CT扫描，生成包括RGB图像（含真实噪声和光反射）、度量深度图、表面法线、光流和点云等多模态传感器数据，并在医学相关尺度上进行渲染。

Result: 在医疗机器人的两个典型任务（多视角姿态估计和单目深度估计）中验证了ROOM生成的数据质量，展示了现有方法在医疗场景中面临的挑战，并证明可以通过微调现有深度估计模型来克服这些挑战。

Conclusion: ROOM框架能够在大规模患者解剖结构和程序场景中生成数据，这些数据在临床环境中难以获取，有望推动医疗机器人技术的发展。

Abstract: Continuum robots are advancing bronchoscopy procedures by accessing complex
lung airways and enabling targeted interventions. However, their development is
limited by the lack of realistic training and test environments: Real data is
difficult to collect due to ethical constraints and patient safety concerns,
and developing autonomy algorithms requires realistic imaging and physical
feedback. We present ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), a
comprehensive simulation framework designed for generating photorealistic
bronchoscopy training data. By leveraging patient CT scans, our pipeline
renders multi-modal sensor data including RGB images with realistic noise and
light specularities, metric depth maps, surface normals, optical flow and point
clouds at medically relevant scales. We validate the data generated by ROOM in
two canonical tasks for medical robotics -- multi-view pose estimation and
monocular depth estimation, demonstrating diverse challenges that
state-of-the-art methods must overcome to transfer to these medical settings.
Furthermore, we show that the data produced by ROOM can be used to fine-tune
existing depth estimation models to overcome these challenges, also enabling
other downstream applications such as navigation. We expect that ROOM will
enable large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and
procedural scenarios that are challenging to capture in clinical settings. Code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人需要在人类环境中操作，开门是基本但具有挑战性的技能。开门任务存在部分可观测性（如门锁状态不可见），导致标准行为克隆容易出现模式崩溃问题，产生混合或顺序错误的动作。

Conclusion: 阶段条件化是一种轻量级但强大的机制，能够有效处理长时域的人形机器人移动操作任务中的部分可观测性问题。

Abstract: Humanoid robots promise to operate in everyday human environments without
requiring modifications to the surroundings. Among the many skills needed,
opening doors is essential, as doors are the most common gateways in built
spaces and often limit where a robot can go. Door opening, however, poses
unique challenges as it is a long-horizon task under partial observability,
such as reasoning about the door's unobservable latch state that dictates
whether the robot should rotate the handle or push the door. This ambiguity
makes standard behavior cloning prone to mode collapse, yielding blended or
out-of-sequence actions. We introduce StageACT, a stage-conditioned imitation
learning framework that augments low-level policies with task-stage inputs.
This effective addition increases robustness to partial observability, leading
to higher success rates and shorter completion times. On a humanoid operating
in a real-world office environment, StageACT achieves a 55% success rate on
previously unseen doors, more than doubling the best baseline. Moreover, our
method supports intentional behavior guidance through stage prompting, enabling
recovery behaviors. These results highlight stage conditioning as a lightweight
yet powerful mechanism for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation.

Abstract: We present a hierarchical RL pipeline for training one-armed legged robots to
perform pick-and-place (P&P) tasks end-to-end -- from approaching the payload
to releasing it at a target area -- in both single-robot and cooperative
dual-robot settings. We introduce a novel dynamic reward curriculum that
enables a single policy to efficiently learn long-horizon P&P operations by
progressively guiding the agents through payload-centered sub-objectives.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches for long-horizon RL tasks, our method
improves training efficiency by 55% and reduces execution time by 18.6% in
simulation experiments. In the dual-robot case, we show that our policy enables
each robot to attend to different components of its observation space at
distinct task stages, promoting effective coordination via autonomous attention
shifts. We validate our method through real-world experiments using ANYmal D
platforms in both single- and dual-robot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is
the first RL pipeline that tackles the full scope of collaborative P&P with two
legged manipulators.

Abstract: The endurance and energy efficiency of drones remain critical challenges in
their design and operation. To extend mission duration, numerous studies
explored perching mechanisms that enable drones to conserve energy by
temporarily suspending flight. This paper presents a new perching drone that
utilizes an active flexible perching mechanism inspired by the rapid predation
mechanism of the Venus flytrap, achieving perching in less than 100 ms. The
proposed system is designed for high-speed adaptability to the perching
targets. The overall drone design is outlined, followed by the development and
validation of the biomimetic perching structure. To enhance the system
stability, a cascade extended high-gain observer (EHGO) based control method is
developed, which can estimate and compensate for the external disturbance in
real time. The experimental results demonstrate the adaptability of the
perching structure and the superiority of the cascaded EHGO in resisting wind
and perching disturbances.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决大规模用户参与的需求响应问题提供了理论保证和实用算法，显著提升了处理用户规模的能力。

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy introduces a great challenge
to the supply and demand balance of the power grid. To address this challenge,
this paper formulates a Stackelberg Markov game (SMG) between an aggregator and
multiple users, where the aggregator sets electricity prices and users make
demand and storage decisions. Considering that users' storage levels are
private information, we introduce private states and propose the new concepts
of private Markovian strategies (PMS) and private Markovian equilibrium (PME).
We establish the existence of a pure PME in the lower-level Markov game and
prove that it can be computed in polynomial time. Notably, computing
equilibrium in general Markov games is hard, and polynomial-time algorithms are
rarely available. Based on these theoretical results, we develop a scalable
solution framework combining centralized and decentralized algorithms for the
lower-level PME computation with upper-level pricing optimization. Numerical
simulations with up to 50 users based on real data validate the effectiveness
and scalability of the proposed methods, whereas prior studies typically
consider no more than 5 users.

Abstract: This paper presents a cost optimization framework for electric vehicle (EV)
charging stations that leverages on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation and
explicitly accounts for electricity price uncertainty through a Bertsimas--Sim
robust formulation. The model is formulated as a linear program that satisfies
vehicle energy demands, respects charging and grid capacity constraints, and
minimizes procurement cost. Evaluations on real charging data from the Caltech
ACN dataset show average savings of about 12\% compared to a
first-come--first-served baseline, with peak monthly reductions up to 19.2\%. A
lightweight sensitivity analysis indicates that a modest $\sim$5\% increase in
nominal cost can reduce worst-case exposure by 14\%. Computational tests
confirm real-time feasibility, with instances of up to 50 concurrent EVs solved
in under 5 seconds on a standard laptop. The proposed method provides a
practical, grid-friendly, and scalable solution for future EV charging

TL;DR: 提出基于元模型神经过程(MMNP)的拓扑自适应概率潮流计算方法，解决传统PPF方法在电网拓扑变化时需要重新训练的局限性，通过上下文集合表示和条件分布学习技术，实现N-1拓扑变化下的自适应求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概率潮流(PPF)方法假设固定拓扑，当电网拓扑发生变化(如线路故障)时需要重新训练模型，这在可再生能源和电动汽车普及导致更多电网波动的情况下带来计算负担和不便。

Method: 采用元模型神经过程(MMNP)，利用上下文集合表示拓扑信息，通过条件分布函数学习技术，使模型能够适应不同拓扑配置而无需重新训练。

Result: 在IEEE 9总线和118总线系统上的仿真验证显示，最大%L1相对误差范数分别为1.11%和0.77%，表明方法具有良好的精度和适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了PPF方法在电网波动加剧时代的关键空白，通过拓扑自适应能力显著提高了概率潮流计算的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: The probabilistic power flow (PPF) problem is essential to quantifying the
distribution of the nodal voltages due to uncertain injections. The
conventional PPF problem considers a fixed topology, and the solutions to such
a PPF problem are associated with this topology. A change in the topology might
alter the power flow patterns and thus require the PPF problem to be solved
again. The previous PPF model and its solutions are no longer valid for the new
topology. This practice incurs both inconvenience and computation burdens as
more contingencies are foreseen due to high renewables and a large share of
electric vehicles. This paper presents a novel topology-adaptive approach,
based on the meta-model Neural Process (MMNP), for finding the solutions to PPF
problems under varying N-1 topologies, particularly with one-line failures. By
leveraging context set-based topology representation and conditional
distribution over function learning techniques, the proposed MMNP enhances the
robustness of PPF models to topology variations, mitigating the need for
retraining PPF models on a new configuration. Simulations on an IEEE 9-bus
system and IEEE 118-bus system validate the model's performance. The maximum
%L1-relative error norm was observed as 1.11% and 0.77% in 9-bus and 118-bus,
respectively. This adaptive approach fills a critical gap in PPF methodology in
an era of increasing grid volatility.

Motivation: 研究在需求不确定性和跳跃动态下可再生能源容量安装的优化问题，为长期可再生能源扩展提供决策支持框架

Method: 1) 基于阈值的控制规则：当随机容量因子低于固定水平时按比例增加容量，通过非线性偏积分微分方程(PIDE)求解；2) 深度控制算法：使用神经网络直接学习最优反馈策略，最小化期望成本函数

Result: 数值实验显示两种方法各有优势：阈值BSDE方法具有可解释性和易处理性，深度控制策略通过灵活的容量分配实现更好的性能

Conclusion: 两种工具共同为不确定性下的长期可再生能源扩展决策提供了稳健的框架

Abstract: We study a stochastic model for the installation of renewable energy capacity
under demand uncertainty and jump driven dynamics. The system is governed by a
multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process driven by a subordinator,
capturing abrupt variations in renewable generation and electricity load.
Installation decisions are modeled through control actions that increase
capacity in response to environmental and economic conditions.
  We consider two distinct solution approaches. First, we implement a
structured threshold based control rule, where capacity is increased
proportionally when the stochastic capacity factor falls below a fixed level.
This formulation leads to a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation
(PIDE), which we solve by reformulating it as a backward stochastic
differential equation with jumps. We extend the DBDP solver in
\cite{hure2020deep} to the pure jump setting, employing a dual neural network
architecture to approximate both the value function and the jump sensitivity.
  Second, we propose a fully data driven deep control algorithm that directly
learns the optimal feedback policy by minimizing the expected cost functional
using neural networks. This approach avoids assumptions on the form of the
control rule and enables adaptive interventions based on the evolving system
state.
  Numerical experiments highlight the strengths of both methods. While the
threshold based BSDE approach offers interpretability and tractability, the
deep control strategy achieves improved performance through flexibility in
capacity allocation. Together, these tools provide a robust framework for
decision support in long term renewable energy expansion under uncertainty.

Abstract: With recent advancements in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Green Light
Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) emerges as a promising eco-driving strategy to
reduce the number of stops and idle time at intersections, thereby reducing
energy consumption and emissions. Existing studies typically improve energy and
travel efficiency for individual CAVs without considering their impacts on the
entire mixed-traffic platoon, leading to inefficient traffic flow. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to achieve platoon-level control
in a mixed-traffic environment, the training of RL is still challenged by (i)
car-following safety, i.e., CAVs should not collide with their immediate
preceding vehicles, and (ii) red-light safety, i.e., CAVs should not run red
lights. To address these challenges, this paper develops a platoon-centric,
safe RL-based GLOSA system that uses a multi-agent controller to optimize CAV
speed while achieving a balance between energy consumption and travel
efficiency. We further incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the
RL-based policy to provide explicit safety guarantees in terms of car-following
safety and red-light safety. Our simulation results illustrate that our
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of driving safety
and platoon energy consumption.

Abstract: Various neural network architectures are used in many of the state-of-the-art
approaches for real-time nonlinear state estimation in dynamical systems. With
the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the
estimation domain, models with reliable margins of error are required --
especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses a novel
hybrid, data-driven state estimation approach based on the physics-informed
attentive neural process (PI-AttNP), a model-informed extension of the
attentive neural process (AttNP). We augment this estimation approach with the
regression-based split conformal prediction (CP) framework to obtain quantified
model uncertainty with probabilistic guarantees. After presenting the algorithm
in a generic form, we validate its performance in the task of grey-box state
estimation of a simulated under-actuated six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor with
multimodal Gaussian sensor noise and several external perturbations typical to
quadrotors. Further, we compare outcomes with state-of-the-art data-driven
methods, which provide significant evidence of the physics-informed neural
process as a viable novel approach for model-driven estimation.

Abstract: This short note gives a new framework for dealing with nonlinear sampled-data
systems. We introduce a new idea of lifting, which is well known for linear
systems, but not successfully generalized to nonlinear systems. This paper
introduces a new lifting technique for nonlinear, time-invariant systems, which
are different from the linear counterpart as developed in [Bamieh et al. 1991,
Yamamoto 1994], etc. The main difficulty is that the direct feedthrough term
effective in the linear case cannot be generalized to the nonlinear case.
Instead, we will further lift the state trajectory, and obtain an equivalent
time-invariant discrete-time system with function-space input and output
spaces. The basic framework, as well as the closed-loop equation with a
discrete-time controller, is given. As an application of this framework, we
give a representation for the Koopman operator derived from the given original
nonlinear system.

Conclusion: MAPS为不确定时变环境中的摩擦感知自适应控制提供了鲁棒、可推广的解决方案，具有实际实时应用价值

Abstract: This paper proposes Mode-Aware Probabilistic Scheduling (MAPS), a novel
adaptive control framework tailored for DC motor systems experiencing varying
friction. MAPS uniquely integrates an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM)
estimator with a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) based control strategy,
leveraging real-time mode probability estimates to perform probabilistic gain
scheduling. A key innovation of MAPS lies in directly using the updated mode
probabilities as the interpolation weights for online gain synthesis in the LPV
controller, thereby tightly coupling state estimation with adaptive control.
This seamless integration enables the controller to dynamically adapt control
gains in real time, effectively responding to changes in frictional operating
modes without requiring explicit friction model identification. Validation on a
Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) environment demonstrates that MAPS
significantly enhances both state estimation accuracy and reference tracking
performance compared to Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllers relying on
predefined scheduling variables. These results establish MAPS as a robust,
generalizable solution for friction-aware adaptive control in uncertain,
time-varying environments, with practical real-time applicability.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
future 6G networks, offering task-oriented and meaning-aware transmission that
fundamentally redefines traditional bit-centric design. Recognized by leading
standardization bodies including the institute of electrical and electronics
engineers (IEEE) and the international telecommunication union (ITU), and
actively discussed within the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) working
groups, SemCom is rapidly gaining traction as a foundational enabler for
native-AI 6G. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress
in SemCom from both academic and industrial perspectives, with a focus on its
ongoing and upcoming standardization activities. We systematically examine
advances in representative application scenarios, architectural design,
semantic-traditional system compatibility, unified evaluation metrics, and
validation methodologies. Furthermore, we highlight several key enabling
technologies, such as joint source-channel coding (JSCC), SemCom-based multiple
access (MA) technologies such as model division MA (MDMA), and semantic
knowledge base (KB), that support the practical implementation of SemCom in
standard-compliant systems. Additionally, we present a case study for channel
state information (CSI) feedback, illustrating the concrete performance gains
of SemCom under 3GPP-compliant fading channels. Finally, we discuss emerging
challenges and research opportunities for incorporating semantic-native
mechanisms into the evolving 6G standardization landscape, and provide
forward-looking insights into its development and global adoption.

Abstract: Ellipsoidal tube-based model predictive control methods effectively account
for the propagation of the reachable set, typically employing linear feedback
policies. In contrast, scenario-based approaches offer more flexibility in the
feedback structure by considering different control actions for different
branches of a scenario tree. However, they face challenges in ensuring rigorous
guarantees. This work aims to integrate the strengths of both methodologies by
enhancing ellipsoidal tube-based MPC with a scenario tree formulation. The
uncertainty ellipsoids are partitioned by halfspaces such that each partitioned
set can be controlled independently. The proposed ellipsoidal multi-stage
approach is demonstrated in a human-robot system, highlighting its advantages
in handling uncertainty while maintaining computational tractability.

Abstract: This paper presents a closed-form analysis of spatial correlation and degrees
of freedom (DoF) for arched holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO)
arrays, which can be viewed as a special form of fluid antenna systems (FAS)
when their geometry is fluidically adaptable. Unlike traditional planar
configurations, practical HMIMO surfaces may exhibit curvature, significantly
influencing their spatial characteristics and performance. We derive exact
correlation expressions for both arched uniform linear arrays and arched
uniform rectangular arrays, capturing curvature effects under far field
propagation. Our results reveal that isotropic scattering results in DoF being
dominated by the maximum span of the HMIMO array, such that shape effects are
weakened, and bending does not significantly reduce the available spatial DoF.
Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the closed-form formulas and
demonstrate the robustness of DoF against curvature variations, supporting
flexible array designs. These findings offer fundamental insights into
geometry-aware optimization for next-generation HMIMO/FAS systems and pave the
way for practical implementations of curved HMIMO arrays.

Abstract: The role of energy communities in grid operations is highly dependent on the
spatial distribution of their participants. In particular, when local energy
producers and consumers are concentrated in different feeders, economic
incentives from energy communities have the potential to affect local grid
congestion. To address this challenge, we propose a feeder-aware allocation
strategy that reflects grid topology in energy sharing. This strategy
prioritizes energy sharing within the same feeder, thus incentivizing local
generation-demand balance and improving grid operation. Different sharing
coefficients are tested, such as equal, proportional, and rank-based, in both
static and dynamic formulations. The proposed strategy is tested on data from a
real energy community, whose participants are assumed to be distributed across
four feeders. The analysis is carried out from the perspectives of the
community as a whole, individual feeders, and single participants. Simulation
results show that the feeder-aware strategy, in addition to promoting local
energy balance, leads to higher and more stable revenues for most participants.

Abstract: Reliable electricity supply depends on the seamless operation of high-voltage
grid infrastructure spanning both transmission and sub-transmission levels.
Beneath this apparent uniformity lies a striking structural diversity, which
leaves a clear imprint on system vulnerability. In this paper, we present
harmonized topological models of the high-voltage grids of 15 European
countries, integrating all elements at voltage levels above 110 kV. Topological
analysis of these networks reveals a simple yet robust pattern: node degree
distributions consistently follow an exponential decay, but the rate of decay
varies significantly across countries. Through a detailed and systematic
evaluation of network tolerance to node and edge removals, we show that the
decay rate delineates the boundary between systems that are more resilient to
failures and those that are prone to large-scale disruptions. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that this numerical boundary is highly sensitive to which layers of
the infrastructure are included in the models. To our knowledge, this study
provides the first quantitative cross-country comparison of 15 European
high-voltage networks, linking topological properties with vulnerability
characteristics.

Abstract: The increasing variety of means of transportation, including light vehicles
like e-scooters and e-bikes, together with the increasing weight of
conventional vehicles due to electrification and consumer preferences for SUVs,
are raising serious concerns regarding the safety of road networks. In this
paper we design a two-level control algorithm to improve the safety of
heterogeneous networks: first, an access control strategy decreases the
heterogeneity of the network depending on actual traffic conditions; then, a
speed control strategy mitigates the probability of serious injuries in
potential collisions. Both control strategies are designed based on momentum
considerations, as this is regarded as the most influential variable to assess
injury risk. The road network mobility simulator SUMO is adopted to implement
and validate our proposed control strategies.

Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD)
constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their
optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide
a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the
full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting
solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The
developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data
increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only
requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the
SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the
error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained
with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.

Abstract: This paper presents MPC-CDF, a new approach integrating control density
functions (CDFs) within a model predictive control (MPC) framework to ensure
safety-critical control in nonlinear dynamical systems. By using the dual
formulation of the navigation problem, we incorporate CDFs into the MPC
framework, ensuring both convergence and safety in a discrete-time setting.
These density functions are endowed with a physical interpretation, where the
associated measure signifies the occupancy of system trajectories. Leveraging
this occupancy-based perspective, we synthesize safety-critical controllers
using the proposed MPC-CDF framework. We illustrate the safety properties of
this framework using a unicycle model and compare it with a control barrier
function-based method. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated in the
autonomous safe navigation of an underwater vehicle, which avoids complex and
arbitrary obstacles while achieving the desired level of safety.

### [246] [Finite-Agent Stochastic Differential Games on Large Graphs: II. Graph-Based Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12484)
*Ruimeng Hu,Jihao Long,Haosheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NTM的新型神经网络架构，用于计算图结构随机微分博弈中的纳什均衡，通过引入图引导的稀疏化和固定非可训练组件来提升可解释性、稳定性并减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构多智能体系统在金融、机器人、能源和社会动力学等领域广泛存在，但现有方法在大规模稀疏设置下计算效率低且缺乏可解释性。需要一种既能保持性能又能提高效率的解决方案。

Method: 设计NTM架构，在图结构上施加稀疏化约束，嵌入固定的非可训练组件与图拓扑对齐。将NTM集成到两种最先进的博弈求解器（Direct Parameterization和Deep BSDE）中，形成稀疏变体NTM-DP和NTM-DBSDE。

Result: 理论证明NTM在静态图博弈中具有通用逼近性质。数值实验表明，基于NTM的方法在各种图结构上实现了与全可训练对应方法相当的性能，同时提供了更好的计算效率。

Conclusion: NTM架构通过结合图结构先验知识，成功地在保持博弈求解性能的同时显著提升了计算效率和模型可解释性，为大规模稀疏图结构多智能体系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable
counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Traces Propagation (TP)方法，一种前向传播、内存高效、可扩展且完全局部的脉冲神经网络学习规则，结合资格迹和分层对比损失，无需辅助矩阵，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脉冲神经网络训练中的时空信用分配问题，BPTT方法不符合生物神经系统的局部性且计算内存需求高，现有局部学习规则需要辅助矩阵导致内存开销大和可扩展性差。

Method: 提出TP方法，结合资格迹和分层对比损失，实现前向传播的完全局部学习，无需辅助层间矩阵，具有内存高效和可扩展性。

Result: 在NMNIST和SHD数据集上优于其他完全局部学习规则，在DVS-GESTURE和DVS-CIFAR10等复杂数据集上表现竞争性，可扩展到VGG-9等深层架构，内存扩展性优于先前方法，适用于关键词识别等实际微调任务。

Conclusion: TP方法为边缘设备的高效学习提供了可行途径，实现了完全局部、内存高效且可扩展的脉冲神经网络训练。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing
dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles
underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to
solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for
training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.
However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality
observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and
memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.
Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment
by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit
assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase
memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this
work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,
scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a
layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP
outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On
more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases
competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such
as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully
local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.
Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such
as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way
for efficient learning at the edge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PowerGrow是一个用于生成电力系统测试案例的协同生成框架，通过依赖分解和分层图beta扩散过程，有效合成电网结构和节点动态，显著降低计算成本并保持运行有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电力系统日益动态化，但由于安全顾虑和匿名化难度，公开测试案例稀缺。需要能够联合生成电网结构和节点动态的生成工具，但建模网络拓扑、分支属性、母线特性和动态负载分布的联合分布仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 采用依赖分解方法，将复杂联合分布分解为可行电网拓扑、时间序列母线负载和其他系统属性的条件分布链。使用分层图beta扩散过程进行结构合成，配合时间自编码器将时间序列数据嵌入紧凑潜在空间。

Result: 在基准测试中，PowerGrow在保真度和多样性方面优于先前的扩散模型，达到98.9%的潮流收敛率和改进的N-1事故恢复能力。

Conclusion: PowerGrow能够生成运行有效且真实的电网场景，为电力系统研究提供了高质量的测试案例生成解决方案。

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DBench基准测试框架和Ada自适应方法，发现在大规模去中心化DNN训练中，模型精度与通信图连接数和参数张量方差相关，Ada方法在1008个GPU上训练ResNet50能达到与中心化学习相当的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管去中心化学习在理论上已被广泛探索，但由于缺乏稳定性、可扩展性和通用性，尚未在生产环境中广泛应用。本研究旨在探索大规模去中心化数据并行训练的实际应用。

Method: 引入DBench基准测试框架，包含中心化和去中心化DNN训练；提出基准测试方法分析模型精度与参数张量方差的关系；基于观察结果提出Ada自适应方法，动态调整通信图。

Result: 发现去中心化训练存在可扩展性和通用性问题；模型精度与通信图连接数相关；对参数张量方差异常敏感；Ada方法在所有样本应用中都能获得最佳收敛率和与中心化学习相当的良好模型精度。

Conclusion: Ada方法能够在大规模去中心化DNN训练中实现与中心化学习相当的性能，为去中心化学习的生产应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

*Xin Tong,Zhi Lin,Jingya Wang,Meng Han,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEUV框架通过将单一拒绝方向分解为多个主题对齐、近乎正交的向量，实现细粒度的能力激活，在保持高攻击成功率的同时显著减少跨主题泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐机制会同时拒绝恶意请求和合法的高风险场景请求，而之前的单一拒绝方向编辑方法缺乏语义控制，会无差别解锁所有危险主题。

Method: 提出相互排斥解锁向量(MEUV)框架，通过多任务目标学习主题对齐的近似正交向量，包括差异消融边界、跨主题惩罚、正交性惩罚等辅助项，单轮训练即可完成。

Result: 在双语恶意提示基准测试中，MEUV在多个模型上达到不低于87%的攻击成功率，同时将跨主题泄漏减少高达90%，且中英文向量可几乎无损跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: MEUV证明了细粒度主题级能力激活的可行性，为安全敏感领域的可控LLM部署铺平了道路，且拒绝子空间具有语言无关性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

TL;DR: 提出基于离散时序图的按需调度框架，用于卫星网络中的联邦学习加速，相比传统方法减少14.20%-41.48%的训练轮次时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模低轨卫星系统支持广域数据交换和AI协同训练，但隐私约束下原始数据无法集中，联邦学习成为替代方案。然而卫星网络的动态拓扑和有限带宽会阻碍参数聚合，导致训练时间延长

Method: 提出离散时序图基础的按需调度框架，动态分配通信资源来加速联邦学习过程

Result: 仿真结果显示该方法相比传统统计复用策略显著提升性能，减少整体轮次时间14.20%-41.48%，且模型越大、客户端越多加速效果越明显

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决卫星网络中联邦学习的通信瓶颈问题，具有良好的可扩展性，特别适用于大规模模型和多客户端场景

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TripOptimizer是一个基于深度学习的可微分框架，用于从点云数据直接进行快速气动分析和形状优化，通过变分自编码器和三平面隐式神经表示实现高保真3D几何重建和阻力系数预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算流体动力学(CFD)的气动形状优化计算成本高昂，严重限制了设计空间探索，需要开发更高效的方法来减少对计算密集型CFD模拟的依赖。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)结合三平面隐式神经表示进行高保真3D几何重建，并添加阻力系数预测头。在包含8000个独特车辆几何形状和对应阻力系数的大型数据集DrivAerNet++上进行训练，学习编码气动相关几何特征的潜在表示。提出通过修改编码器参数子集来引导初始几何形状朝向目标阻力值的优化策略。

Result: 优化设计实现了高达11.8%的阻力系数降低，结果通过独立的高保真CFD模拟（超过1.5亿个网格单元）验证。隐式表示对几何缺陷具有鲁棒性，能够优化非水密网格。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更敏捷的气动形状优化工作流程，显著减少了对计算密集型CFD模拟的依赖，特别是在早期设计阶段，为气动优化提供了高效的新途径。

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个综合框架，将PINNs与MPC相结合，实现了SIR流行病模型的联合状态参数估计和最优控制，为流行病控制提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are
learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In
this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

Motivation: 现有多模态模型在推理时遇到多个模态缺失（临床常见情况）时预测准确性下降，需要提高模型在高度模态缺失情况下的灵活性。

Method: 提出PerM-MoE方法，为每个模态使用独立路由器替代传统的单一路由器，基于T1加权MRI、FLAIR、淀粉样蛋白PET和tau PET神经影像数据预测认知衰退。

Conclusion: PerM-MoE方法显著提高了多模态模型在临床现实场景中的实用性和鲁棒性，为阿尔茨海默病进展预测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

Motivation: 探索SFT和RL两阶段微调范式中性能提升的机制，挑战"SFT记忆、RL泛化"的简化观点

Method: 使用SVD分析参数矩阵，手动编辑参数并观察性能影响，分析不同训练阶段的OOD性能变化

Result: 发现OOD性能在SFT早期达到峰值后下降，RL主要恢复SFT丢失的能力而非创造新能力，奇异向量旋转是影响OOD行为的关键因素

Conclusion: 重新定义了SFT和RL在两阶段微调中的角色，发现奇异向量旋转是影响模型泛化能力的关键机制，为优化训练策略提供新见解

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于微分同胚嵌入神经算子的新框架NDNO，用于高效预测不同几何形状结构件的加工变形，解决了传统数值方法计算成本高和神经算子直接应用于变化几何域的限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构件加工变形预测对保证尺寸精度和可靠性至关重要，但传统数值方法计算成本高，特别是处理不同几何形状时。神经算子虽能高效求解偏微分方程，但直接应用于变化几何域存在理论和实践限制。

Method: 通过受平滑性和可逆性约束的微分同胚神经网络，将复杂三维几何显式映射到共同参考域，然后在参考域上训练神经算子学习残余应力引起的变形场。

Result: 该方法能够准确预测主方向和多方向变形场，在不同几何形状（包括组件类型、尺寸和特征）的零件上实现了高精度和高效率。

Conclusion: NDNO框架为变化几何形状结构件的变形预测提供了有效且计算高效的解决方案，实现了对不同几何形状的快速适应和高精度预测。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于改进关联规则挖掘方法分析滤泡性甲状腺癌临床数据，发现结节内结节模式、小梁模式、低TSH评分等新恶性关联指标，为术前诊断提供参考


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滤泡性甲状腺癌缺乏特异性超声征象，术前诊断困难，相关临床研究较少，需要新的数据分析方法来识别有助于术前诊断的临床指征

Method: 改进传统关联规则挖掘方法，结合可解释机器学习SHAP思想提出新的分析指标，对2010-2023年1673例病例数据进行回顾性分析

Result: 除了不规则边界、不均匀晕环等常见指标外，还发现结节内结节模式、小梁模式、低TSH评分等强恶性关联指标，桥本甲状腺炎组合也可能具有强恶性关联

Conclusion: 滤泡性甲状腺癌术前诊断应考虑多种临床指征，本研究发现的多样化恶性关联指标可为临床医生提供诊断参考

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during
the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to
three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a
simplified DDPM architecture with customizable input and time embeddings. Our
approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity,
clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as
Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with
dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos
complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying
embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings
improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality

<details>

Motivation: JEPA架构在视觉表示学习和基于模型的RL中应用日益广泛，但其行为机制仍缺乏理论理解，需要系统分析其表示学习特性

Method: 提出一个简单的JEPA变体，包含联合训练的辅助回归头和潜在动态模型，在确定性MDP环境中进行理论分析和实验验证

Result: 证明了"无病态表示坍塌定理"：当训练使潜在转移一致性损失和辅助回归损失趋近于零时，任何具有不同动态或辅助标签的非等价观测都会映射到不同的潜在表示

Conclusion: 辅助任务与转移动态共同编码了正确的等价关系，联合训练JEPA模型和辅助头能产生比单独训练更丰富的表示，为改进JEPA编码器指明了路径

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共形预测的训练免费、模型无关的专家延迟框架，能够在不重新训练的情况下处理专家组成变化，在CIFAR10-H和ImageNet16-H上达到99%+准确率，同时显著减少专家工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习延迟(L2D)方法对专家组成变化敏感，需要大量重新训练。需要一种无需训练、模型无关的专家延迟解决方案来提升人机协作的可靠性。

Method: 使用共形预测器生成预测集来识别标签特定不确定性，通过可分离性准则选择最具判别力的专家，该准则衡量专家区分剩余可信标签的能力。

Result: 在CIFAR10-H和ImageNet16-H上分别达到99.57±0.10%和99.40±0.52%的准确率，专家工作量减少高达11倍，在专家性能下降时保持稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界人机协作提供了可扩展、无需重新训练的L2D替代方案，在保持高性能的同时显著降低专家参与需求。

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: GraphSAGE框架具有归纳能力、可扩展性和可解释性，为金融机构利用图机器学习获取交易生态系统的可操作洞察提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal
dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach
integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural
networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures
uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent
dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent
trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context
observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over
latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and
extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic
dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto
oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK
Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and
disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs
trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed
cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up
to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with
competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the
maximum entropy model.

Conclusion: C3DE模型有效解决了长时期城市人流预测中的关键挑战，通过因果感知和动态校正机制显著提升了预测准确性

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

TL;DR: 研究发现传统单隐藏层神经网络训练中会自然产生Kolmogorov-Arnold几何结构，通过分析雅可比矩阵的外幂统计特性来量化这种几何特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络如何有机地学习为下游处理准备输入数据，并研究KA几何结构的出现规律以通过及时调整超参数来加速学习。

Method: 通过分析雅可比矩阵J(x)的外幂统计特性（零行数量和次要统计量）来量化KA几何结构，测量J(x)的尺度和轴对齐特性。

Result: 发现KA几何结构经常在训练普通单隐藏层神经网络时产生，并对其在函数复杂度和模型超参数空间中的出现位置有了初步理解。

Conclusion: 这项研究是KA-Networks（KANs）的"另一面"，不是将KA工程化到神经网络中，而是观察KA在浅层MLP中的自然涌现。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to

about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新鲜食品零售中动态定价和库存管理的挑战，平衡利润最大化和减少食品浪费的需求

Method: 使用带注意力机制的LSTM网络预测7天内的销量、价格趋势和损耗率，然后用PSO算法优化定价和补货策略，结合成本加成定价进行动态调整

Result: 该方法不仅最大化利润，还减少食品浪费，提高了决策准确性，为易腐商品行业提供可扩展解决方案

Conclusion: 该框架成功弥合了预测建模与优化之间的差距，为新鲜食品零售和其他易腐商品行业提供了有效的动态定价和库存管理解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

<details>

Motivation: 标准DeepONet使用全连接线性层在主干网络中，难以捕捉复杂PDE中固有的空间结构，需要改进空间表示能力

Method: 在DeepONet架构中引入傅里叶嵌入主干网络，利用随机傅里叶特征映射来丰富空间表示能力

Conclusion: 傅里叶嵌入能有效增强神经算子学习，为PDE代理建模提供了鲁棒且广泛适用的方法

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

Conclusion: MEAGraph为表示学习和聚类提供了有效方法，可用于数据分析、异常检测和数据集优化，解决了高维原子描述符下的采样偏差问题

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前向-前向算法扩展版本在卷积神经网络中存在表示能力有限和大规模数据集可扩展性差的问题，主要原因是通道维度爆炸。需要开发新的训练框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出自适应空间优良性编码（ASGE）框架，利用特征图计算每层的空间感知优良性表示，实现逐层监督。该方法将分类复杂度与通道维度解耦，解决了通道爆炸问题。

Conclusion: ASGE框架完全消除了反向传播，显著缩小了与BP训练模型的性能差距，为可扩展的无反向传播CNN训练奠定了可行基础。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer,
enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely eliminating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

Conclusion: 该框架支持在不确定性关键领域进行稳健的谱学习，为更广泛的贝叶斯谱机器学习奠定了基础，解决了标准贝叶斯方法因谱分解几何约束而失效的基本挑战。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

Conclusion: SRI方法通过低维表示学习有效解决了现有偏差纠正方法的局限性，显著提升了统计推断的准确性和效率。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.
We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究比较了边界元法(BEM)和物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在二维亥姆霍兹方程波散射问题中的性能，发现PINNs训练时间比BEM长42倍，但评估速度快204倍，且泛化能力较差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较BEM和PINNs两种方法在相同条件下求解亥姆霍兹方程波散射问题的性能，为波传播问题的研究方法选择提供定量依据

Method: 通过超参数优化确定PINNs配置并最小化控制方程和边界条件残差，同时采用边界离散化应用BEM，从求解精度、计算时间和泛化能力三方面评估两种方法

Result: 在相同精度下，PINNs训练时间比BEM长42倍，但评估速度快204倍；在训练域外泛化测试中，PINNs相对误差从7.46×10⁻²增加到8.22，而BEM在扩展区域保持相似误差水平

Conclusion: 该研究为波传播问题的方法选择提供了定量数据支持，指出了PINNs在训练效率和泛化能力方面的挑战，为未来研究方向奠定了基础

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基础模型与传统方法在脑科学时间序列预测和因果关系发现中的性能对比，以及是否能够在零样本设置下应用

Method: 使用基础模型在零样本和微调设置下预测fMRI时间序列，并通过比较Granger类估计与标准Granger因果性进行验证，使用逻辑映射耦合和Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程生成的合成时间序列进行验证

Result: 基础模型在零样本预测中获得竞争力（控制组MAPE 0.55，患者组MAPE 0.27），虽然标准Granger因果性没有显示明显数量差异，但基础模型提供了更精确的因果作用检测

Conclusion: 基础模型具有多用途性、强大的零样本性能和在时间序列预测与因果发现中的潜在应用价值

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal
discovery in time-series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Preference Hijacking (Phi)的新攻击方法，通过精心优化的图像可以任意操纵多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的输出偏好，生成具有偏见但难以检测的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型在各个领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益凸显。本文旨在揭示MLLMs存在的新安全风险：模型输出偏好可能被恶意图像操纵。

Method: 提出了Preference Hijacking (Phi)方法，在推理时无需修改模型，通过偏好劫持图像来操纵MLLM响应偏好。还引入了通用劫持扰动，可嵌入不同图像中实现跨图像的攻击迁移。

Result: 在各种任务上的实验结果表明，该方法能够有效劫持MLLMs的输出偏好，生成上下文相关但带有偏见的响应，且难以被检测。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了MLLMs存在严重的安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过优化图像任意操纵模型输出偏好，这对MLLMs的安全部署提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and

Conclusion: FedFD通过频域处理有效减少了联邦学习的通信负担，同时提高了模型性能，为解决数据异构性和隐私保护提供了有效方案

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

Conclusion: TimeRep通过利用TSFMs的中间层表示和有效的参考集合管理策略，为时间序列异常检测提供了更有效的解决方案，特别是在处理概念漂移方面表现出色。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型评估存在不稳定性问题，随机因素的微小变化会导致分数剧烈波动和模型排名变化，固定设置可能导致不公平比较。

Method: 提出ILR方法：为每个测试实例随机化所有影响因素(如few-shot示例)，进行多次实验并报告平均分数，而不是在整个基准测试中使用固定设置。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，ILR能减少随机因素引起的方差和不公平比较，且以不到一半的计算成本达到与先前方法相似的鲁棒性水平。

Conclusion: ILR方法有效解决了LLM评估中的不稳定性问题，提供了更公平和可靠的模型比较方式，同时具有计算效率优势。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.

Motivation: 随着神经量子态越来越多地采用基于大语言模型的组件，需要理解NQS的缩放规律，以揭示其可扩展性和最优性能-资源权衡。

Method: 通过识别基于transformer的NQS在二次量子化量子化学应用中的缩放规律，测量绝对误差和V-score作为性能指标，并进行计算约束优化分析。

Result: 发现模型大小与训练时间的关系高度依赖于损失度量和ansatz选择，与语言模型的近似线性关系不同。

Conclusion: 神经量子态的缩放规律与大语言模型存在显著差异，需要针对特定应用场景进行定制化的性能-资源优化策略。

Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM)
performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of
computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS)
has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS
scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal
performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify
scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and
V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in
second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous
compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find
that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent
on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear
relationship found for language models.

Method: 在每个节点使用假设检验（z检验、t检验、Mann-Whitney U、log-rank等）评估候选子群与补集的统计显著性差异，采用交叉验证方法处理多重检验问题，自动确定是否需要继续分裂节点。

Result: 在5个大规模UCI数据集上的实验表明，ZTree在低数据量情况下表现优异，相比CART能生成更简单的树而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: ZTree提供了一个统计基础扎实的决策树替代方案，通过假设检验和交叉验证的多重检验校正，实现了高效灵活的决策树学习框架。

Abstract: Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued
for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and
regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that
replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically
principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis
testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a
candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the
complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach
to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping
criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold
(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of
the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned
using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply
removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter
tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a
p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into
our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical
evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree
consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.
Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing
performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to
traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a
cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Soft Graph Transformer (SGT)，一种用于MIMO检测的软输入软输出神经网络架构，结合了消息传递和图感知注意力机制，在接近最大似然性能的同时保持计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最大似然检测计算复杂度过高，传统消息传递算法依赖大系统渐近性和随机矩阵假设，而现有Transformer检测器无法利用MIMO因子图结构和解码器端软信息

Method: 将消息传递直接集成到图感知注意力机制中，通过软输入嵌入支持解码器信息更新，实现有效的软输出生成

Result: 作为独立检测器，SGT接近最大似然性能，超越现有基于Transformer的方法

Conclusion: SGT成功克服了现有方法的局限性，为MIMO检测提供了一种高效且性能优异的解决方案

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural
architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity
renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing
algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics
and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical
implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to
incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side
soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability
in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT
integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and
supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design
enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational
efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and
surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 解决联邦基础模型在新用户小群体或专业场景下微调的挑战，这些场景通常数据有限，需要在个性化和联邦学习之间找到更好的平衡

Method: 采用双层个性化框架：1）客户端级使用私有数据进行个性化微调；2）服务器级使用基于客户端特定任务向量的相似用户进行个性化聚合，减少非IID数据中不相关或兴趣冲突客户的干扰

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验分析证明了所提算法的有效性

Conclusion: 该双层个性化框架能够有效解决联邦基础模型在小规模数据场景下的微调问题，实现了个性化与联邦学习的良好平衡

Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune
pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to
fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized
scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale
data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between
personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we
proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on
foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the
client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized
aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific
task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level
fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise
personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or
interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its
early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where
laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we
investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical
variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid
conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented
Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive
learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives
discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then
used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR
dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that
NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance,
particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we
assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.

Motivation: 解决图持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在无回放、类增量设置的挑战性场景下，现有方法如EWC等使用对角近似的Fisher信息矩阵存在局限性

Method: 建立基于Fisher信息矩阵诱导的弯曲参数空间的一般正则化框架，提出新的无偏在线曲率近似方法，直接估计正则化项而不需要显式计算和存储Fisher信息矩阵

Result: 在三个图数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于正则化的方法，在稳定性（保留旧知识）和可塑性（获取新知识）之间实现了优越的权衡

Conclusion: 提出的在线曲率近似方法能够更好地捕捉学习新任务时的损失景观，同时保留从先前任务中学到的知识，为图持续学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字生态系统的发展使金融部门面临不断演变的滥用和犯罪策略，传统基于规则的系统缺乏检测复杂或协调犯罪行为的适应性，需要分析参与者互动来发现可疑活动。

Method: 四步预处理框架：提取图结构、考虑数据时间性管理大节点集、检测社区、应用自动标注策略生成弱标签；然后实现三种不同的Graph Autoencoder变种来区分已知拓扑模式。

Result: 初步结果表明，这种以模式为中心、拓扑驱动的方法能有效检测复杂金融犯罪方案，为传统基于规则的检测系统提供了有前景的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过图机器学习和网络分析的结合，解决了传统金融数据集稀疏、无标签的挑战，为金融犯罪检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

TL;DR: 提出SDM激活函数，在标准softmax基础上增加相似性和距离感知，提高神经网络对协变量偏移和分布外输入的鲁棒性，并提供基于示例的可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax激活函数缺乏对相似性和训练分布距离的感知，导致在协变量偏移和分布外输入情况下鲁棒性不足，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 在softmax基础上引入相似性感知（正确预测的深度匹配）和距离到训练分布的感知，形成相似性-距离-幅度（SDM）激活函数

Result: SDM激活函数比softmax对高概率区域的协变量偏移和分布外输入更鲁棒，提供基于密集匹配的示例可解释性，并能通过分类经验CDF分区来保护选择性分类中的类别召回率

Conclusion: SDM激活函数在选择性分类中优于softmax，即使考虑后校准方法，因其提供了更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和选择性分类保护机制

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

models and libraries cause slow and long training times on large datasets. This
article introduces EmbeddedML, a training-time-optimized and mathematically
enhanced machine learning library. The speed was increased by approximately
times compared to scikit-learn without any loss in terms of accuracy in
regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression. Logistic Regression and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to
reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the
applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by
approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on
large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared
to the scikit-learn implementation. In summary, the EmbeddedML library offers
regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms
that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据任务特性选择和优化基于投影的安全RL方法提供了可操作的见解，SP-RL在适当改进后具有竞争力。

Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them
to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints
in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly
considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part
of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the
policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical
relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their
differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of
SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected
by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected
to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In
SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it
manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through
the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of
SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical
analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role
of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,
including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with
established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical
predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than
for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or
outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings
provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL
methods based on task characteristics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be

Motivation: 探索TimeCluster视觉分析技术与传统子空间系统识别方法之间的数学等价性，为时间序列分析提供理论支撑和新的应用可能性

Method: 通过数学证明展示TimeCluster的滑动窗口矩阵形成Hankel矩阵，应用PCA（通过SVD）可恢复与子空间识别相同的主方向，并在合成和真实动态信号上进行实验验证

Result: 实验证实两种嵌入方法完全一致，TimeCluster的聚类坐标与子空间识别方法重合

Conclusion: 这种等价性为时间序列分析开辟了新机遇，包括从识别状态空间进行预测、流式/在线扩展、整合外部输入以及显示污染数据中潜在趋势的鲁棒技术

Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long
multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a
low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is
mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification
(block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both
approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time
series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace
system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a
time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix
recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the
cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification
methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals
confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss
future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from
the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and
visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying
trends in corrupted data.

function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth)
models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that
is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is
approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires
regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce
Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient
calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We
show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling
and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种软梯度提升框架，在提升过程中嵌入可学习的线性特征变换，特别适用于高维数据稀缺场景，通过端到端优化提升性能并避免过拟合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维数据稀缺场景下传统梯度提升方法可能无法发现最相关输入表示的问题，通过联合学习特征变换和提升来提升性能

Method: 在每个提升迭代中训练软决策树并同时学习线性输入特征变换Q，可扩展到可微非线性变换

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上证明方法能有效提升性能，通过端到端优化特征选择/变换和提升避免过拟合

Conclusion: 该方法为高维数据稀缺场景提供了有效的解决方案，通过联合优化特征变换和提升过程实现更好的性能

Abstract: We propose a soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that
embeds a learnable linear feature transform within the boosting procedure. At
each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input
feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in
high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant
input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the
performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to
differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To
support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的评估框架，比较PPO、DPO、ORPO、KTO等LLM对齐方法在事实性、安全性、简洁性、主动性和多样性五个维度上的表现，发现不同方法在不同维度各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单一技术或特定维度，缺乏对LLM对齐方法内在权衡的整体评估，需要开发一个全面的评估框架来指导更平衡可靠的LLM开发。

Method: 使用统一的评估框架，在分布内和分布外数据集上比较PPO、DPO、ORPO、KTO等对齐方法，利用经过人工研究验证的LLM-as-Judge专用提示进行评估。

Result: DPO和KTO在事实准确性方面表现最佳，PPO和DPO在安全性方面领先，PPO在简洁性和主动性之间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了常见对齐方法的权衡关系，为开发更平衡和可靠的大型语言模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.
Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking
a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified
evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO)
across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human
studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead
in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings
provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the
development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

*Haneen Najjar,Eyal Ronen,Mahmood Sharif*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出Sy-FAR方法，通过在对抗鲁棒性优化中引入对称性概念来解决机器学习系统中的公平性问题，相比追求完美公平性更易实现且效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗鲁棒性方法通常导致不公平的鲁棒性——某些类别或群体更容易受到攻击。在现实世界的关键任务（如人脸识别）中，追求完美公平性往往不可行，因为某些类别可能高度相似。

Method: 提出Sy-FAR技术，鼓励对称性（即从类别i到j的攻击成功率与从j到i的攻击成功率相同），同时优化对抗鲁棒性。该方法基于类别相似性是对称关系的直觉。

Result: 在五个数据集、三种模型架构上进行了广泛评估，结果显示Sy-FAR相比最先进方法显著提高了公平对抗鲁棒性，运行速度更快且结果更一致。同时还能改善另一种不公平性——对抗样本容易被分类到的目标类别的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 对称性是一个更易实现且有效的公平性概念，Sy-FAR方法在提高对抗鲁棒性的同时能够有效促进公平性，特别适用于安全关键和公平性关键的机器学习系统。

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了BAPFL，这是首个专门针对原型联邦学习框架的后门攻击方法，通过原型投毒策略和触发器优化机制，在保持主任务精度的同时显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型联邦学习虽然能解决数据异构性问题，但其对后门攻击的鲁棒性尚未被充分研究。作者发现PFL对现有后门攻击具有天然抵抗力，因此需要专门设计针对PFL的攻击方法。

Method: BAPFL方法包含两个核心组件：1）原型投毒策略，通过操纵全局原型轨迹误导良性客户端的原型训练；2）触发器优化机制，为每个目标标签学习独特且隐蔽的触发器，使触发样本的原型与目标标签的全局原型对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集和PFL变体上的实验表明，BAPFL相比传统后门攻击方法，攻击成功率提高了35%-75%，同时保持了主任务精度。

Conclusion: BAPFL证明了原型联邦学习框架存在安全漏洞，该方法具有高效性、隐蔽性和适应性，为PFL系统的安全性评估提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages
mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However,
its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor
attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data
heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the
first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL
integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization
mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of
global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing
their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of
trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns
a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the
prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global
prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets
and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in
attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving
main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.

### [318] [Causal Discovery via Quantile Partial Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12981)
*Yikang Chen,Xingzhe Sun,Dehui Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于分位数部分效应(QPE)的因果发现方法，通过在观测分布中分析QPE的线性跨度特性来识别因果方向，无需考虑噪声机制或马尔可夫假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果发现方法通常需要假设噪声机制或函数形式，本文旨在直接从观测数据的形状特征不对称性中识别因果关系，提供更通用的识别条件。

Method: 利用QPE在有限线性跨度中的假设，通过基函数测试估计的QPE来区分因果方向；多变量情况下利用QPE与得分函数的联系，使用Fisher信息确定因果顺序。

Result: 在大量双变量因果发现数据集上实验证明有效；在多变量合成和真实数据集上验证了使用Fisher信息识别因果顺序的可行性。

Conclusion: QPE方法为因果发现提供了新的视角，直接从观测分布的形状特征中识别因果关系，扩展了传统功能因果模型的识别条件，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional
quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels.
Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie
in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their
observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results
based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise,
etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this
parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even
the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape
characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function
tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is
empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate
causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the
close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher
Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order
when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the
feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple
synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单有效的后训练策略来增强ECG基础模型ECGFounder的性能，在PTB-XL基准测试中显著提升了分类性能指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG基础模型虽然具有跨任务适应性，但其临床适用性受到性能限制，主要原因是缺乏有效的后训练策略

Method: 采用后训练方法增强ECGFounder模型，包括随机深度和预览线性探测等关键组件

Result: 相比基线微调策略，在macro AUROC上提升1.2%-3.3%，在macro AUPRC上提升5.3%-20.9%；使用10%训练数据时分别提升9.1%和34.9%

Conclusion: 后训练策略能有效提升ECG基础模型的性能，具有更好的稳定性和样本效率，为ECG领域基础模型的持续发展做出贡献

Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

Abstract: We present a new method to visualize data ensembles by constructing
structured probabilistic representations in latent spaces, i.e.,
lower-dimensional representations of spatial data features. Our approach
transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through
feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational
autoencoder (VAE). The resulting latent spaces follow multivariate standard
Gaussian distributions, enabling analytical computation of confidence intervals
and density estimation of the probabilistic distribution that generates the
data ensemble. Preliminary results on a weather forecasting ensemble
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量多样化图像方面表现出色，但存在训练数据记忆问题，引发隐私和安全担忧。数据遗忘技术旨在移除特定数据影响而无需完全重新训练。

Method: ReTrack采用重要性采样构建更高效的微调损失函数，通过保留主导项来近似优化目标，使去噪轨迹转向k近邻方向，实现高效遗忘同时保持生成质量。

Result: 在MNIST T-Shirt、CelebA-HQ、CIFAR-10和Stable Diffusion上的实验表明，ReTrack达到了最先进的性能，在遗忘强度和生成质量保持之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: ReTrack是一种快速有效的数据遗忘方法，能够解决扩散模型的数据记忆问题，在保持生成质量的同时实现高效的数据移除。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer
from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns.
Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of
specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and
effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs
importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we
approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable
objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest
neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality.
Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show
that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off
between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经声码器在边缘设备部署时能耗过高，而脉冲神经网络(SNN)因其事件驱动特性具有高能效优势，适合低资源场景

Method: 基于Vocos框架构建，设计Spiking ConvNeXt模块减少MAC操作，加入振幅捷径路径保持信号动态，采用自架构蒸馏策略转移知识，集成轻量级时序移位模块增强时序信息融合

Result: 性能与ANN版本相当，UTMOS得分3.74，PESQ得分3.45，能耗仅为ANN的14.7%

Conclusion: Spiking Vocos成功实现了高性能与超低能耗的平衡，为边缘设备部署神经声码器提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural
vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical
deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their
event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with
ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To
mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking
ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate
an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to
bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to
effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also
integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the
temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN
counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while
consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 通过反转推理数据构建高质量逆向推理数据集r1k，研究发现SFT在逆向数据上表现优于正向数据，但混合训练会削弱方向区分性，DPO只能部分恢复区分性但会抑制非偏好推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单向监督微调，忽略了不同推理模式之间的复杂交互作用，需要研究双向推理目标下的对齐效果。

Method: 构建逆向推理数据集r1k（通过反转s1k中的1000个正向示例），比较SFT和DPO在双向推理目标下的对齐效果。

Result: 在r1k上进行SFT比在s1k上获得1.6%-6.8%的准确率提升；混合训练会削弱方向区分性；DPO只能部分恢复区分性但会抑制非偏好推理路径。

Conclusion: 混合推理数据会引入冲突的监督信号，需要开发鲁棒且方向感知的对齐策略。

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse
mathematical expressions.

Conclusion: 粗到细课程学习是训练CFD GNN模型的有效策略，显著加速收敛并提升训练效率。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.

Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of
Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters
like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which
can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring
nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still
requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic
graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by
increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several
studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic
networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that
the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding
self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established
connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the
low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the
essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of
connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our
work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by
observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the
costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed
to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph
spectrum.

Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely
viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a
particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex,
multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70

*Alessandro Antonucci,Eric Rossetto,Ivan Duvnjak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究生成概率分类器的个体公平性，通过分析后验推理对私有特征扰动的鲁棒性，发现鲁棒性与预测准确性之间存在相关性，并提出用马尔可夫随机场解决计算复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成概率分类器中的个体公平性问题，探讨后验推理对私有特征扰动的鲁棒性，旨在理解公平性与准确性之间的关系。

Method: 使用贝叶斯网络作为基础生成模型，在14个具有公平性关注的数据集上进行实证评估。为解决贝叶斯网络中多私有特征鲁棒性分析的计算复杂度问题，将问题重新表述为辅助马尔可夫随机场中的最可能解释任务。

Result: 实验证实了鲁棒性与预测准确性之间的相关性假设，鲁棒性更强的实例更可能被准确分类。

Conclusion: 研究结果为缓解公平性与准确性之间的传统权衡提供了新的方向，表明通过关注鲁棒性可以同时改善公平性和准确性表现。

Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the
traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了希尔伯特协方差网络(HVNs)，这是一种针对无限维希尔伯特空间中信号的卷积学习框架，扩展了现有协方差神经网络(VNNs)的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该工作成功将协方差神经网络扩展到无限维希尔伯特空间，提出的HVNs框架在保持理论严谨性的同时，在实际应用中展现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

*Yunchuan Guan,Yu Liu,Ke Zhou,Zhiqi Shen,Jenq-Neng Hwang,Serge Belongie,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过建立熵限制监督设置进行公平比较，证明元学习比全类训练具有更紧的泛化边界，在有限熵下更高效且对标签噪声和异构任务更鲁棒，并提出了MINO元学习框架来提升无监督性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明全类训练策略训练的模型在少样本分类任务中可以达到与元学习相当的性能，为了证明元学习的价值，需要建立公平的比较设置。

Method: 建立熵限制监督设置进行理论分析和实验验证；提出MINO元学习框架，使用DBSCAN自适应聚类算法和动态头进行无监督任务构建，以及基于稳定性的元缩放器来抵抗标签噪声。

Result: 元学习相比全类训练具有更紧的泛化边界，在有限熵下更高效，对标签噪声和异构任务更鲁棒；MINO框架在多个无监督少样本和零样本任务中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 元学习在有限熵条件下具有优势，特别适合无监督任务；MINO框架成功利用了元学习的这些优势，在无监督场景中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRUST-FS是一个针对不完整多视图数据的无监督特征选择方法，通过张量分解框架同时处理特征选择、缺失值填补和视图权重学习，利用主观逻辑获取可信的跨视图相似性信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图无监督特征选择方法存在三个主要问题：1) 只能处理视图缺失，无法处理更一般的变量缺失情况；2) 缺失值填补和特征选择过程分离，忽略了二者的交互；3) 缺失数据导致相似性图不准确，影响特征选择性能。

Method: 提出TRUST-FS方法，采用自适应加权CP分解，在统一的张量分解框架中同时进行特征选择、缺失变量填补和视图权重学习。利用主观逻辑获取可信的跨视图相似性信息，构建可靠的相似性图来指导特征选择和填补。

Result: 综合实验结果表明，该方法在效果和性能上优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: TRUST-FS通过统一的张量分解框架和可信相似性信息学习，有效解决了不完整多视图数据特征选择中的关键挑战，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative
features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research
interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,
several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data
are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more
general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values
in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing
missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two
processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can
result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of
feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for
incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable
UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new
adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature
selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a
unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to
acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates
learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature
selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合双向时序图注意力变换器(B-TGAT)的时间分布混合U-Net自编码器，用于高维多变量时空气候数据的聚类分析，在三个不同数据集上表现出优越的聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法在处理高维多变量时空气候数据时难以同时捕捉局部和全局时序关系并保持空间上下文，需要新的方法来应对复杂的时间依赖性、演化的空间交互和非平稳动态。

Method: 采用时间分布混合U-Net自编码器架构，编码器和解码器配备ConvLSTM2D模块提取联合时空特征，通过跳跃连接保留多尺度空间细节。在瓶颈处集成B-TGAT，结合基于图的空间建模和注意力驱动的时序编码。

Result: 在三个不同的时空气候数据集上实验表明，该方法在聚类可分性、时间稳定性和与已知气候转变的对齐方面优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ConvLSTM2D、U-Net跳跃连接和B-TGAT的集成提升了时序聚类性能，同时为复杂的时空变异性提供了可解释的见解，推动了方法学发展和气候科学应用。

Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net
skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while
providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability,
advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.

TL;DR: HAM是一种新颖的分层适配器合并框架，通过动态组合不同任务的适配器来解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在多个视觉基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中新知识干扰旧知识导致的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当面对新颖数据分布时，现有参数高效微调方法在动态学习场景和长任务序列中面临扩展性挑战。

Method: 提出分层适配器合并(HAM)框架：维护固定组集来分层整合新适配器，为每个任务训练低秩适配器和重要性标量，基于适配器相似性动态分组，在组内进行适配器修剪、缩放和合并。

Result: 在三个视觉基准测试上的大量实验表明，HAM显著优于最先进的方法，特别是在任务数量增加时表现更加出色。

Conclusion: HAM框架通过动态适配器合并有效解决了持续学习中的扩展性问题，能够管理比竞争基线更多的任务，并提高了学习效率。

Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it
poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary
issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,
causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can
partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and
over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data
distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,
enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face
challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of
tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases
the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical
Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters
from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale
effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with
improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that
hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank
adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on
adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,
facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on
three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的密度感知最远点采样方法(DA-FPS)，用于在标签数据有限的情况下选择训练集，通过最小化加权填充距离来降低回归模型的预测误差上界


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习回归任务中，由于计算限制或标注成本高昂，标记训练数据往往有限。需要从无标签数据中选择合适的训练集来平衡性能与效率

Method: 推导了Lipschitz连续回归模型预测误差的上界，该上界与训练集的加权填充距离线性相关。提出了DA-FPS采样方法，通过近似最小化数据驱动的加权填充距离估计来优化该上界

Result: 在三个数据集上使用两种回归模型进行实验，结果显示DA-FPS相比其他采样策略显著降低了平均绝对预测误差

Conclusion: DA-FPS是一种有效的被动且模型无关的采样方法，仅基于数据特征表示就能选择出高质量的训练集，在有限标签数据场景下能显著提升回归模型性能

Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where
the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational
constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from
unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the
selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling
methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper
bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression
models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set,
a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We
introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling
method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven
estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our
derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three
datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean
absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOSSIL是一个统一的样本权重框架，通过单一可解释公式整合类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程、数据增强惩罚和预热动态，在数据不平衡和小样本场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决罕见疾病成像、基因组学和灾难响应等领域中数据不平衡和小样本问题，现有方法如过采样、焦点损失或元加权等方案存在脆弱性或复杂性，需要更统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出FOSSIL框架，通过样本敏感重要性学习，将类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程学习、数据增强惩罚和预热动态统一到一个可解释的公式中，无需改变模型架构。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上相比ERM、课程学习和元加权基线方法获得了一致的实证增益，并提供了基于遗憾的理论保证。

Conclusion: FOSSIL提供了一个理论上有保证且实证有效的统一框架，能够灵活处理数据不平衡和小样本学习中的多个挑战。

Abstract: Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare
disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are
scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions
such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of
this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible
Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting
framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction,
difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a
single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework
provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical
gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and
real-world datasets, while requiring no architectural changes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的联邦学习后门攻击OBA，使用OOD数据作为毒化样本和触发器，并设计了SoDa方法来增强隐蔽性。同时提出了BNGuard防御方法，利用批归一化层统计偏差检测恶意模型更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后门攻击依赖可见触发器和物理修改目标对象，攻击场景受限。需要开发更隐蔽、更实用的后门攻击方法，并设计相应的防御机制。

Method: OBA攻击使用OOD数据作为毒化样本和触发器；SoDa通过正则化恶意本地模型的幅度和方向来增强隐蔽性；BNGuard防御通过检测批归一化层统计偏差来识别恶意模型更新。

Result: OBA能有效绕过现有防御机制，在主任务上保持高精度；BNGuard在各种设置下都能有效防御SoDa攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了更隐蔽的联邦学习后门攻击方法，并设计了有效的防御机制，增强了联邦学习系统的安全性。

Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within
constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require
physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for
FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which
uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our
approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.
To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$,
which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models
during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to
evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively
circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the
main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against
$\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data
causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization
layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and
exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.
Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available
at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPO是一种单流策略优化方法，通过持久化KL自适应值跟踪器和全局优势归一化，解决了传统分组方法GRPO的退化组问题和可扩展性限制，在数学推理任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分组方法如GRPO虽然通过即时基线减少方差，但存在退化组擦除学习信号和同步障碍限制可扩展性的关键缺陷，特别是在生成长度变化的长时程或工具集成场景中。

Method: SPO采用单流设计，用持久化的KL自适应值跟踪器替代每组基线，并在整个批次中全局归一化优势，为每个样本提供稳定、低方差的学习信号，同时支持通过优先级采样实现自适应课程。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B模型上，SPO比GRPO收敛更平滑、准确率更高，在五个数学基准测试中平均maj@32提升3.4个百分点，其中BRUMO 25提升7.3pp，AIME 25提升4.4pp，HMMT 25提升3.3pp。

Conclusion: SPO的成功挑战了RL算法中添加附带复杂性的主流趋势，表明通过基本原则而非架构变通可以推动LLM推理的下一个进步浪潮，提供了更稳健高效的优化路径。

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过将重复的推理步骤转换为可重用的"行为"，减少令牌消耗和延迟，提升推理效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多步推理中重复涉及相同中间步骤，导致令牌消耗和延连l增加，并占用上下文窗口空间

Method: 通过模型的元认知分析将重复推理片段转换为简洁可重用的"行为"（名称+指令），并存储在"行为手册"中，在推理时提供给模型或通过监督微调激流到参数中

Result: 在三个不同设置下都取得了改善：1）行为条件推理：减少46%推理令牌，准确性保持或提升；2）行为引导自我改进：无需参数更新即获得10%准确性提升；3）行为条件SFT：更有效将非推理模型转换为推理模型

Conclusion: 将慢速济导转换为快速过程提示，使得大语言模型能够记住如何推理，而不仅仅是记住得出什么结论

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NoRA是首个直接调整预训练Transformer模型中非线性激活函数的参数高效微调框架，通过可学习的有理函数替换固定激活函数，仅需更新0.4%参数就能达到或超越全参数微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要调整权重矩阵而保持激活函数固定，限制了模型的适应能力。作者认为激活函数应该作为模型适应的一等公民进行优化。

Method: NoRA用可学习的有理函数替换固定激活函数，对分子和分母系数应用结构化低秩更新，采用分组设计实现局部适应并提高稳定性。NoRA++是NoRA与LoRA的组合方法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100上，NoRA仅更新0.02M参数(0.4%)就达到或超越全微调，准确率提升+0.17%和+0.27%。在LLaMA3-8B指令微调中，NoRA++平均MMLU提升+0.3%-0.8%，STEM任务提升+1.6%。

Conclusion: NoRA将适应约束在低维函数子空间中，隐式正则化更新幅度和方向，确立了激活空间调优作为权重基础PEFT的互补且高度参数高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt
weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce
\textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear
activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces
fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured
low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise
design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On
vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds
full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving
accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA
(\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets
by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++
consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of
+0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We
further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional
subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results
establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly
parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation
functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种后处理单前向传播框架SPC-UQ，通过分割点分析(SPA)联合捕捉偶然和认知不确定性，无需重新训练预训练模型，在回归和分类任务中实现了高效且准确的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法要么计算成本高（如贝叶斯或集成方法），要么只能提供部分、任务特定的估计（如单前向传播技术），需要一种既能高效计算又能全面捕捉不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用分割点分析(SPA)将预测残差分解为上下子集，计算每侧的平均绝对残差(MARs)。通过自一致性差异分数(SDS)进行细粒度认知估计。回归任务中使用分位数回归获得预测区间，分类任务中基于SPA校准softmax输出后计算预测熵。

Result: 在多种回归和分类基准测试中，该方法匹配或超越了多个最先进的不确定性量化方法，同时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SPC-UQ框架提供了一种高效、全面的不确定性量化解决方案，能够在不需要修改或重新训练预训练模型的情况下，准确捕捉偶然和认知不确定性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet
existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or
ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as
single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc
single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method
applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals
into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)
on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the
harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency
Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across
regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile
regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which
are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are
available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax
outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.
Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ
methods while incurring minimal overhead.

### [341] [JANUS: A Dual-Constraint Generative Framework for Stealthy Node Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13266)
*Jiahao Zhang,Xiaobing Pei,Zhaokun Zhong,Wenqiang Hao,Zhenghao Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了JANUS框架，通过局部特征流形对齐和全局结构语义一致性约束，解决了现有节点注入攻击方法的局部短视问题，显著提升了攻击的隐蔽性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络节点注入攻击方法主要依赖间接代理指标实现隐蔽性，缺乏对注入内容本质特征的考虑，且仅关注局部结构模仿，存在局部短视问题。

Method: 提出双约束隐蔽节点注入框架JANUS：局部层面使用特征流形对齐策略实现特征空间几何一致性；全局层面引入结构化潜变量并通过最大化互信息确保注入结构与原始图语义模式一致；将注入攻击建模为序列决策过程，使用强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的实验表明，JANUS框架在攻击有效性和隐蔽性方面均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JANUS框架通过同时考虑局部和全局结构一致性，有效解决了节点注入攻击的隐蔽性问题，为图神经网络的安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

### [342] [LLMs for energy and macronutrients estimation using only text data from 24-hour dietary recalls: a parameter-efficient fine-tuning experiment using a 10-shot prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13268)
*Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开源大语言模型通过思维链提示和参数高效微调，仅基于文本描述就能准确预测食物营养成分，为低负担的饮食监测提供了新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI营养估算工具主要依赖图像输入，但基于文本描述的大语言模型是否能准确预测营养成分尚不清楚。如果有效，这种方法可以实现无需照片的简单饮食监测。

Method: 使用NHANES青少年24小时饮食回顾数据，采用10-shot思维链提示的开源量化LLM，仅基于食物和数量的文本字符串来估算能量和五种宏量营养素。然后应用参数高效微调(PEFT)来评估预测准确性的改进。

Result: 在11,281名青少年数据中，原始LLM预测效果差（能量MAE为652.08，Lin's CCC<0.46）。经过微调的模型表现显著改善，能量MAE降至171.34-190.90，所有结果的Lin's CCC均超过0.89。

Conclusion: 通过思维链提示和PEFT微调，开源LLM仅接触文本输入就能从24小时饮食回顾中准确预测能量和宏量营养素值，这为低负担的文本基饮食监测工具带来了希望。

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional
content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can
accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of
foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable
simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used
24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM
was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and
five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their
quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate
whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the
ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber
and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,
mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean
absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across
endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,
with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC
exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a
chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed
solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values
from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,
text-based dietary monitoring tools.

Motivation: 克服人类认知限制是LLM训练的关键前沿。专有代理系统在复杂信息搜索基准上表现出超人类能力，而开源模型缺乏系统处理极端不确定性的推理模式

Method: 通过结构化采样和信息模糊化生成新颖的高不确定性任务，采用RFT冷启动和高效的代理RL训练算法DUPO（重复采样策略优化）

Result: WebSailor在复杂信息搜索任务中显著优于所有开源代理，匹配专有代理的性能，缩小了能力差距

Conclusion: 该方法成功地为开源模型注入了处理极端不确定性的关键能力，实现了与专有系统相当的性能表现

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LFCS算法主要在小型实例上评估，缺乏对算法可扩展性的深入理解，需要更大规模的基准数据集来有效评估算法性能。

Method: 采用自适应Construct, Merge, Solve, Adapt (CMSA)框架，通过基于组件的构造迭代生成有前景的子问题，并利用外部黑盒求解器进行求解。

Result: 在新引入的大规模基准测试中，自适应CMSA优于五种领先方法，在1510个已知最优解的问题实例中解决了1486个，达到99.9%的最优解质量，表现出卓越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应CMSA框架在LFCS问题上实现了最先进的性能，展示了优秀的可扩展性，并为歌曲识别等实际应用提供了新的工程贡献，同时通过可解释性分析揭示了影响算法性能的关键特征组合。

Abstract: This paper addresses the Longest Filled Common Subsequence (LFCS) problem, a
challenging NP-hard problem with applications in bioinformatics, including gene
mutation prediction and genomic data reconstruction. Existing approaches,
including exact, metaheuristic, and approximation algorithms, have primarily
been evaluated on small-sized instances, which offer limited insights into
their scalability. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark dataset with
significantly larger instances and demonstrate that existing datasets lack the
discriminative power needed to meaningfully assess algorithm performance at
scale. To solve large instances efficiently, we utilize an adaptive Construct,
Merge, Solve, Adapt (CMSA) framework that iteratively generates promising
subproblems via component-based construction and refines them using feedback
from prior iterations. Subproblems are solved using an external black-box
solver. Extensive experiments on both standard and newly introduced benchmarks
show that the proposed adaptive CMSA achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming five leading methods. Notably, on 1,510 problem instances with
known optimal solutions, our approach solves 1,486 of them -- achieving over
99.9% optimal solution quality and demonstrating exceptional scalability. We
additionally propose a novel application of LFCS for song identification from
degraded audio excerpts as an engineering contribution, using real-world
energy-profile instances from popular music. Finally, we conducted an empirical
explainability analysis to identify critical feature combinations influencing
algorithm performance, i.e., the key problem features contributing to success
or failure of the approaches across different instance types are revealed.

Method: 提出错误感知课程学习策略，按难度组织样本；设计引导思维丢弃机制，专注于挑战性案例的推理；结合GRPO训练方法，使模型能从信息丰富的样本中更有效地学习。

Result: 在MMAU-mini数据集上达到73.80%的准确率，在MMAR数据集上创下64.30%的新SOTA，显示出优秀的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose Omni-CLST, an error-aware Curriculum Learning framework with
guided Selective Chain-of-Thought for audio question answering. The framework
efficiently leverages existing high-quality dataset through two key strategies:
an error-aware curriculum that organizes samples by difficulty, and a guided
thought dropout mechanism that focuses reasoning on challenging cases.
Integrated with GRPO training, these strategies enable the model to learn more
effectively from informative samples. Experiments on MMAU-mini and MMAR
demonstrate that Omni-CLST achieves competitive accuracy (73.80% on MMAU-mini)
and establishes a new state of the art (64.30% on MMAR), highlighting its
robustness and generalization capability in multimodal audio-language

TL;DR: 提出利用标注者相似性进行语音情感识别个性化适配的方法，通过预训练模型为新标注者找到相似的历史标注者，实现低成本个性化预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音情感识别系统预测多个标注者的共识值，但无法准确预测单个标注者的标注。现有方法难以适配新标注者，因为需要大量标注数据

Method: 利用大规模标注者群体预训练模型，通过有限的新标注者注册数据识别相似的历史标注者，使用相似标注者的模型进行预测

Result: 该方法显著优于其他现成方法，为轻量级情感适配铺平道路，适合实际部署

Conclusion: 提出的基于标注者相似性的方法能够以极低成本实现语音情感识别的个性化适配，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition systems often predict a consensus value generated
from the ratings of multiple annotators. However, these models have limited
ability to predict the annotation of any one person. Alternatively, models can
learn to predict the annotations of all annotators. Adapting such models to new
annotators is difficult as new annotators must individually provide sufficient
labeled training data. We propose to leverage inter-annotator similarity by
using a model pre-trained on a large annotator population to identify a
similar, previously seen annotator. Given a new, previously unseen, annotator
and limited enrollment data, we can make predictions for a similar annotator,
enabling off-the-shelf annotation of unseen data in target datasets, providing
a mechanism for extremely low-cost personalization. We demonstrate our approach
significantly outperforms other off-the-shelf approaches, paving the way for
lightweight emotion adaptation, practical for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 传统音乐信息检索(MIR)研究的标注数据有限且缺乏多样性，Osu!社区创作的beatmap覆盖了动漫、Vocaloid、游戏音乐等 underrepresented 音乐类型，提供了大规模、多样化的潜在标注资源

Method: 开发了从Osu! beatmap提取标注的流程管道，将数据划分为有意义的子集，通过人工分析确定单一定时点或间隔≥5秒的多定时点beatmap提供可靠标注，而间隔<5秒的则需要额外筛选

Result: 研究发现单一定时点或间隔较大的多定时点beatmap标注质量可靠，同一歌曲的多个标注具有高度一致性，证明了Osu!数据作为可扩展、多样化社区驱动MIR研究资源的潜力

Conclusion: Osu!数据是MIR研究的有价值资源，研究发布了处理流程和高质量子集osu2beat2025来支持进一步探索，为音乐分析提供了新的数据来源

Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of Osu!, a community-based rhythm game, as
an alternative source of beat and downbeat annotations. Osu! beatmaps are
created and refined by a large, diverse community and span underrepresented
genres such as anime, Vocaloid, and video game music. We introduce a pipeline
for extracting annotations from Osu! beatmaps and partition them into
meaningful subsets. Through manual analysis, we find that beatmaps with a
single timing point or widely spaced multiple timing points (>=5 seconds apart)
provide reliable annotations, while closely spaced timing points (<5 seconds
apart) often require additional curation. We also observe high consistency
across multiple annotations of the same song. This study demonstrates the
potential of Osu! data as a scalable, diverse, and community-driven resource
for MIR research. We release our pipeline and a high-quality subset

Abstract: Existing multi-timbre transcription models struggle with generalization
beyond pre-trained instruments and rigid source-count constraints. We address
these limitations with a lightweight deep clustering solution featuring: 1) a
timbre-agnostic backbone achieving state-of-the-art performance with only half
the parameters of comparable models, and 2) a novel associative memory
mechanism that mimics human auditory cognition to dynamically encode unseen

enables adaptive polyphonic separation with minimal training data (12.5
minutes), supported by a new synthetic dataset method offering cost-effective,
high-precision multi-timbre generation. Experiments show the timbre-agnostic
transcription model outperforms existing models on public benchmarks, while the
separation module demonstrates promising timbre discrimination. This work
provides an efficient framework for timbre-related music transcription and
explores new directions for timbre-aware separation through cognitive-inspired

Abstract: Recent developments in voice cloning and talking head generation demonstrate
impressive capabilities in synthesizing natural speech and realistic lip
synchronization. Current methods typically require and are trained on large
scale datasets and computationally intensive processes using clean studio
recorded inputs that is infeasible in noisy or low resource environments. In
this paper, we introduce a new modular pipeline comprising Tortoise text to
speech. It is a transformer based latent diffusion model that can perform high
fidelity zero shot voice cloning given only a few training samples. We use a
lightweight generative adversarial network architecture for robust real time
lip synchronization. The solution will contribute to many essential tasks
concerning less reliance on massive pre training generation of emotionally
expressive speech and lip synchronization in noisy and unconstrained scenarios.
The modular structure of the pipeline allows an easy extension for future multi
modal and text guided voice modulation and it could be used in real world
systems.

Motivation: 异常声音检测通常需要机器属性标签进行分类训练，但收集这些标签既费力又不切实际。为了解决属性标签缺失的问题，需要开发不依赖完整标签的方法。

Method: 使用域自适应预训练模型提取特征表示，采用凝聚层次聚类方法分配伪属性标签，然后通过监督微调进行模型适应，实现机器属性分类。

Result: 在DCASE 2025挑战数据集上的评估显示，该方法带来了显著的性能提升，最终超越了之前在挑战中排名第一的系统。

Conclusion: 提出的层次聚类伪标签分配方法有效解决了属性标签缺失问题，结合预训练模型和微调策略，在异常声音检测任务中取得了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) is often formulated as a machine attribute
classification task, a strategy necessitated by the common scenario where only
normal data is available for training. However, the exhaustive collection of
machine attribute labels is laborious and impractical. To address the challenge
of missing attribute labels, this paper proposes an agglomerative hierarchical
clustering method for the assignment of pseudo-attribute labels using
representations derived from a domain-adaptive pre-trained model, which are
expected to capture machine attribute characteristics. We then apply model
adaptation to this pre-trained model through supervised fine-tuning for machine
attribute classification, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance.
Evaluation on the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events
(DCASE) 2025 Challenge dataset demonstrates that our proposed approach yields
significant performance gains, ultimately outperforming our previous
top-ranking system in the challenge.

Abstract: Real-world speech communication is often hampered by a variety of distortions
that degrade quality and intelligibility. While many speech enhancement
algorithms target specific degradations like noise or reverberation, they often
fall short in realistic scenarios where multiple distortions co-exist and
interact. To spur research in this area, we introduce the Speech Restoration
Challenge as part of the China Computer Federation (CCF) Advanced Audio
Technology Competition (AATC) 2025. This challenge focuses on restoring speech
signals affected by a composite of three degradation types: (1) complex
acoustic degradations including non-stationary noise and reverberation; (2)
signal-chain artifacts such as those from MP3 compression; and (3) secondary
artifacts introduced by other pre-processing enhancement models. We describe
the challenge's background, the design of the task, the comprehensive dataset
creation methodology, and the detailed evaluation protocol, which assesses both
objective performance and model complexity. Homepage: https://ccf-aatc.org.cn/.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-talker automatic speech recognition (MTASR) faces
significant challenges in accurately transcribing overlapping speech,
especially under high-overlap conditions. To address these challenges, we
proposed Global-Local Aware Dynamic (GLAD) Mixture-of-Experts, which
dynamically fuse speaker-aware global information and fine-grained local
features to guide expert selection. This mechanism enables speaker-specific
routing by leveraging both global context and local acoustic cues. Experiments
on LibriSpeechMix show that GLAD outperforms existing MTASR approaches,
particularly in challenging multi-talker scenarios. To our best knowledge, this
is the first work to apply Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to end-to-end MTASR with a
global-local fusion strategy. Our code and train dataset can be found at

Abstract: Speech therapy plays a critical role in training speech disorders caused by
neurological impairments such as stroke. However, traditional manual and
computer-assisted systems are limited in real-time accessibility and
articulatory motion feedback, constraining their practical utility. Recent
advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in healthcare, particularly through their ability to
integrate multimodal data for adaptive assessment and therapeutic feedback.
Nevertheless, challenges including insufficient acquisition and fusion of
articulatory information, inadequate parsing of articulatory organ motion
trajectories, and the scarcity of high-quality domain-specific datasets hinder
the application of MLLMs in speech therapy. To address these limitations, we
propose an MLLM-based speech rehabilitation assistance system that
synergistically leverages ultrasound tongue imaging and speech signals to
deliver precise, interactive articulatory feedback. We construct a high-quality
domain-specific dataset comprising UTI-speech dialogue pairs. This dataset
facilitates fine-tuning to enhance the model's clinical adaptability. Building
on this dataset, our methods achieves spatiotemporal fusion training strategy
of ultrasound videos and speech signals, enabling fine-grained articulatory
impairment analysis and ultimately generating actionable feedback.

Abstract: Recently, Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have progressed rapidly,
demonstrating their strong efficacy in universal audio understanding through
cross-modal integration. To evaluate the LALM's audio understanding
performance, researchers have proposed different benchmarks. However, key
aspects for real-world interactions are underexplored in existing benchmarks,
i.e., audio signals typically contain both speech and non-speech components,
and energy levels of these components can vary significantly across different
scenarios. Moreover, most benchmarks do not consider the joint understanding of
speech, scene, and events within the same audio clip. In this work, we
introduce SSEU-Bench, the first versatile audio understanding benchmark that
explicitly accounts for energy differences between speech and non-speech audio,
with both independent and joint understanding settings for speech, scene, and
events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that some LALMs tend to underperform on
certain tasks in a joint understanding setting. To address this issue, we
introduce Chain-of-Thought, which effectively improves the LALM's joint audio
understanding performance by decomposing complex tasks into simpler reasoning
steps

Abstract: Efficiently retrieving specific instrument timbres from audio mixtures
remains a challenge in digital music production. This paper introduces a
contrastive learning framework for musical instrument retrieval, enabling
direct querying of instrument databases using a single model for both single-
and multi-instrument sounds. We propose techniques to generate realistic
positive/negative pairs of sounds for virtual musical instruments, such as
samplers and synthesizers, addressing limitations in common audio data
augmentation methods.
  The first experiment focuses on instrument retrieval from a dataset of 3,884
instruments, using single-instrument audio as input. Contrastive approaches are
competitive with previous works based on classification pre-training. The
second experiment considers multi-instrument retrieval with a mixture of
instruments as audio input. In this case, the proposed contrastive framework
outperforms related works, achieving 81.7\% top-1 and 95.7\% top-5 accuracies
for three-instrument mixtures.
