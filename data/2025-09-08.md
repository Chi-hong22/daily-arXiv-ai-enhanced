### [1] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过驾驶模拟器实验研究自动驾驶风险感知，发现车辆运动和皮电导可用于对象性风险评估，而面部表情识别效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动驾驶车的风险感知对公众接受度的重要影响，希望找到对象的风险评估方法。

Method: 使用32名参与者进行驾驶模拟器实验，测量主观舒适度、车辆运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率和眼动跟踪。比较两种驾驶风格咈行人交互的影响。

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强不舒适感，行人交互加剧了风险感知。面部表情识别不可靠，而使用车辆运动和皮电导的神经网络模型能够准确预测风险感知。

Conclusion: 车辆运动和皮电导指标可以作为对象的自动驾驶风险评估方法，减少主观偏差，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个通用的提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练思维链重写器，显著提升文本到图像生成模型对复杂提示词的理解和生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时存在属性绑定、否定和组合关系等方面的困难，导致用户意图与生成结果不匹配

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练思维链重写器，使用专门的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，基于24个关键点的系统分类法优化提示词重写

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在广泛的语义和组合挑战中显著提高了图像-文本对齐度

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不修改预训练模型权重的情况下提升任何T2I模型的性能，并引入了新的人类偏好基准来促进未来研究

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，通过架构改进、大规模预训练和创新的渐进式双任务强化策略，在图像生成和编辑方面达到SOTA性能，并扩展到统一的多模态框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源多模态模型过于注重参数规模而忽视训练策略优化，限制了效率和性能。需要开发更高效的训练方法来提升模型能力。

Method: 基于SD3.5-Medium进行架构修改，大规模高质量数据预训练，提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)，最后通过连接器与Qwen2.5-VL-7B联合训练构建统一多模态模型。

Result: 模型在图像生成和编辑方面超越了参数更大的BAGEL(7B)和Flux-Kontext(12B)，验证了不同任务强化阶段的相互增益和无负面干扰。

Conclusion: 提出的训练范式Skywork UniPic 2.0具有有效性和通用性，能够构建集成理解、生成和编辑的统一多模态模型，在多样化任务中实现顶级性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于像素空间双向变形和图像修复的拖拽式图像编辑框架，实现了实时变形预览和高效修复，显著提升了交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拖拽式图像编辑方法主要依赖生成模型的潜在空间操作，导致精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定约束，需要更直接的像素级编辑方案。

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向变形和图像修复，将图像区域视为可变形材料，通过弹性物体变形原理实现自然形状保持。

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现实时变形预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)，相比需要数分钟编辑的现有方法显著提升交互体验，并可作为通用适配器兼容任何修复模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持实时性能的同时实现了优异的视觉质量和精确控制，为拖拽式图像编辑提供了高效通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是首个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用'再生与修正'策略，通过扩散模型重新生成整个图像来消除对抗性补丁攻击，无需先验知识即可有效防御多种攻击类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的物体检测器仍然容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，这些攻击可以隐藏真实物体或创建虚假物体，造成严重后果。现有防御方法缺乏通用性和对自适应攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用扩散模型的生成能力重新生成整个图像，使其与良性数据对齐，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗性区域为重新生成的良性对应部分。该方法不依赖于攻击先验知识。

Result: 在多种检测器和攻击场景下，DISPATCH始终优于最先进的防御方法，在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的mAP.5分数，在非目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低至24.8%。

Conclusion: DISPATCH是一种实用可靠的物体检测系统防御方法，具有攻击无关性、通用性强和对自适应攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [6] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个统一的框架，通过解析性航向角分解和世界模型启发的相机轨迹集成机制，解决了单目视频中全局人体运动重建的深度模糊和相机-人体运动纠缠问题，在端到端轨迹重建中达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频进行全局人体运动重建在VR、图形和机器人应用中需求日益增长，但面临深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠的挑战。现有以人体运动为中心的方法在利用相机方向信息和整合相机平移线索方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了WATCH框架，包含：1）解析性航向角分解技术，相比现有几何方法具有更好的效率和可扩展性；2）受世界模型启发的相机轨迹集成机制，提供利用相机平移信息的有效途径。

Result: 在野外基准测试中，WATCH在端到端轨迹重建方面达到了最先进的性能，证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决相机平移集成这一长期挑战提供了新的见解，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

### [7] [Sali4Vid: Saliency-Aware Video Reweighting and Adaptive Caption Retrieval for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04602)
*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个简单有效的显著性感知框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索来解决密集视频字幕任务中的两个关键问题，在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端密集视频字幕模型存在两个局限性：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，而将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：显著性感知视频重加权（将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重）和基于语义的自适应字幕检索（通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索）。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了联合改进视频加权和检索对密集视频字幕的益处。

Conclusion: Sali4Vid框架通过显著性感知的视频处理和自适应检索机制，有效解决了现有密集视频字幕方法的局限性，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于无人机的交通监控系统，通过多尺度模板匹配和卡尔曼滤波实现车辆检测跟踪，准确率达91.8%，并能自动识别交通违法行为，支持多维度城市交通分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通监控系统存在覆盖范围有限、适应性差和可扩展性不足的问题，需要开发更先进的解决方案来应对城市交通拥堵和违规行为挑战。

Method: 利用无人机从200米高空采集视频数据，采用多尺度多角度模板匹配、卡尔曼滤波和单应性标定技术，结合地理围栏、运动滤波和轨迹偏差分析来检测交通违规。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了良好的可扩展性、准确性和实用价值，有望成为下一代智慧城市中执法感知、基础设施独立的交通监控解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

*Gehui Chen,Guan'an Wang,Xiaowen Huang,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2替代线性映射器，显著提升了视频到音频生成的训练效率和性能，仅需16%的训练量就能达到竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法训练成本高，需要利用基础模型的跨模态知识转移能力。受先前轻量级映射器方法的启发，希望进一步改进特征融合和映射效果。

Method: 提出多基础模型映射器(MFM-Mapper)：1)融合双视觉编码器的语义和时序特征；2)用GPT-2替代线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务；3)保持训练高效性。

Result: 仅需先前映射器方法16%的训练规模，就能在语义和时序一致性方面获得更好性能，与更大规模训练的模型竞争。

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper通过改进特征融合和映射机制，实现了高效的视频到音频生成，为资源受限环境下的跨模态生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

### [10] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个新颖的视觉骨干网络，结合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和多向Mamba SSM的全局建模能力，在ImageNet-1K和ADE20K任务上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT和SSM在全局上下文建模方面表现出色，但缺乏CNN对细粒度局部特征的捕捉能力；CNN虽有强大的局部特征归纳偏置，但缺乏全局推理能力。需要融合两者的优势。

Method: 采用卷积主干和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段使用多向Mamba块建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度。

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K达到82.6% top-1准确率，比PlainMamba-L3高0.3%且参数减少37%；在ADE20K获得47.1 mIoU，比EfficientFormer-L7高2.0 mIoU且参数减少62%。

Conclusion: VCMamba成功融合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的特征表示能力，为视觉任务提供了高效的骨干网络解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构确保语义分割结果严格遵循复杂文本标注指南，在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中语义分割不仅需要准确掩码，还必须严格遵循复杂的文本标注指南。传统方法需要昂贵的任务特定重训练，而现有开放词汇方法难以处理段落长度的复杂指南

Method: 多智能体训练免费框架，协调通用视觉语言模型：Worker执行分割，Supervisor根据检索到的指南进行批判，轻量级强化学习停止策略决定循环终止时机

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上显著优于最先进基线方法，展现出强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理复杂标注指南，在保证分割质量的同时严格遵循文本规范，且无需重新训练，具有良好的实用价值

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为开发自适应计算机化暴露疗法系统，需要能够根据患者反应动态调整视觉刺激，因此研究计算机视觉模型能否准确预测蜘蛛图像引发的恐惧水平

Method: 采用三种不同的预训练计算机视觉模型，通过迁移学习对313张标准化蜘蛛图像数据集进行训练，预测0-100尺度的恐惧评分，使用交叉验证评估性能

Result: 模型平均绝对误差在10.1到11.0之间，学习曲线分析显示减少数据集大小会显著降低性能，可解释性评估确认模型基于蜘蛛相关特征进行预测，类别错误分析识别出高误差的视觉条件

Conclusion: 研究证明了可解释计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧评分方面的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和足够数据集大小对于开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Motivation: 不同车辆平台配置不同的治意会导致点云分布偏移，使得在一种配置上训练的模型在另一种配置上性能下降，而现有研究多聚焦于环境域跨越和单一治意内的密度变化，对不同治意配置间的域跨越问题研究较少

Method: 提出两种技术：1）下游微调（在多数据集训练后进行数据集特定的微调）；2）部分层微调（仅更新部分层来改善跨配置的沿用性）。使用在同一地理区域收集的多种治意配置的配对数据集进行验证

Result: 联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调的方法，在每种配置上都一质地超过了简单的联合训练方法

Conclusion: 该研究为3D物体检测模型适应多样化车辆平台提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，有效解决了不同治意配置间的域跨越问题

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

*Tianxiang Xue,Jiayi Zhao,Jingsheng Li,Changlu Chen,Kun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间模型的混合模型CD-Mamba，用于遮蓝远感图像中的云盒检测，同时抓取短程空间关联和长程大气相似性，提高检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远感图像常被云层遮蓝，影响数据完整性和可靠性。有效的云盒检测需要同时处理短程空间冗余和长程大气相似性。

Method: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，统一集成卷积操作和Mamba状态空间模型，同时抓取像素级细节和片段级长期依赖关系。

Result: 大量实验验证了CD-Mamba的有效性，在多样化空间尺度上显示出更优的检测准确性，性能超过现有方法。

Conclusion: CD-Mamba通过统一卷积和Mamba模型，成功地同时处理了云盒检测中的短程空间关联和长程依赖关系，为遮蓝远感图像的云盒检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出Task Consistency Training (TCT)框架解决医学图像分割中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，通过一致性约束和过滤策略有效利用未标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中获取全类别标注困难，现有方法使用部分标注数据集存在类别不平衡问题，且伪标签生成方法需要额外模型并可能引入标签噪声。

Method: TCT框架包含主分割头和多个辅助任务头，通过一致性约束利用未标注解剖结构，采用过滤策略排除低一致性噪声数据，使用统一辅助不确定性加权损失防止特定任务主导。

Result: 在8个腹部数据集上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TCT框架能够有效解决类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，在多样化临床数据上表现优异。

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种不确定性感知方法来增强SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下的分割鲁棒性，通过多步微调和UAT适配器改进自动驾驶场景的分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化能力，而自动驾驶等安全关键应用需要更可靠的分割结果

Method: 1）为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2）将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器（UAT）适配到驾驶场景

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明，UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，而具有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在多样化驾驶场景中表现更佳

Conclusion: 明确的不确定性建模对于在挑战性环境中进行安全关键自动驾驶具有重要价值，不确定性感知方法能显著提升分割模型在恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity

environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component
of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce
a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet是一个用于飓风后损害评估的多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定的注意力机制，在RescueNet数据集上达到91.75%的mAP，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且难以区分视觉相似或共现的损害类型，需要更准确的飓风后损害评估方法。

Method: 使用Res2Net分层骨干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文，结合多头类别特定残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度，平衡局部细节和全局上下文。

Result: 在4,494张UAV图像数据集上，MCANet达到91.75% mAP，优于ResNet、Res2Net等基准模型。使用8个注意力头时性能进一步提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。

Conclusion: MCANet能够准确定位损害相关区域，支持可解释性，可用于灾后风险制图、应急路由等应用。未来可整合灾害知识图谱和多模态大语言模型提升适应性。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种动态视频中人群检测方法，通过统合局部外观特征和全局场景上下文，以及时间一致性优化，能够检测动态变化的人群结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测复杂人群需要考虑不仅是局部外视特征，还需要全局场景上下文。但以前的方法假设人群在视频中不变，无法处理动态变化的情况。

Method: 使用组织检测增强的视觉-语言模型(VLM)提取每帧的局部和全局特征，然后通过图论法对所有帧的组织概率进行全局优化，以保持时间一致性。

Result: 在公开数据集上，该方法表现超过了现有的最先进组织检测方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉-语言模型特征提取和全局时间优化，该方法能够有效检测视频中动态变化的人群结构。

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

TL;DR: FloodVision是一个零样本洪水深度估计框架，结合GPT-4o的视觉语言能力和结构化知识图谱，通过识别参考物体、检索真实高度、估计淹没比例来实现准确的洪水深度测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法在洪水检测中存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，需要依赖固定的物体检测器和特定任务训练。

Method: 结合基础视觉语言模型GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，检索验证高度，估计淹没比例，并应用统计异常值过滤计算最终深度值。

Result: 在110张MyCoast New York众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差为8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线降低20.5%，优于之前的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在不同场景下泛化良好，近乎实时运行，适合未来集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，用于智慧城市洪水韧性建设。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Motivation: 解决文本-视频检索任务中双塔框架效果差、单塔框架效率低的问题，希望同时实现高效果和高效率。

Method: 提出PIG方法，包含伪查询生成器为每个视频生成伪查询，使视频特征和文本特征在细粒度层面交互，在推理阶段不增加额外计算开销。

Result: 在五个常用基准测试上R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与双塔模型相当，性能接近最先进水平。

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了双塔和单塔框架的优势，实现了效果和效率的双重提升，为文本-视频检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Motivation: 针对MRI图像在切片维度空间分辨率低的问题，需要开发高效的超分辨率方法来提升图像质量，同时保持边缘锐度和纹理细节。

Method: 使用MLP-Mixers与卷积层结合的单维度SRGAN架构，在MSSEG2数据集上训练，并在多个临床数据集上进行验证。

Result: MLP-SRGAN相比现有方法能产生更锐利的边缘、更少的模糊，保留更多纹理和精细解剖细节，且参数更少、训练/评估更快、模型更小。

Conclusion: MLP-SRGAN是一种高效的单维度超分辨率方法，在MRI图像质量提升方面优于现有技术，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D

of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable
benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight
graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood
grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with
reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,
Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a

TL;DR: 本文提出使用混合专家模型(MoE)从计算机视觉模型中提取准确且校准良好的预测不确定性估计，无需架构修改，相比集成方法在OOD数据下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用如交通场景感知中，需要准确且校准良好的预测不确定性估计来增强模型可靠性。集成方法虽然常用但效率较低，而MoE提供了一种高效替代方案。

Method: 研究三种从MoE中提取预测不确定性估计的方法：预测熵、互信息和专家方差。使用A2D2数据集训练具有两个专家的MoE模型，并评估路由不确定性（通过门熵计算）。

Result: MoE比集成方法在OOD数据下产生更可靠的不确定性估计。简单门控机制比复杂类别门控产生更好的路由不确定性校准。增加专家数量可进一步提升不确定性校准效果。

Conclusion: MoE是提取良好校准预测不确定性估计的有效方法，无需架构修改，在不确定性校准方面优于传统集成方法，特别是在安全关键应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合Mamba-Transformer框架LFMT，通过子空间简单扫描策略和双阶段建模策略，在低计算复杂度下显著提升了光场图像超分辨率的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多方向扫描策略在处理复杂光场数据时存在效率低下和冗余特征提取的问题，同时状态空间在保保空间-角度和视差信息方面有限制。

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)来提高特征提取效率；采用双阶段建模策略：阶段I使用空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块(SA-RSMB)进行浅层特征提取，阶段II使用双分支平行结构组合极线平面Mamba块(EPMB)和极线平面Transformer块(EPTB)进行深层极线特征精炼。

Result: 实验结果显示LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上都显著超过了当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的大幅提升。

Conclusion: LFMT框架成功结合了Mamba和Transformer模型的优势，能够在空间、角度和极线平面域进行全面的信息探索，为光场图像超分辨率提供了一种高效且效果显著的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

TL;DR: PropVG是一个端到端的基于proposal的视觉定位框架，首次无缝整合前景目标proposal生成和参考目标理解，无需额外检测器，通过对比学习和多粒度判别提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端视觉定位方法仅依赖参考目标监督，忽略了潜在前景目标的益处，且缺乏多粒度判别能力，在复杂场景中目标识别不够鲁棒。

Method: 提出PropVG框架，包含对比参考评分(CRS)模块（句子和词汇级别对比学习）和多粒度目标判别(MTD)模块（融合对象和语义级信息）。

Result: 在gRefCOCO、Ref-ZOM、R-RefCOCO和RefCOCO等多个基准测试上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: PropVG成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过整合proposal生成和目标理解，结合对比学习和多粒度判别，显著提升了视觉定位性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

TL;DR: TemporalFlowViz是一个针对超燃冲压发动机燃烧模拟的视觉分析系统，使用Vision Transformer提取特征，通过降维和聚类发现潜在燃烧模式，并结合专家标注和视觉语言模型生成自然语言摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超燃冲压发动机燃烧模拟产生的大规模高维时间流场数据对可视化解释、特征区分和跨案例比较提出了重大挑战，需要专门的分析工具来支持专家理解复杂的燃烧动力学。

Method: 使用预训练的Vision Transformer从时间序列流场图像中提取高维嵌入，应用降维和基于密度的聚类发现潜在燃烧模式，构建时间轨迹跟踪模拟演化，结合专家标注和视觉语言模型生成自然语言摘要。

Result: 通过两个专家案例研究和专家反馈证明，TemporalFlowViz能够增强假设生成、支持可解释模式发现，并促进大规模超燃冲压发动机燃烧分析中的知识发现。

Conclusion: TemporalFlowViz提供了一个有效的参数感知视觉分析工作流，成功弥合了潜在表示与专家推理之间的差距，为复杂燃烧动力学的理解提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无需姿态信息的3D定量相位成像框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了对流动细胞群的高通量断层成像，支持任意几何形状和多轴旋转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D定量相位成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转且需要已知每个帧的姿态，这限制了方法对近球形细胞的适用性，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，只能分析细胞群的子集。

Method: 利用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，通过联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，在弱散射假设下实现3D折射率分布重建。

Result: OmniFHT能够从稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖中实现准确重建，仅需10个视图或120度角度范围即可获得高保真结果。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了对整个流动细胞群的原位高通量断层成像，为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏的无标记形态计量分析解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS是一种基于语义高斯泼溅的移动重建方法，通过粗粒度语义分割和颜色过滤来快速隔离感兴趣对象，减少约25%的训练时间，同时保持高质量的新视角合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动自主空中机器人需要快速准确的3D重建，特别是在遥指导和灾难响应等关键应用中。传统方法重建整个场景效率低下，而专注于特定感兴趣对象(PoIs)可以显著提高效率。

Method: 首先使用语义高斯泼溅生成粗粒度可分割场景，然后通过新颖的基于颜色的有效过滤方法对语义对象进行精细化处理，实现有效的对象隔离。

Result: 在两个数据集(SCRREAM真实室外场景和NeRDS 360合成室内场景)上评估，显示运行时间减少，新视角合成质量提高，训练时间比完整语义高斯泼溅训练周期减少约四分之一。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法成功平衡了高质量重建和减少训练时间的需求，为移动机器人应用提供了高效的语义3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前列腺癌冷冻消融治疗的手术前规划依赖专家经验，过程耗时且存在治疗质量差异，限制了该技术的可扩展性。需要自动化方法来提高规划的准确性和效率。

Method: 将冷冻消融规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用强化学习框架在模拟环境中顺序选择冷冻消融针位置和冰球直径，通过基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数学习最优策略。

Result: 在583例回顾性前列腺癌病例中，Cryo-RL相比基于几何优化的最佳自动化基线方法，Dice系数提高了8个百分点以上，达到了人类专家水平，同时规划时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，展示了该技术在医疗规划应用中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和3D模拟渲染引擎，为不同的锈贱条件生成合成数据

Result: 使用合成数据训练的模型在实际锈贱工业物体图像上达到了0.87 mAP50的高分，超过其他方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成高质量的合成数据，但且具有可自定义性，可扩展到其他工业老化检测场景

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

Motivation: 手动计数皮脊细胞内液滴耗时且主观，需要自动化解决方案来提高计数效率和对象性

Method: 使用Nile Red染色皮脊细胞图像，分为14个液滴计数类别，通过数据增广扩展到约50,000个细胞。比较了两种模型：基线MLP模型和注意力机制MIL模型

Result: 基线MLP模型表现更稳定（平均MAE=5.6），注意力MIL模型不稳定（平均MAE=10.7）但在某些折叠中表现更优

Conclusion: 简单的袋级聚合方法提供了健壮的基线，注意力MIL需要任务对齐的池化和正则化才能充分发挥潜力

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务具有高度不适定性，传统方法基于模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值往往导致严重失真，需要利用参考图像提供更强的先验信息。

Method: 构建检索和增强系统，使用多模态大语言模型选择合适参考图像；引入具有多级隔离层的即插即用适配器模块动态生成目标视图的参考特征；设计解耦三重注意力机制有效对齐和整合多分支特征。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，结合创新的适配器模块和注意力机制，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

Motivation: 现有IVIF方法假设高质量输入，难以处理双源退化场景，需要手动选择多个预增强步骤，导致误差累积和性能下降

Method: 设计GFMSE模块进行频域退化感知和抑制，提取融合相关子带特征；GSMAF模块在空间域进行跨模态退化过滤和自适应多源特征聚合

Result: 在双源退化场景下，GD^2Fusion相比现有算法和策略实现了更优的融合性能

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题，通过双域联合优化和VLM退化感知实现了性能提升

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest

models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical

Conclusion: SLVM模型通过生物受灵的设计有效提升了低光照交通场景中的视觉感知性能，同时降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

scratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and
ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will
explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset feature analysis, data
augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: LUIVITON是一个端到端的全自动虚拟试穿系统，能够将复杂的多层服装穿戴到多样化的人形角色上，支持快速服装尺寸定制和材质属性调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决复杂服装与任意多样化体型对齐的挑战，需要开发一个能够处理复杂几何、非流形网格，并能泛化到各种人形角色的自动化虚拟试穿系统。

Method: 使用SMPL作为代理表示，将服装到身体的穿戴问题分解为两个对应任务：1）服装到SMPL的几何学习对应预测；2）基于扩散模型的身体到SMPL对应，利用多视角一致的外观特征和预训练的2D基础模型。

Result: 系统能够处理复杂几何形状，有效泛化到各种人形角色（包括人类、机器人、卡通角色、生物和外星人），并保持计算效率，无需人工干预即可生成高质量的3D服装拟合。

Conclusion: LUIVITON提供了一个完全自动化的虚拟试穿解决方案，即使在没有2D服装缝制图案的情况下也能工作，支持服装尺寸和材质的快速定制调整。

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

TL;DR: ADClick是一个用于工业异常检测的交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注，显著提升异常检测模型性能。ADClick-Seg进一步通过跨模态框架结合视觉特征和文本提示，在多项指标上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业产品检测通常仅使用正常样本训练异常检测模型，虽然可以收集缺陷样本但需要像素级标注，限制了可扩展性。需要一种能够高效生成精确标注的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出ADClick交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和简短文本描述生成像素级异常标注。进一步开发ADClick-Seg跨模态框架，通过基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示，结合像素级先验和语言引导线索。

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%的优异性能。ADClick-Seg在具有挑战性的多类别异常检测任务上取得AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: ADClick和ADClick-Seg通过交互式分割和跨模态融合，有效解决了工业异常检测中标注成本高的问题，显著提升了检测性能，为实际工业应用提供了高效的标注解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感方法估计不可靠。需要更鲁棒的几何约束来改进高斯溅射优化。

Method: 提出基于主曲率初始化高斯尺度；引入高效且抗噪声的几何结构估计方法；构建包含一阶和二阶几何量的通用优化框架。

Result: 在多个数据集上的新颖视图合成实验中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯溅射性能，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: GeoSplat通过整合高阶几何先验和鲁棒估计方法，为高斯溅射提供了有效的几何约束优化框架，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的混合深度学习模型SIT，通过结合CNN的特征提取能力和Transformer的关系建模能力，在人脸美学预测任务上创造了新的最高水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CNN模型在图像美学评价中因固定尺度处理而忽略不同级别特征间关联性的问题。

Method: 设计了多尺度模块提取不同感矩野的面部特征，然后通过Transformer编码器的自注意力机制显式建模这些多尺度表征间的交互关系。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上达到现有最高水平，Pearson相关系数为0.9187，超过了之前的所有方法。

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索间的交互作用对高性能的面部美孩预测至关重要，混合CNN-Transformer模型在需要全局上下文理解的复杂图像回归任务中具有广阔潜力。

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

TL;DR: 使用稀疏混合专家(MoE)层增强CNN对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，通过在深层阶段插入单个MoE层，结合对抗训练，在PGD和AutoPGD攻击下实现鲁棒性提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN对抗攻击的鲁棒性增强方法通常需要资源密集型对策，探索通过MoE层在不增加推理成本的情况下提高模型容量和鲁棒性

Method: 在ResNet架构的深层阶段替换选定的残差块或卷积层为MoE层，结合对抗训练，使用switch loss进行专家平衡

Result: 在CIFAR-100上训练的ResNet中，插入单个MoE层能持续提升PGD和AutoPGD攻击下的鲁棒性，但switch loss导致路由崩溃到少数过度使用的专家上

Conclusion: MoE层能有效提升模型鲁棒性，路由崩溃现象反而使某些专家路径更加鲁棒，表明鲁棒子路径通过专业化出现

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中源数据无法共享（隐私或计算成本限制）且目标标签稀缺的挑战，特别是在神经科学等连续值输出的回归任务中

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发了CRAFT方法，用于源无关的半监督预训练模型迁移，不需要中间表示对齐

Result: 在EEG眼动预测和MRI脑年龄预测两个神经科学数据集上，CRAFT在标签稀缺时比微调模型RMSE提升9%，比四种最先进的源无关域适应方法提升3%以上

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的回归任务的高效源无关半监督深度迁移方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: SGS-3D是一个训练无关的3D实例分割细化方法，通过"先分割后生长"框架，利用几何基元净化模糊的2D-3D提升掩码，然后生长成完整实例，显著提升分割精度。

Conclusion: SGS-3D通过语义和几何信息的有效协同，实现了高保真度的3D实例分割，无需训练即可作为现有方法的细化模块，在多种场景下表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 手语识别面临标注数据稀缺的问题，而现有的对比学习方法存在两个主要问题：1) 对所有视频区域同等对待，忽视了关键信息区域的重要性；2) 不同手语之间的共享动作导致负样本相似度过高，难以区分。这些问题导致学习到的特征缺乏判别性，在下游任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一个自监督学习框架，包含两个关键组件：1) 使用自由负样本对的新自监督方法；2) 新的数据增强技术。这两个组件协同工作，能够更好地学习手语的有意义表示。

Result: 该方法在多个评估设置下都显示出显著优势，包括线性评估、半监督学习以及不同手语之间的迁移能力，相比多种对比学习和自监督方法获得了相当大的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解决对比学习在手语识别中的特定问题，成功学习了更具判别性的特征表示，为手语识别任务提供了有效的自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态基础提供了精确且可解释的视角，通过RL与可验证奖励的方法可以有效提升LLM在SVG生成任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in

COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual

rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to

Method: 采用滑动窗口机制确保窗口内帧间的充分信息交换，使用紧凑相机表示并维护全局相机令牌池来提升相机位姿估计的可靠性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了WinT3R在在线重建质量、相机位姿估计和重建速度方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: WinT3R通过创新的滑动窗口机制和相机表示方法，成功解决了重建质量与实时性能之间的权衡问题，为在线三维重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online
prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous
methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time
performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism
that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,
thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large
computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and
maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at

### [54] [The Ethical Compass of the Machine: Evaluating Large Language Models for Decision Support in Construction Project Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04505)
*Somtochukwu Azie,Yiping Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过定量和定性方法评估大语言模型在建筑项目管理中的伦理决策可靠性，发现LLMs在处理情境细节和负责任方面存在显著缺陷，建议作为人类监督的决策支持工具使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在建筑项目管理这种高风险、伦理敏感的决策环境中的伦理可靠性和可靠性。

Method: 采用混合方法研究设计：定量方面使用新的伦理决策支持评估检查表(EDSAC)测试两个领先LLMs在12个实际伦理场景中的表现；定性方面通过半结构化访谈收集12位行业专家的专业观点。

Result: LLMs在法律遵循等结构化领域表现谨慰，但在处理情境细节、确保负责任和提供透明推理方面存在显著缺陷。相关方对AI自主进行伦理判断表示明显担忧，强烈建议强化人类监督。

Conclusion: LLMs目前最佳定位是作为决策支持辅助工具，而非自主的伦理代理。论文提供了可操作的建议和可复制的EDSAC框架。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

*Wenxiao Wang,Priyatham Kattakinda,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来提升智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置而固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和配置的全面优化方法。

Method: Maestro框架在明确的rollout/token预算约束下，联合搜索智能体的图结构（模块和信息流）和节点配置（模型、提示词、工具、控制参数），并利用轨迹中的反思性文本反馈来优先处理编辑。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均分别超过MIPROv2、GEPA和GEPA+Merge 12%、4.9%和4.86%；即使在仅提示优化限制下，仍领先9.65%、2.37%和2.41%，且使用比GEPA少得多的rollouts。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决仅提示调优无法修复的结构性故障模式，在面试官和RAG智能体等应用中显示出巨大优势。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇位置论文提出通过层次脚手架和语言驱动的世界模型来解决复杂多代理任务的挑战，利用大语言模型动态生成层次脚手架，提高样本效率和策略性行为学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型和代理模型的发展逐渐遍平，但精细的明确世界模型仍是关键瓶颈，尤其在复杂长期多代理任务中。标准强化学习在高保真但结构平坦的模拟器中常因搞索空间过大和奖励稀疏而失败。

Method: 提出通过层次脚手架构建明确的层次化世界模型，利用大语言模型动态生成这个层次脚手架。这种语言驱动的世界模型提供内在课程、密集有意义的学习信号和组合学习框架。

Result: 通过对2024年多代理足球研究的系统性回顾，发现了一个明确的趋势：符号和层次方法与多代理强化学习的整合，这些方法隐式或明确地构建任务基世界模型来指导代理学习。

Conclusion: 通过构建具有明确、语言可配置任务层的环境，可以桥接低级反应式行为和高级策略团队配合之间的差距，创建一个强大且可一般化的框架来训练下一代智能代理。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

*Philippe J. Giabbanelli,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个分步框架，通过混合方法设计识别不同健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，指导LLM生成定制化的健康模拟解释，以解决现有通用摘要无法满足多样化需求的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于代理的建模等仿真方法在健康决策支持中潜力巨大，但由于模型复杂性导致利益相关者难以使用。虽然LLM可以将模拟输出转化为文本，但现有方法依赖通用摘要，无法满足临床医生、政策制定者、患者等不同群体的信息需求和风格偏好。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：首先获取不同健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，然后通过可控属性调优等方法优化LLM生成定制化输出的能力，最后通过综合评估指标进行评价和改进。

Result: 提出了一个系统性的分步框架，能够指导LLM为不同健康利益相关者生成定制化的模拟解释，解决了通用摘要无法满足多样化需求的问题。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了系统性理解利益相关者解释需求的空白，通过定制化的LLM输出使复杂的健康模拟模型对各类利益相关者更加可访问和有用。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI指标无法全面抓取AI模型的细致能力，需要通过人类评估标准提升模型行为的可解释性和应用性

Method: 基于Perception Test和OpenEQA指标，进行深度访谈和大规模调查，识别关键认知技能，并将发现整合到指标设计中

Result: 发现人们认为AI缺乏解释性和共情能力，但对AI表现持有高期望，通过整合人类认知过程提出了更人类对齐的评测框架

Conclusion: 用户中心的评估对AI发展至关重要，本研究为实现AI能力与人类认知过程对齐提供了可操作的指南，改善了当前的指标实践并为未来AI模型评估的发展奠定基础

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心理理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标并提供针对性反馈，在多智能体环境中有效促进亲社会行为，相比现有大语言模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中智能体在追求独立目标时难以确定何时以及如何协助他人的问题，促进亲社会行为的发展。

Method: 使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标分布，然后通过最大化期望效用来选择上下文敏感的反馈信息。

Result: 在Doors、Keys、Gems和Overcooked环境中，ProToM相比基线方法实现了更高的成功率、更短的任务完成时间，并获得人类用户的一致偏好。

Conclusion: ProToM能够提供针对性强且有用的反馈，有效促进多智能体系统中的亲社会行为，而现有大语言模型在提供上下文接地和时机恰当的反馈方面存在不足。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WiA-LLM是一个新范式，通过整合假设分析(WIA)和强化学习，让大语言模型具备主动思考能力，能够在复杂动态环境中预测未来状态变化，在王者荣耀游戏中达到74.2%的状态变化预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型只能被动处理信息，缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，无法在行动前预测潜在后果，这限制了它们在动态高风险场景中的实用性。

Method: 整合假设分析(WIA)方法，通过改变输入变量评估假设场景，利用强化学习的环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态而不仅仅是响应当前条件。

Result: 在王者荣耀复杂游戏环境中验证，WiA-LLM在预测游戏状态变化方面达到74.2%的准确率（比基线提升高达两倍），在高难度场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索和整合假设分析能力到大语言模型的工作，代表了向主动推理的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

TL;DR: TalkToAgent是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过5个专门化LLM智能体提供交互式自然语言解释，解决RL策略可解释性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XRL方法存在解释结果可理解性有限、工具覆盖孤立的问题，导致用户难以选择合适工具理解复杂RL策略，需要更透明、交互式的解释方法。

Method: 提出包含Coordinator、Explainer、Coder、Evaluator、Debugger五个专门化LLM智能体的多智能体框架，能够自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，提供关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释。

Result: 在四水箱过程控制问题上验证，TalkToAgent成功以高准确率映射用户查询到XRL任务，coder-debugger交互最小化反事实生成失败，定性评估确认能有效解释智能体行为。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架通过多智能体LLM协作，显著提升了RL策略的可解释性和用户理解，为复杂RL系统提供了有效的自然语言解释解决方案。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Conclusion: 这是首次系统性描述语言模型长期合作行为的研究，为人工智能在更复杂混合人机社会环境中的作用研究奠定基础

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Conclusion: 分析了系统的不足之处并对prompt进行了精炼，提出了设计经验和未来研究方向，包括大规模模拟和自动化评估。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中专家智能体之间深度协作的语言交互瓶颈问题，现有工作在智能体选择和结果聚合方面有进展，但高效的语言交互仍是关键瓶颈

Method: 引入协作知识模型(CKM)，使每个智能体能够动态感知协作伙伴的认知状态，通过实时认知差距分析自适应调整通信行为（内容焦点、细节层次、表达风格）

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准测试中，OSC显著提高了任务性能和通信效率，将"并行工作的个体"转变为"深度协作的认知团队"

Conclusion: 该框架不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型作为对话代理时的可控性挑战，确保可预测和用户个性化的响应，提高对话AI的透明度

Method: 使用语言描述符将定性对话特征转化为定量定义，在描述逻辑中形式化并构建本体，通过微调指导LLM进行受控文本生成

Result: 实验结果表明该方法提供了一致且可解释的熟练度定义，改善了对话AI的透明度

Conclusion: 基于本体的方法能够有效实现LLM对话的可控性，为定性对话特征提供形式化定义和一致性检查框架

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

Motivation: 随着AI代理技术的发展，需要建立机器原生生态系统（Web of Agents），但缺乏全局透明的代理交互网络，使用信号分散且私有，无法进行有效排名

Method: 提出DOVIS五层操作协议（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义）收集最小化隐私保护的使用和性能聚合数据，并实现AgentRank-UC算法，结合使用频率和胜任力（结果质量、成本、安全性、延迟）进行统一排名

Conclusion: DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法为实现规模化、可信的代理网络提供了可行的技术方案，解决了代理生态系统中的排名协调问题

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样，忽视了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。需要一种能够有效利用历史尝试信息的方法来提高推理效率。

Method: 提出Sticker-TTS框架，使用三个协作的LRM模型进行迭代式探索和精炼解决方案。核心是提炼关键条件（称为sticker）来驱动关键信息的提取、精炼和跨轮次重用。采用两阶段优化策略，结合模仿学习和自改进来实现渐进式精炼。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了sticker引导的历史经验利用的有效性，为大型推理模型的测试时扩展提供了新的高效方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

TL;DR: Q-SafeML是一种针对量子机器学习的安全监控方法，通过量子中心距离度量来检测概念漂移，提高系统透明度和安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于量子计算与经典计算的根本差异，现有的经典ML安全监控方法无法直接应用于QML，而QML领域缺乏专门的安全机制

Method: 基于SafeML方法，采用量子中心距离度量来评估模型准确性，进行模型依赖的后分类评估，检测操作数据与训练数据之间的距离

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上的实验表明，该方法能够实现知情的人类监督，增强系统透明度和安全性

Conclusion: Q-SafeML为量子机器学习提供了专门的安全监控解决方案，适应了量子系统的独特表示约束和概率性输出特性

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估表征相似性度量方法区分能力的定量框架，通过三种互补的分离度量指标，系统比较了不同相似性度量在区分不同模型家族方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表征相似性度量是神经科学和AI领域的基础工具，但缺乏对不同度量方法在不同模型家族间区分能力的系统比较。

Method: 使用信号检测理论的dprime、轮廓系数和ROC-AUC三种分离度量指标，评估包括RSA、线性预测性、Procrustes和软匹配等常用相似性度量的区分能力，涵盖CNN、Vision Transformer、Swin Transformer、ConvNeXt等架构以及监督和自监督训练机制。

Result: 随着度量方法施加更严格的配准约束，分离性系统性增强。在基于映射的方法中，软匹配获得最高分离性，其次是Procrustes配准和线性预测性。非拟合方法如RSA也能在不同家族间产生强分离性。

Conclusion: 研究首次通过分离性视角系统比较了相似性度量，阐明了它们的相对敏感性，为大规模模型和大脑比较中的度量选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: 该框架为从行为数据推断生物学习规则提供了灵活方法，有助于指导实验训练协议和行为数字双胞式开发

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

Result: 在静态和持续环境中都表现出显著的性能提升，实证证据证明了多样化DQN仲裁控制的有效性

Conclusion: 提出了一个受人类大脑启发的框架，使强化学习智能体能够实现持续学习

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

<details>

Motivation: 许多任务领域的进步来自于对先前解决方案的重复修订，但传统RL方法需要固定最大迭代深度，成本高且任意性强

Method: ExIt通过选择性采样训练过程中遇到的最有信息量的中间部分历史作为新的自我迭代任务实例，训练自我改进策略，可结合显式探索机制维持任务多样性

Result: 在数学竞赛、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域，ExIt策略能够产生在保留任务实例上表现出强推理时自我改进能力的策略，并能在超出训练时平均迭代深度的步数预算内迭代提升性能

Conclusion: ExIt方法有效解决了自我改进任务中的迭代深度限制问题，实现了超越训练时迭代深度的推理时自我改进能力

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

Motivation: 传统的学习方法需要从先验分布中抽取大量训练样本，当先验维度高或要求高精度时，数据收集成本很高。需要一种更高效的方法来减少样本需求。

Method: 设计了一种动态分配采样努力的方法，根据具体测试实例迭代精炼训练数据集。通过条件于最新预测结果来适配逆映射几何结构，为每个测试实例量身定制数据集。

Conclusion: 该自适应采样策略具有广泛的适用性，可以轻松扩展到其他逆问题，为传统的固定数据集训练模式提供了一种可扩展且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Motivation: 现有ADMET预测方法主要依赖单任务学习，无法充分利用任务间的互补性，且计算资源消耗大。需要开发能够有效整合多任务信息的高效框架。

Method: 基于Chemprop-RDKit骨干网络，引入量子化学描述符丰富分子表示，采用结合数据集规模先验和可学习参数的指数任务加权方案实现动态损失平衡。

Result: 在13个TDC分类基准测试中，QW-MTL在12个任务上显著优于单任务基线，实现了高预测性能和快速推理。

Conclusion: 量子信息增强的特征和自适应任务加权的多任务分子学习具有有效性和高效性，为ADMET预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

TL;DR: 该论文将分割共形预测扩展到函数空间，建立了无限维设置下神经算子的不确定性量化方法，提供有限样本覆盖保证，并通过分辨率分解和回归校正实现了跨分辨率的校准转移。


<details>

Motivation: 神经算子在无限维设置中的不确定性量化缺乏有限样本覆盖保证，现有方法需要强分布假设或产生保守覆盖，需要一种能够处理函数值输出的共形预测方法。

Method: 采用两步法：首先在有限维空间建立覆盖保证，然后通过渐近收敛提升到函数空间；分解共形半径为离散化、校准和误设分量；提出回归校正方法实现跨分辨率校准转移。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法在分辨率变化下保持校准覆盖且变化较小，在超分辨率任务中实现更好的覆盖性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将共形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供了有效的有限样本不确定性量化框架，并通过诊断指标量化自回归设置中的预测退化。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Motivation: 研究转导共形预测方法中同时预测多个数据点时，置信度要求与预测集效率之间的根本性权衡关系。

Method: 推导严格的有限样本边界，分析预测集大小随样本数量和条件熵的增长规律，并在理想化设置下证明该边界的可达性。

Result: 发现任何非平凡置信度水平都会导致预测集大小呈指数增长，增长指数与样本数量线性相关且与条件熵成正比，边界还包含二阶分散项。

Conclusion: 转导共形预测存在置信度-效率权衡的根本限制，在测试数据点共享相同标签的特殊情况下，问题可简化为基于经验统计的假设检验问题，并提供了渐近最优的置信预测器。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

Motivation: 尽管注意力机制在Transformer模型中起核心作用，但其数学基础以及与特征多义性、叠加和模型性能的关系仍不清楚，需要更好的理论理解

Method: 在固定多项回归设置中优化潜在特征，分析最优解与注意力块诱导动态的一致性

Result: 发现Transformer中表示演化可解释为恢复分类最优特征的轨迹，注意力机制动态与多项回归最优特征对齐

Conclusion: 注意力机制可理解为在特征空间中寻找分类最优表示的过程，为理解Transformer内部工作机制提供了新的理论视角

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Motivation: 作者想解决传统DP-SCO研究中对Lipschitz常数的依赖问题，而实际问题中梯度可能有界矩但Lipschitz常数极大或无界。

Method: 采用Tsybakov噪声条件(TNC)和梯度的k阶矩限制，提出了(ε, δ)-DP算法，并进行了理论分析和下界证明。

Result: 得到了不依赖Lipschitz常数的上界赋界，当隐私预算足够小时甚至可以处理非Lipschitz函数，并证明了下界与上界匹配。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了DP-SCO的理论框架，能够处理更广泛的损失函数类，为实际应用提供了更强的基础。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁现象是气候系统、生态系统、金融市场等复杂系统中韧性降低的标志性特征，可能预示着难以预测的关键状态转变，但深度学习在此领域的应用潜力尚未被探索

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，在由简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练

Result: 模型能够准确识别闪烁模式，尽管在简化动态上训练，但能泛化到各种随机系统，并在实证数据（如睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代理数据）中可靠检测闪烁

Conclusion: 深度学习能够从噪声非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别广泛动态系统中的不稳定性提供了灵活框架

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

Conclusion: KRaft成功解决了传统地图融合方法的局限性，提供了一个完整的学习框架，能够有效融合地理空间数据库而不引入不一致性。

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

Motivation: 传统AGC系统容易受到隐蔽网络攻击（如FDIA）的威胁，现有方法多为黑盒模型缺乏可解释性，无法有效应对系统非线性特性

Method: 使用KAN网络离线学习AGC测量值之间的复杂非线性关系，训练后可提取符号公式，提供比传统机器学习模型更好的可解释性

Conclusion: KAN为AGC系统提供了一种准确且可解释的网络安全检测方法，能有效防御隐蔽网络攻击，增强电力系统稳定性

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

TL;DR: 论文提出了自然频谱融合(NSF)方法，将优化器视为频谱控制器，通过p指数扩展和循环调度动态平衡高低频信息，改善频谱覆盖和跨频带融合，提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究广泛讨论了机器学习中的频谱行为，但优化器自身的频谱偏好仍不明确。作者认为一阶优化器具有内在的频率偏好，这会显著重塑优化路径。

Method: 提出NSF方法：将优化器视为频谱控制器，通过p指数扩展第二矩项（支持正负指数）和循环调度，动态平衡高低频信息，周期性重新加权频率带。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明：自适应方法强调低频信息，SGD接近中性，负指数放大高频信息。循环调度拓宽频谱覆盖，改善跨频带融合，诱导早期决策边界对齐。在多个基准测试中，p指数循环调度持续降低测试误差，在某些任务上仅用四分之一训练成本即可达到基线精度。

Conclusion: NSF揭示了优化器作为主动频谱控制器的作用，为一阶优化提供了统一、可控且高效的框架。

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

Motivation: 现有自回归预训练模型的主流解码策略（如束搜索）缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，难以平衡搜索效率与多样化轨迹需求，特别是在需要长尾序列的真实应用中。

Method: 提出CoVeR方法，在保形预测框架内构建无模型解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界。

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地实现至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平。

Conclusion: CoVeR为解决解码策略的覆盖保证问题提供了理论可靠且实用的解决方案，特别适用于需要多样化长尾序列的真实应用场景。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

Conclusion: 选择适当的散度和相似性核对表示学习优化至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

Motivation: 现有的Transformer模型（如CATS）虽然高效，但可能忽略了经典统计模型（如VARMA）能够捕捉的细粒度局部时间依赖性。需要将经典统计洞察与现代深度学习框架相结合。

Method: 提出VARMAformer架构，包含两个关键创新：1）VARMA启发的特征提取器（VFE），在补丁级别显式建模自回归和移动平均模式；2）VARMA增强注意力机制（VE-atten），使用时序门使查询更具上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作验证了将经典统计洞察集成到现代深度学习框架中对时间序列预测的显著益处，能够同时捕捉全局长期依赖性和局部统计结构。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵值同时受类别相似性和分布偏差影响，难以区分两者的独立贡献，需要方法分解误差来源

Method: 使用迭代比例拟合的双随机归一化方法，这是行和列归一化的泛化，能够恢复类别相似性的底层结构

Result: 该方法能够分解误差来源，支持更精准的模型行为诊断和针对性改进，并在模型的内部类别表示空间中提供几何解释

Conclusion: 双随机归一化为混淆矩阵分析提供了新的视角，能够有效区分类别混淆和分布偏差，提升模型诊断的准确性

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: NeuSA是一种基于谱方法的物理信息神经网络，通过谱基投影和神经ODE集成来解决传统PINNs在复杂初值问题中的收敛困难、因果性违反和频谱偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP-based PINNs在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致解违反因果性并存在低频频谱偏差。需要新的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: NeuSA学习PDE在谱基上的投影，获得动力学的有限维表示，然后通过适应的神经ODE进行积分。利用谱表示的高频分量克服频谱偏差，继承NODE的因果结构，并基于经典方法的初始化方案在目标解附近开始训练。

Result: 在线性和非线性波动方程的基准测试中，NeuSA相比其他架构表现出更强的性能，具有更快的收敛速度、改进的时间一致性和更高的预测精度。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE，成功解决了传统PINNs的关键问题，为复杂PDE求解提供了有效的神经网络框架。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法在真实场景中遇到稳定性问题，当测试数据遇到混合分布移移、小批次大小或在线不平衡标签分布时，TTA可能失效或者对模型性能产生负面影响。

Method: 1) 提出SAR方法：通过删除部分噪声样本和鼓励模型权重进入平坦最小值来稳定TTA。 2) 提出SAR²方法：在SAR基础上添加两个正则化器，减少特征相关性和减少分类偏见。

Result: 方法在多种野外测试场景下表现出更好的稳定性和计算效率，超过了现有方法。

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了TTA在实际部署中遇到的稳定性挑战，为处理混合分布移移、小批次和不平衡标签分布提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPINO是一个多物理神经算子，通过超网络和混合监督实现参数化PDE的零样本泛化，无需任务特定微调，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)需要针对每个PDE问题单独训练的问题，开发一个能够零样本泛化到各类参数化PDE的统一框架。

Method: 结合Swin Transformer超网络和混合监督：使用MMS生成的解析解作为标签数据，以及物理信息目标优化的无标签样本。模型将PDE参数映射到目标PINNs，并引入迭代精化程序生成集成解。

Result: 在7个PINN文献基准问题上实现强零样本精度，优于U-Nets、Poseidon和PINO。迭代精化在6个基准上实现100倍L2损失提升，初始化PINNs收敛更快且误差更低。

Conclusion: HyPINO展示了作为扩展神经算子解决复杂非线性高维PDE问题的基础潜力，显著提高精度并降低计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

*Davide Pirovano,Federico Milanesio,Michele Caselle,Piero Fariselli,Matteo Osella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 细粒度标签训练并不总能提升分类性能，其效果取决于数据几何结构、标签层次关系、数据集大小和模型容量等因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多数据集中的类标签具有层次结构，虽然分类任务通常定义在特定层级，但训练时可以使用更细粒度的标签。经验证据表明细粒度训练可能提升性能，但需要系统研究其普适性和根本原因

Method: 使用真实和合成数据集，分析数据几何结构、标签层次关系与细粒度训练效果之间的关系，并考察数据集大小和模型容量的影响

Result: 细粒度标签训练并非普遍有效，其效果高度依赖于数据几何结构与标签层次的关系。当细粒度标签能更好地反映数据的内在结构时才能带来性能提升

Conclusion: 细粒度训练策略的有效性是有条件的，需要根据具体的数据特征和任务要求来选择是否使用细粒度标签，不能盲目应用

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在自适应对手存在下的分布类别可学习性问题，证明了针对自适应对手的可学习性比针对非自适应对手的可学习性条件更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习理论主要关注非自适应（oblivious）对手，但现实世界中对手往往能够拦截学习者请求的样本并基于完整信息进行操纵，这种自适应对手更具威胁性。

Method: 提出了一个针对自适应对手的可学习性通用概念，考虑了对手的预算限制，并通过理论分析比较了自适应和非自适应对手下的学习条件。

Result: 研究发现，针对加性自适应对手的可学习性是一个比针对加性非自适应对手的可学习性更严格的条件。

Conclusion: 自适应对手的存在显著增加了学习任务的难度，需要开发新的学习算法和理论框架来应对这种更强大的对抗性攻击。

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

TL;DR: 通过关注引导的层适应性复合token压缩方法，在保持精度的同时大幅减少KV缓存占用，且完全兼容现有推理引擎


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长上下文推理中KV缓存占用线性增长的性能瓶颈问题，而现有压缩方法或太缝性、或破坏张量布局、或需专门计算内核

Method: 使用关注引导的层适应性复合token压缩框架：通过聚合关注分数估计token重要性，独立选择头特定的token，对齐成复合token以遵循统一缓存结构，并通过全局分配机制适应性分配各层保留预算

Result: 实现了显著的内存减少，同时保持了准确性，一致超过了之前的结构化和半结构化方法

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，在保持与标准推理流程完全兼容的前提下，为高效长上下文LLM部署提供了实用可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种细粒度剪裁的轻量级1D CNN模型，在保按检测性能的前提下将模型大小和计算需求减少50%，从而提高电脑电图狂狂检测的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生物医学信号处理中显示出潜力，但具有计算资源需求大的挑战，特别是在实时检测或资源有限的环境中。需要开发更高效、更可靠的狂狂检测模型。

Method: 使用结构化剪裁技术，根据卷积内核对模型预测的重要性移除50%的内核。结合轻度提早停止技术来防止过拟合。

Result: 在剪裁50%权重和内存后，模型仍保持预测能力，准确度从92.78%提升到92.87%，macro-F1分数从0.8686提高到0.8707。

Conclusion: 结构化剪裁能够移除模型冗余性，改善普适性能力，结合轻度提早停止技术可以为资源有限环境下的狂狂检测提供一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 现代强化学习算法普遍假设后继度量具有低秩结构，但本文发现这种假设并不成立。作者旨在揭示真正的低秩结构存在于移位后的后继度量中，并为此提供理论分析和实用指导。

Method: 提出移位后继度量的概念，证明其低秩特性；推导Type II Poincaré不等式来量化谱可恢复性；建立移位量与系统局部混合性质的联系；通过实验验证理论发现。

Result: 证明了移位后继度量具有低秩结构，提供了有限样本下的估计误差界，发现所需移位量通常很小且与系统高阶奇异值衰减相关，实验显示移位能显著提升目标条件RL性能。

Conclusion: 移位操作能有效揭示后继度量的低秩结构，Type II Poincaré不等式为分析提供了有力工具，该方法在实践中有良好应用前景，特别是在目标条件强化学习任务中。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

Abstract: This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to
large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to
data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication,
computation, and memory. We propose FedSub, an efficient subspace algorithm for
federated learning on heterogeneous data. Specifically, FedSub utilizes
subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and

Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADMM在分布式优化中应用广泛，但存在收敛慢、对超参数敏感等问题

Method: 将ADMM迭代表示为图神经网消息传递，通过展开固定迭代次数进行端到端训练，学习适应性步长和通信权重

Result: 数值实验证明学习版ADMM在收敛速度和解决方案质量上均明显优于标准ADMM

Conclusion: 通过GNN学习ADMM超参数的方法有效提升了算法性能，同时保持了收敛性质

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于深度强化学习的个性化效用调优框架(DRL-PUT)，通过在线学习自动优化广告推荐系统的多目标排序函数，相比人工调优显著提升点击率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工调优方法存在调优目标不明确、参数组合过多、缺乏个性化和季节性适应能力等问题，导致次优结果。需要一种自动化的多目标优化方法来平衡平台、广告主和用户的价值。

Method: 将问题构建为强化学习任务：根据广告请求状态预测最优超参数以最大化预定义奖励；开发直接学习最优策略模型的方法，利用在线服务日志学习，避免估计价值函数。

Result: 在Pinterest广告推荐系统的在线A/B测试中，相比基线人工调优方法，DRL-PUT在测试段上使点击率提升9.7%，长点击率提升7.7%。

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架有效解决了广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，通过强化学习实现了个性化效用调优，显著提升了推荐效果。

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

*Yi-Chun Chen,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种轻量级流水线，能够将短文本叙事提示转换为基于2D瓦片的游戏场景序列，通过LLM生成叙事、提取空间谓词、检索视觉资源并生成分层地形来实现故事驱动的场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在故事生成方面取得了进展，但将叙事文本连接到可玩的视觉环境仍然是程序化内容生成中的一个开放挑战。

Method: 系统首先识别三个关键时间帧，提取"对象-关系-对象"三元组形式的空间谓词，使用GameTileNet数据集的affordance-aware语义嵌入检索视觉资源，通过细胞自动机生成分层地形，并基于谓词结构放置对象。

Result: 在十个不同故事中评估了系统性能，分析了瓦片-对象匹配、affordance层对齐和跨帧空间约束满足情况。

Conclusion: 该原型为叙事驱动的场景生成提供了可扩展的方法，为未来在多帧连续性、符号跟踪和故事中心PCG中的多智能体协调方面的工作奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models(LLMs) enable compelling story
generation, but connecting narrative text to playable visual environments
remains an open challenge in procedural content generation(PCG). We present a
lightweight pipeline that transforms short narrative prompts into a sequence of
2D tile-based game scenes, reflecting the temporal structure of stories. Given
an LLM-generated narrative, our system identifies three key time frames,
extracts spatial predicates in the form of "Object-Relation-Object" triples,
and retrieves visual assets using affordance-aware semantic embeddings from the
GameTileNet dataset. A layered terrain is generated using Cellular Automata,
and objects are placed using spatial rules grounded in the predicate structure.
We evaluated our system in ten diverse stories, analyzing tile-object matching,
affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames.
This prototype offers a scalable approach to narrative-driven scene generation
and lays the foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity, symbolic
tracking, and multi-agent coordination in story-centered PCG.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理模型相位恢复与文本引导扩散模型的即插即用框架，用于消除ptychographic成像中的伪影，通过ADMM算法确保数据保真度和伪影去除的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ptychographic相位恢复技术虽然能实现高分辨率成像，但经常受到网格病理学和多层串扰等伪影的影响，导致重建图像质量下降。

Method: 采用交替方向乘子法(ADMM)将基于物理模型的相位恢复与文本引导扩散图像编辑(LEDITS++)相结合，使用预训练的基础扩散模型，允许用户通过自然语言指定要移除的伪影。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据集上的演示显示，该方法在伪影抑制和结构保真度方面有显著改进，通过PSNR和衍射图案一致性等指标验证。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了文本引导生成模型与基于模型的相位恢复算法相结合，可作为高质量衍射成像的可迁移且保真度保持的方法。

Abstract: Ptychographic phase retrieval enables high-resolution imaging of complex
samples but often suffers from artifacts such as grid pathology and multislice
crosstalk, which degrade reconstructed images. We propose a plug-and-play (PnP)
framework that integrates physics model-based phase retrieval with text-guided
image editing using foundational diffusion models. By employing the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM), our approach ensures consensus between
data fidelity and artifact removal subproblems, maintaining physics consistency
while enhancing image quality. Artifact removal is achieved using a text-guided
diffusion image editing method (LEDITS++) with a pre-trained foundational
diffusion model, allowing users to specify artifacts for removal in natural
language. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets show
significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity,
validated by metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and diffraction
pattern consistency. This work highlights the combination of text-guided
generative models and model-based phase retrieval algorithms as a transferable
and fidelity-preserving method for high-quality diffraction imaging.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的文本驱动3D场景风格化方法，通过参考注意力机制、多深度图增强视角一致性，以及多区域风格控制，显著提升了3D风格化的质量和视角一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动3D场景编辑和风格化方法在保证高质量风格化和视角一致性方面仍存在挑战，特别是如何在不同视角和区域间保持风格一致性和语义对应。

Method: 1) 扩展风格对齐的深度条件视角生成框架，用参考注意力机制替代完全共享注意力；2) 使用多深度图网格增强视角一致性；3) 提出多区域重要性加权切片Wasserstein距离损失，支持基于分割掩码的区域风格控制。

Result: 实验评估显示，该方法在定性和定量上都有效提升了文本驱动3D风格化的效果，实现了更好的风格一致性和视角一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的技术能够同时保证高质量的3D风格化和视角一致性，并提供可选的多区域风格控制功能，为文本驱动的3D场景编辑提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which
leverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated
promising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality
stylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style
consistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic
correspondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we
introduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while
maintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style
transfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D
representation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views.
Therefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized
multi-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned
depth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared
attention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism,
which effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally,
inspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth
maps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among
stylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced
Wasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image
regions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that
this optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables
the mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene.
Experimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that
our pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能体复杂度增加，需要设计有效环境来塑造其行为和能力，特别是针对生物神经网络（神经类器官）这一新型智能体

Conclusion: 该框架为研究生物神经网络的学习机制（如LTP和LTD）提供了新途径，通过虚拟环境和自动化协议设计实现了对神经类器官智能体的有效训练和评估

Abstract: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments
that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a
critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle
to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural
organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual
environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the
underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and
long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task
environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2)
a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic
Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the
sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols
based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation.
Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language
Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental
protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally,
we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic
plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work
bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering
a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a
controlled biological substrate.

Motivation: 解决长时程多任务环境中策略跨域适应的挑战，特别是在模型不能更新且目标域数据极其有限的情况下，实现快速有效的策略迁移

Method: 采用跨域技能扩散方案，学习领域无关的原型技能和领域接地的技能适配器；开发动态域提示方案指导扩散技能适配器与目标域更好对齐

Result: 在Metaworld机器人操作和CARLA自动驾驶实验中，在各种跨域配置下（环境动态、智能体体现、任务时程差异）都取得了优越的策略适应性能

Conclusion: ICPAD框架通过扩散技能学习和动态提示技术，在有限数据条件下实现了有效的跨域策略适应，为长时程多任务环境中的快速策略迁移提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this work, we present an in-context policy adaptation (ICPAD) framework
designed for long-horizon multi-task environments, exploring diffusion-based
skill learning techniques in cross-domain settings. The framework enables rapid
adaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target
domains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only
limited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain
skill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a
domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an
offline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The
prototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of
long-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains.
Furthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a
dynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter
toward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with
robotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that
our $\oursol$ framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under
limited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations
including differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task
horizon.

Using only 100 expert demonstrations, equivalent to 6,300 environment
interactions, our method, which implements Action Chunking with Transformers
(ACT), learns a control policy that maps visual and state observations to
thrust and torque commands. ACT generates smoother, more consistent
trajectories than a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) baseline trained with
40 million interactions. We evaluate ACT on a rendezvous task: in-orbit docking
with the International Space Station (ISS). We show that our approach achieves
greater accuracy, smoother control, and greater sample efficiency.

TL;DR: SPOT是一种混合学习和规划方法，通过搜索点云对象变换序列来解决机器人操作的长时程规划问题，无需离散化动作或对象关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务规划方法需要将连续状态和动作空间离散化为符号描述，而SPOT利用学习模型作为领域特定先验来指导高维连续动作空间的搜索。

Method: SPOT从学习的建议器中采样候选动作，这些建议器在部分观测的点云上操作，搜索从初始场景点云到满足目标点云的变换序列。

Conclusion: SPOT通过搜索驱动的规划方法成功解决了长时程机器人操作规划问题，消融实验证明了搜索规划的重要性。

Abstract: Long-horizon planning for robot manipulation is a challenging problem that
requires reasoning about the effects of a sequence of actions on a physical 3D
scene. While traditional task planning methods are shown to be effective for
long-horizon manipulation, they require discretizing the continuous state and
action space into symbolic descriptions of objects, object relationships, and
actions. Instead, we propose a hybrid learning-and-planning approach that
leverages learned models as domain-specific priors to guide search in
high-dimensional continuous action spaces. We introduce SPOT: Search over Point
cloud Object Transformations, which plans by searching for a sequence of
transformations from an initial scene point cloud to a goal-satisfying point
cloud. SPOT samples candidate actions from learned suggesters that operate on
partially observed point clouds, eliminating the need to discretize actions or
object relationships. We evaluate SPOT on multi-object rearrangement tasks,
reporting task planning success and task execution success in both simulation
and real-world environments. Our experiments show that SPOT generates
successful plans and outperforms a policy-learning approach. We also perform
ablations that highlight the importance of search-based planning.

Motivation: 提升机器人触觉感知能力，改进多模态表面材料分类，为机器人操作和交互提供更好的感知支持。

Method: 基于Surformer v1框架改进，采用决策级融合机制：视觉分支使用CNN分类器(Efficient V-Net)，触觉分支使用仅编码器Transformer模型，通过可学习的加权和对输出logits进行融合。

Result: 在Touch and Go多模态基准数据集上表现良好，保持有竞争力的推理速度，适合实时机器人应用。

Conclusion: 决策级融合和基于Transformer的触觉建模能有效增强多模态机器人感知中的表面理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal surface material classification plays a critical role in advancing
tactile perception for robotic manipulation and interaction. In this paper, we
present Surformer v2, an enhanced multi-modal classification architecture
designed to integrate visual and tactile sensory streams through a
late(decision level) fusion mechanism. Building on our earlier Surformer v1
framework [1], which employed handcrafted feature extraction followed by
mid-level fusion architecture with multi-head cross-attention layers, Surformer
v2 integrates the feature extraction process within the model itself and shifts
to late fusion. The vision branch leverages a CNN-based classifier(Efficient
V-Net), while the tactile branch employs an encoder-only transformer model,
allowing each modality to extract modality-specific features optimized for
classification. Rather than merging feature maps, the model performs
decision-level fusion by combining the output logits using a learnable weighted
sum, enabling adaptive emphasis on each modality depending on data context and
training dynamics. We evaluate Surformer v2 on the Touch and Go dataset [2], a
multi-modal benchmark comprising surface images and corresponding tactile
sensor readings. Our results demonstrate that Surformer v2 performs well,
maintaining competitive inference speed, suitable for real-time robotic
applications. These findings underscore the effectiveness of decision-level
fusion and transformer-based tactile modeling for enhancing surface
understanding in multi-modal robotic perception.

Abstract: Automated vehicle control using reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted
significant attention due to its potential to learn driving policies through
environment interaction. However, RL agents often face training challenges in
sample efficiency and effective exploration, making it difficult to discover an
optimal driving strategy. To address these issues, we propose guiding the RL
driving agent with a demonstration policy that need not be a highly optimized
or expert-level controller. Specifically, we integrate a rule-based lane change
controller with the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance exploration
and learning efficiency. Our approach demonstrates improved driving performance
and can be extended to other driving scenarios that can similarly benefit from
demonstration-based guidance.

Abstract: As humanoid robots enter real-world environments, ensuring robust locomotion
across diverse environments is crucial. This paper presents a computationally
efficient hierarchical control framework for humanoid robot locomotion based on
reduced-order models -- enabling versatile step planning and incorporating arm
and torso dynamics to better stabilize the walking. At the high level, we use
the step-to-step dynamics of the ALIP model to simultaneously optimize over
step periods, step lengths, and ankle torques via nonlinear MPC. The ALIP
trajectories are used as references to a linear MPC framework that extends the
standard SRB-MPC to also include simplified arm and torso dynamics. We validate
the performance of our approach through simulation and hardware experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. In the proposed framework the high-level step
planner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard
mini-PC. Adaptive step timing increased the push recovery success rate by 36%,
and the upper body control improved the yaw disturbance rejection. We also
demonstrate robust locomotion across diverse indoor and outdoor terrains,

Abstract: In the field of robot learning, coordinating robot actions through language
instructions is becoming increasingly feasible. However, adapting actions to
human instructions remains challenging, as such instructions are often
qualitative and require exploring behaviors that satisfy varying conditions.
This paper proposes a motion generation model that adapts robot actions in
response to modifier directives human instructions imposing behavioral
conditions during task execution. The proposed method learns a mapping from
modifier directives to actions by segmenting demonstrations into short
sequences, assigning weakly supervised labels corresponding to specific
modifier types. We evaluated our method in wiping and pick and place tasks.
Results show that it can adjust motions online in response to modifier
directives, unlike conventional batch-based methods that cannot adapt during
execution.

Abstract: Continuous advancements in robotics and AI are driving the integration of
robots from industry into everyday environments. However, dynamic and
unpredictable human activities in daily lives would directly or indirectly
conflict with robot actions. Besides, due to the social attributes of such
human-induced conflicts, solutions are not always unique and depend highly on

development of household robots, we propose COMMET, a system for human-induced
COnflicts in Mobile Manipulation of Everyday Tasks. COMMET employs a hybrid
detection approach, which begins with multi-modal retrieval and escalates to
fine-tuned model inference for low-confidence cases. Based on collected user
preferred options and settings, GPT-4o will be used to summarize user
preferences from relevant cases. In preliminary studies, our detection module
shows better accuracy and latency compared with GPT models. To facilitate
future research, we also design a user-friendly interface for user data

Conclusion: 扩散模型与专家路由相结合，为知识驱动的端到端自动驾驶提供了一个可扩展且可解释的范式，专家表现出结构化专业化和跨场景重用特性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the need to generate
multi-modal actions, maintain temporal stability, and generalize across diverse
scenarios. Existing methods often collapse multi-modality, struggle with
long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents
KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion
modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion
component generates temporally coherent and multi-modal action sequences, while
the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts
according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive
experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP
achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and
smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight
the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and
activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse
of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable
and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.

*Emanuela Boros*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 系统评估了多种视觉描述符在办公室环境拓扑定位中的性能，包括颜色直方图、SIFT变体和词袋方法，通过定量比较和标准评估指标验证了不同配置的优势。

Motivation: 解决移动机器人在办公室环境中的拓扑定位问题，克服视觉定位和地点识别中的感知模糊性、传感器噪声和光照变化等挑战。

Method: 使用安装在机器人平台上的彩色相机获取图像，评估多种视觉描述符（颜色直方图、SIFT、ASIFT、RGB-SIFT、词袋方法），系统比较特征、距离度量和分类器的性能。

Result: 结果表明适当的表观描述符配置、相似性度量和分类器具有明显优势，系统在ImageCLEF评估活动中成功识别新图像序列的最可能位置。

Conclusion: 未来工作将探索分层模型、排序方法和特征组合，以构建更鲁棒的定位系统，减少训练和运行时间，避免维度灾难，最终实现跨不同光照条件和更长路线的实时集成定位。

Abstract: Topological localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, since
robots must be able to determine their position in order to accomplish tasks.
Visual localization and place recognition are challenging due to perceptual
ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. This work addresses
topological localization in an office environment using only images acquired
with a perspective color camera mounted on a robot platform, without relying on
temporal continuity of image sequences. We evaluate state-of-the-art visual
descriptors, including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and
Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches inspired by text retrieval. Our contributions
include a systematic, quantitative comparison of these features, distance
measures, and classifiers. Performance was analyzed using standard evaluation
metrics and visualizations, extending previous experiments. Results demonstrate
the advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity
measures, and classifiers. The quality of these configurations was further
validated in the Robot Vision task of the ImageCLEF evaluation campaign, where
the system identified the most likely location of novel image sequences. Future
work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature
combinations to build more robust localization systems, reducing training and
runtime while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Ultimately, this aims
toward integrated, real-time localization across varied illumination and longer
routes.

TL;DR: 基于八叉树结构的3D A*路径规划算法，通过高度罚分成本函数和节点压缩技术，在保证路径最优性的同时显著提高计算效率和减少内存占用。

Motivation: 无人地面车辆和腿式机器人在多种地形上的移动需求，需要将障碍物不仅视为要避免的阻碍，而是在有利时作为航行辅助。传统路径规划算法在计算效率和内存使用方面遇到挑战。

Method: 结合八叉树结构的修改版3D A*算法，在成本函数中添加高度基准罚分，允许利用可穿越障碍物辅助移动而避免不可穿越的障碍物。八叉树基于3D网格地图通过合并高分辨率节点来实现压缩。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的基于八叉树结构的3D A*路径规划方法，通过智能利用障碍物和压缩技术，实现了更高效、更现实的路径生成，为无人车辆和机器人提供了可靠的实时航行解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D path planning method that integrates the A*
algorithm with the octree structure. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and legged
robots have been extensively studied, enabling locomotion across a variety of
terrains. Advances in mobility have enabled obstacles to be regarded not only
as hindrances to be avoided, but also as navigational aids when beneficial. A
modified 3D A* algorithm generates an optimal path by leveraging obstacles
during the planning process. By incorporating a height-based penalty into the
cost function, the algorithm enables the use of traversable obstacles to aid
locomotion while avoiding those that are impassable, resulting in more
efficient and realistic path generation. The octree-based 3D grid map achieves
compression by merging high-resolution nodes into larger blocks, especially in
obstacle-free or sparsely populated areas. This reduces the number of nodes
explored by the A* algorithm, thereby improving computational efficiency and
memory usage, and supporting real-time path planning in practical environments.
Benchmark results demonstrate that the use of octree structure ensures an
optimal path while significantly reducing memory usage and computation time.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn to solve complex tasks from
visual inputs, but generalizing these learned skills to new environments
remains a major challenge in RL application, especially robotics. While data
augmentation can improve generalization, it often compromises sample efficiency
and training stability. This paper introduces DeGuV, an RL framework that
enhances both generalization and sample efficiency. In specific, we leverage a
learnable masker network that produces a mask from the depth input, preserving
only critical visual information while discarding irrelevant pixels. Through
this, we ensure that our RL agents focus on essential features, improving
robustness under data augmentation. In addition, we incorporate contrastive
learning and stabilize Q-value estimation under augmentation to further enhance
sample efficiency and training stability. We evaluate our proposed method on
the RL-ViGen benchmark using the Franka Emika robot and demonstrate its
effectiveness in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Our results show that DeGuV
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and sample
efficiency while also improving interpretability by highlighting the most
relevant regions in the visual input

Abstract: Deep learning, with its exceptional learning capabilities and flexibility,
has been widely applied in various applications. However, its black-box nature
poses a significant challenge in real-time robotic applications, particularly
in robot control, where trustworthiness and robustness are critical in ensuring
safety. In robot motion control, it is essential to analyze and ensure system
stability, necessitating the establishment of methodologies that address this
need. This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework for end-to-end deep
learning control that can be integrated into existing robot control theories.
The proposed control algorithm leverages a modular learning approach to update
the weights of all layers in real time, ensuring system stability based on
Lyapunov-like analysis. Experimental results on industrial robots are presented
to illustrate the performance of the proposed deep learning controller. The
proposed method offers an effective solution to the black-box problem in deep
learning, demonstrating the possibility of deploying real-time deep learning
strategies for robot kinematic control in a stable manner. This achievement
provides a critical foundation for future advancements in deep learning based
real-time robotic applications.

Abstract: Developing efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies is crucial for
practical robotics deployment, yet current approaches face prohibitive
computational costs and resource requirements. Existing diffusion-based VLA
policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve
strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions:
intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head
by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN
conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We
integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER.
Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance
with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world
benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments. In
addition, FLOWER achieves a new SoTA of 4.53 on the CALVIN ABC benchmark.

Motivation: 传统方法假设感知误差为零均值高斯噪声，但实际深度学习感知模块存在有偏、重尾的非高斯噪声，需要更准确的感知不确定性量化来确保安全反馈控制

Conclusion: 所提出的感知感知MPC框架能够有效处理深度学习感知模块的非高斯噪声，确保闭环稳定性，为实际机器人系统的安全控制提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that
explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based
perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate
uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe
feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of
zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs
set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,
heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To
improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear
program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added
slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is
ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic
invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding
feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the
zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and
hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and
a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a
ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides
stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,
significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms
of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

Abstract: Deictic gestures, like pointing, are a fundamental form of non-verbal
communication, enabling humans to direct attention to specific objects or
locations. This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where
robots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate
responses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer
(MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop
scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural
pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing
gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and
identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can
accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling
intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the
performance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the
model's predictions across candidate object locations. Code available at:

Abstract: Shared autonomy is a promising paradigm in robotic systems, particularly
within the maritime domain, where complex, high-risk, and uncertain
environments necessitate effective human-robot collaboration. This paper
investigates the interaction of three complementary approaches to advance
shared autonomy in heterogeneous marine robotic fleets: (i) the integration of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate intuitive high-level task
specification and support hull inspection missions, (ii) the implementation of
human-in-the-loop interaction frameworks in multi-agent settings to enable
adaptive and intent-aware coordination, and (iii) the development of a modular
Mission Manager based on Behavior Trees to provide interpretable and flexible
mission control. Preliminary results from simulation and real-world lake-like
environments demonstrate the potential of this multi-layered architecture to
reduce operator cognitive load, enhance transparency, and improve adaptive
behaviour alignment with human intent. Ongoing work focuses on fully
integrating these components, refining coordination mechanisms, and validating
the system in operational port scenarios. This study contributes to
establishing a modular and scalable foundation for trustworthy,
human-collaborative autonomy in safety-critical maritime robotics applications.

Method: 使用空间扩展的El Farol酒吧问题作为测试平台，观察LLM智能体在60%阈值约束下的决策行为和社会互动

Result: LLM智能体产生了自发的酒吧访问动机，形成集体决策行为，但未能完全解决问题，行为模式更接近人类而非完美理性

Conclusion: LLM智能体能够自然平衡形式化游戏理论理性与社会动机，实现了传统游戏理论无法处理的新型群体决策模型

Abstract: We investigate the emergent social dynamics of Large Language Model (LLM)
agents in a spatially extended El Farol Bar problem, observing how they
autonomously navigate this classic social dilemma. As a result, the LLM agents
generated a spontaneous motivation to go to the bar and changed their decision
making by becoming a collective. We also observed that the LLM agents did not
solve the problem completely, but rather behaved more like humans. These
findings reveal a complex interplay between external incentives
(prompt-specified constraints such as the 60\% threshold) and internal
incentives (culturally-encoded social preferences derived from pre-training),
demonstrating that LLM agents naturally balance formal game-theoretic
rationality with social motivations that characterize human behavior. These
findings suggest that a new model of group decision making, which could not be
handled in the previous game-theoretic problem setting, can be realized by LLM
agents.

Motivation: 6G网络中单个网络设备的有限资源严重阻碍了具备复杂工具调用的LLM代理的高效运行，引发对高效多级别设备协作的紧迫需求

Method: 提出具有外循环和内循环的双循环终端-边缘协作框架：外循环通过任务分解和并行子任务分配增强规划能力；内循环使用专门角色的子代理循环推理、执行和重新规划，并结合并行工具调用生成和出置策略提高效率

Abstract: The ubiquitous computing resources in 6G networks provide ideal environments
for the fusion of large language models (LLMs) and intelligent services through
the agent framework. With auxiliary modules and planning cores, LLM-enabled
agents can autonomously plan and take actions to deal with diverse environment
semantics and user intentions. However, the limited resources of individual
network devices significantly hinder the efficient operation of LLM-enabled
agents with complex tool calls, highlighting the urgent need for efficient
multi-level device collaborations. To this end, the framework and method of the
LLM-enabled multi-agent system with dual-loop terminal-edge collaborations are
proposed in 6G networks. Firstly, the outer loop consists of the iterative
collaborations between the global agent and multiple sub-agents deployed on
edge servers and terminals, where the planning capability is enhanced through
task decomposition and parallel sub-task distribution. Secondly, the inner loop
utilizes sub-agents with dedicated roles to circularly reason, execute, and
replan the sub-task, and the parallel tool calling generation with offloading
strategies is incorporated to improve efficiency. The improved task planning
capability and task execution efficiency are validated through the conducted
case study in 6G-supported urban safety governance. Finally, the open
challenges and future directions are thoroughly analyzed in 6G networks,
accelerating the advent of the 6G era.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统的人格化趋势增强，种族化在人机交互中的潜在影响得到不足的研究。本研究意在探索认为AI系统培训数据来自特定种族群体的情况下，如何影响人与AI的合作关系

Method: 使用Pig Chase游戏进行人机合作任务，操纳AI代理的感知种族身份，收集不同自我识别人口统计学特征参与者的行为数据。游戏后通过问卷调查了解参与者的策略和对AI队友智力的评价，并使用ACT-R认知架构建立基线认知模型

Result: 统计分析显示参与者人口统计学特征和处理条件（AI代理感知种族）之间存在显著交互效应。非白人参与者对白人化AI代理持正面态度，而对黑人化AI代理持负面态度。黑人和白人参与者都对对照组AI代理持负面态度

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要扩展对种族化（显性或隐性）如何影响人与AI系统交互的理解，认知模型有助于更好地理解游戏参与者决策策略的影响因素

Abstract: Despite the continued anthropomorphization of AI systems, the potential
impact of racialization during human-AI interaction is understudied. This study
explores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used
to train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a
specific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI
cooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different
self-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial
identities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural
perspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After
the game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the
strategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived
intelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data
revealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic,
as well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the
treatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results
indicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a
positive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White
participants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A
baseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was
used to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the
participants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model
helps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies
of the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as
cognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways
racialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI
systems.

Motivation: 探索AI大语言模型在纺织制造业各个阶段（包括可持续选择、成本效益、生产规划等）中的作用，帮助设计师在开发实际模型前评估效果、进行修改和进行时尚预测。

Method: 使用自建的纺织图像生成和分类数据集，测试三种LLM模型在多个纺织制造阶段的表现，包括不同身材类型和功能用途（时尚服、运动服）的服装设计重现。评估参数包括纺织结构、色彩、织物组织、形状等。

Result: OpenAI DALL-E模型在纺织生成任务中表现最好，LPIPS分数约为0.2。在纺织分类中，OpenAI在基础结构分类上达到80%准确率，详细结构为55%。Deepseek模型在纺织图像生成和识别上遇到重大困难。所有模型在处理复杂纺织结构和精细设计时都遇到困难。但在文本形式的纺织设计建议和见解方面，三种模型都表现有效。

Conclusion: AI模型在纺织制造业中具有应用潜力，特别是在文本建议和时尚预测方面。但对复杂纺织结构的识别仍面临挑战，过度依赖AI可能会限制人类创造力。建议在人机协同的框架下使用这些工具。

Abstract: Fashion has evolved from handcrafted designs to automated production over the
years, where AI has added another dimension to it. Nowadays, practically every
industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their
role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple
stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness,
production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate
garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave,
silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and
functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could
evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary
modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper
analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation
and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric
construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed
other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images,
we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors
(e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving
approximately $80\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\%$ for detailed
construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant
challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models
struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from
images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also
observed that all three models performed effectively in providing
recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.

Abstract: This paper introduces SePA (Search-enhanced Predictive AI Agent), a novel LLM
health coaching system that integrates personalized machine learning and
retrieval-augmented generation to deliver adaptive, evidence-based guidance.
SePA combines: (1) Individualized models predicting daily stress, soreness, and
injury risk from wearable sensor data (28 users, 1260 data points); and (2) A
retrieval module that grounds LLM-generated feedback in expert-vetted web
content to ensure contextual relevance and reliability. Our predictive models,
evaluated with rolling-origin cross-validation and group k-fold
cross-validation show that personalized models outperform generalized
baselines. In a pilot expert study (n=4), SePA's retrieval-based advice was
preferred over a non-retrieval baseline, yielding meaningful practical effect
(Cliff's $\delta$=0.3, p=0.05). We also quantify latency performance trade-offs
between response quality and speed, offering a transparent blueprint for
next-generation, trustworthy personal health informatics systems.

*Eneko Atxa Landa,Elena Lazkano,Igor Rodriguez,Itsaso Rodríguez-Moreno,Itziar Irigoien*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了游戏和虚拟应用中的空闲动画问题，发现演员演技和真实的空闲动作在用户感知上都被认为是真实的，且用户无法区分二者。这为简化空闲动画采集过程提供了重要见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现谨实的虚拟角色需要高质量的空闲动画，但目前手工制作或演员录制成本昂贵，且真实的空闲动作采集复杂。缺乏广泛可用的空闲动画数据集。

Method: 研究比较了演员演技的空闲动作和真实的空闲动作，分析用户对二者真实性的感知咃区分能力。

Result: 发现演员演技和真实的空闲动画在用户感知上都被认为是真实的，用户无法区分二者；手工制作和录制的空闲动画在感知上存在差异。

Conclusion: 空闲动画的录制比以前认为的更简单，演员可以被明确要求演技动作，显著简化录制过程。这为未来空闲动画数据集的采集提供了重要指导。论文还发布了ReActIdle三维空闲动画数据集。

Abstract: Animating realistic avatars requires using high quality animations for every
possible state the avatar can be in. This includes actions like walking or
running, but also subtle movements that convey emotions and personality. Idle
animations, such as standing, breathing or looking around, are crucial for
realism and believability. In games and virtual applications, these are often
handcrafted or recorded with actors, but this is costly. Furthermore, recording
realistic idle animations can be very complex, because the actor must not know
they are being recorded in order to make genuine movements. For this reasons
idle animation datasets are not widely available. Nevertheless, this paper
concludes that both acted and genuine idle animations are perceived as real,
and that users are not able to distinguish between them. It also states that
handmade and recorded idle animations are perceived differently. These two
conclusions mean that recording idle animations should be easier than it is
thought to be, meaning that actors can be specifically told to act the
movements, significantly simplifying the recording process. These conclusions
should help future efforts to record idle animation datasets. Finally, we also
publish ReActIdle, a 3 dimensional idle animation dataset containing both real
and acted idle motions.

TL;DR: 研究通过访谈十名Apple Vision Pro用户，探索扩展现实(XR)设备在生产力场景中的长期使用情况。虽然用户认为XR能提高生产力，但仍存在应用程序缺乏、工作流集成困难等限制其普及使用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前市场营销宣传XR设备作为生产力工具，但研究缺乏对这类设备在真实生活环境中长期使用情况的理解。

Method: 采用质性研究方法，访谈十名有经验的Apple Vision Pro用户，了解他们如何使用设备以及遇到的问题。

Result: 用户报告表示XR可以提高生产力，且经过一段时间后能够适应设备。但同时也持续存在多种限制因素：缺乏原生应用程序、与现有工作流集成困难、XR体验自定义选项有限等。

Conclusion: 虽然XR在生产力场景中具有潜力，但当前的限制因素可能阻碍其广泛推广和量产化使用。需要进一步改进设备功能和生态系统以支持真正的生产力需求。

Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) is increasingly used as a productivity tool and recent
commercial XR devices have even been specifically designed as productivity
tools, or, at least, are heavily advertised for such purposes, such as the
Apple Vision Pro (AVP), which has now been available for more than one year. In
spite of what marketing suggests, research still lacks an understanding of the
long-term usage of such devices in ecologically valid everyday settings, as
most studies are conducted in very controlled environments. Therefore, we
conducted interviews with ten AVP users to better understand how experienced
users engage with the device, and which limitations persist. Our participants
report that XR can increase productivity and that they got used to the device
after some time. Yet, a range of limitations persist that might hinder the
widespread use of XR as a productivity tool, such as a lack of native
applications, difficulties when integrating XR into current workflows, and
limited possibilities to adapt and customize the XR experience.

Motivation: 研究GrooveTransformer系统如何在不同应用场景中自然涌现出多稳定性，而非最初设计目标

Method: 采用后现象学的变分交叉检验(VCE)框架，分析系统在三个艺术部署场景：自主鼓伴奏生成器、Eurorack节奏控制电压序列器、和声伴奏系统的节奏驱动

Result: 识别出三个关键因素促成多稳定性涌现：系统不变量的可供性、跨学科合作、以及情境化开发过程

Conclusion: VCE作为数字音乐乐器设计的描述和分析方法具有可行性，能够揭示技术如何中介、共同塑造并被用户和情境共同塑造

Abstract: This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation
system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational
Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct
artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum
accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack
format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The
versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the
project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we
identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system
invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its
development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive
and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing
its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped
by users and contexts.

Motivation: 利用近实时路面交通数据来研究汽车基于的人类移动行为转变，特别是在COVID大流行前后期间，为减少碳排放和环境管理提供决策支持。

Method: 开发了一个可重现的工作流来计算多维度交通流变量，使用卢森堡堡布的传感器IoT技术收集的路面交通数据，进行了全面的数据协调和缺失值处理。

Abstract: Many transport authorities are collecting and publishing almost real-time
road traffic data to meet the growing trend of massive open data, a vital
resource for foresight decision support systems considering deep data insights.
Using such a traffic count dataset, we explored the spatio-temporal transitions
in the cross-country road traffic volumes in the context of modelling
behavioural transitions in car-based human mobility. We developed a
reproducible workflow for computing multi-dimensional variables of traffic
flow. This study reports on individual car-based daily travel behaviour
detected, before (2016-2018) and during the COVID pandemic (2019-2021), between
Germany and neighbouring countries (Luxembourg, France and Belgium). In
relevance to the net-zero carbon transition, further study should shed light on
the interpolation and downscaling approaches at the comprehensive road-network
level for identifying pollution hot spots, causal link to functional landuse
patterns and calculation of spatial influence area. In the case of Luxembourg,
the Bridges and Roads Authority has installed a large digital traffic
observatory infrastructure through the adoption of sensor-based IoT
technologies, like other European member states. Since 2016, they have provided
high-performance data processing and published open data on the country's road
traffic. The dataset contains an hourly traffic count for different vehicle
types, daily for representative observation points, followed by a major road
network. The original dataset contains significant missing entries, so
comprehensive data harmonization was performed.

TL;DR: 英国大选前32%聊天机器人用户通过AI获取政治信息，实验证明AI对政治知识的影响与传统搜索引擎相似，不会增加错误信息信任


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查聊天式AI在政治预选信息获取中的使用程度和对政治知识的影响，因为存在偏见和幽灵输出导致武断选民的风险

Method: 使用代表性全国调查(N=2,499)和一系列随机对照实验(N=2,858)，测量AI聊天机器人在政治信息寻找中的使用情况和对真实信息/错误信息信任的影响

Result: 在英国大选前一周，13%选民使用AI获取政治信息；AI聊天能够提高真实信息信任并降低错误信息信任，效果与传统网络搜索相似

Conclusion: 虽然越来越多人通过聊天式AI获取政治信息，但这种转变可能不会导致政治错误信息信任的增加

Abstract: Conversational AI systems are increasingly being used in place of traditional
search engines to help users complete information-seeking tasks. This has
raised concerns in the political domain, where biased or hallucinated outputs
could misinform voters or distort public opinion. However, in spite of these
concerns, the extent to which conversational AI is used for political
information-seeking, as well the potential impact of this use on users'
political knowledge, remains uncertain. Here, we address these questions:
First, in a representative national survey of the UK public (N = 2,499), we
find that in the week before the 2024 election as many as 32% of chatbot users
- and 13% of eligible UK voters - have used conversational AI to seek political
information relevant to their electoral choice. Second, in a series of
randomised controlled trials (N = 2,858 total) we find that across issues,
models, and prompting strategies, conversations with AI increase political
knowledge (increase belief in true information and decrease belief in
misinformation) to the same extent as self-directed internet search. Taken
together, our results suggest that although people in the UK are increasingly
turning to conversational AI for information about politics, this shift may not
lead to increased public belief in political misinformation.

Motivation: 水下被动声学监测存在固有噪声和复杂信号依赖性问题，传统方法难以处理环境噪声变化、传播效应多样性和混合声源带来的挑战

Method: 采用站点-年份分块的分层嵌套交叉验证框架，保持记录异质性；提出ARPA-N网络，使用自适应分辨率池化和空间注意力机制处理不规则频谱图

Result: ARPA-N在平均精度上比DenseNet基线提升14.4%，所有指标的变异性降低数量级，实现跨站点-年份折叠的一致检测

Conclusion: GetNetUPAM框架和ARPA-N架构显著提升了水下生物声学监测的准确性和可扩展性，为生态声学分析提供了稳健的评估基础

Abstract: Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (UPAM) provides rich spatiotemporal
data for long-term ecological analysis, but intrinsic noise and complex signal
dependencies hinder model stability and generalization. Multilayered windowing
has improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient
noise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic
sources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce
GetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to
quantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are
partitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording
heterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental
subset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year
blocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while
standard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across
UPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks.
Using GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution
Pooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular
spectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the
receptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under
GetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet
baselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all
metrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing
scalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, their
reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely
unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic
music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to
interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries.
Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and
accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing
the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic
evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and
fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music
reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and
scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical
benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns
in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and
persistent challenges for MLLMs in symbolic music reasoning and analysis. We
release the dataset and code.

Motivation: 传统快速约化变换(FFT)方法在语音增强中存在相位不协调和能量损失问题，需要一种更有效的变换方法来提高语音与噪声的区分能力

Method: 将维纳筛波器和谱减法筛波器中的FFT替换为量子约化变换(QFT)，保持相同的超参数设置以便公平比较

Result: 在清洁语音、合成音调和噪声混合体的实验中，在多种SNR条件下都实现了统计上显著的SNR提升，最高可达15dB，同时减少了人工噪声的产生

Conclusion: QFT基于的去噪方法在低SNR和非稳态噪声场景下体现了稳健性，而且无需额外计算开销，为量子增强语音处理提供了可扩展的发展路径

Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum-inspired denoising framework that integrates
the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) into classical audio enhancement pipelines.
Unlike conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based methods, QFT provides a
unitary transformation with global phase coherence and energy preservation,
enabling improved discrimination between speech and noise. The proposed
approach replaces FFT in Wiener and spectral subtraction filters with a QFT
operator, ensuring consistent hyperparameter settings for fair comparison.
Experiments on clean speech, synthetic tones, and noisy mixtures across diverse
signal to noise ratio (SNR) conditions, demonstrate statistically significant
gains in SNR, with up to 15 dB improvement and reduced artifact generation.
Results confirm that QFT based denoising offers robustness under low SNR and
nonstationary noise scenarios without additional computational overhead,
highlighting its potential as a scalable pathway toward quantum-enhanced speech
processing.

Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的作曲软件结构复杂，难以分析模型如何理解作曲家音乐特征，需要更简单可解释的模型

Method: 采用受限玻尔兹曼机(RBM)训练J.S.巴赫的音乐作品，利用其简单结构分析学习后的内部状态

Result: 学习后的RBM能够成功创作音乐作品

Conclusion: RBM作为一种结构简单的模型，既能模仿巴赫音乐风格进行创作，又便于分析其内部学习机制

Abstract: Recently, software has been developed that uses machine learning to mimic the
style of a particular composer, such as J. S. Bach. However, since such
software often adopts machine learning models with complex structures, it is
difficult to analyze how the software understands the characteristics of the
composer's music. In this study, we adopted J. S. Bach's music for training of
a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Since the structure of RBMs is simple, it
allows us to investigate the internal states after learning. We found that the
learned RBM is able to compose music.

Motivation: 音乐对抗攻击在音乐信息检索领域受到关注，当前MIR系统存在安全漏洞，需要开发更有效的攻击方法来揭示这些漏洞并推动更鲁棒的模型发展。

Method: 首先进行重要性分析识别关键音频片段，然后使用生成式修复模型在目标模型输出指导下重构这些片段，产生细微但有效的对抗扰动。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前MIR系统的脆弱性，强调了开发更鲁棒和安全模型的必要性，MAIA框架为评估和改进MIR系统安全性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Music adversarial attacks have garnered significant interest in the field of
Music Information Retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we present Music Adversarial
Inpainting Attack (MAIA), a novel adversarial attack framework that supports
both white-box and black-box attack scenarios. MAIA begins with an importance
analysis to identify critical audio segments, which are then targeted for
modification. Utilizing generative inpainting models, these segments are
reconstructed with guidance from the output of the attacked model, ensuring
subtle and effective adversarial perturbations. We evaluate MAIA on multiple
MIR tasks, demonstrating high attack success rates in both white-box and
black-box settings while maintaining minimal perceptual distortion.
Additionally, subjective listening tests confirm the high audio fidelity of the
adversarial samples. Our findings highlight vulnerabilities in current MIR
systems and emphasize the need for more robust and secure models.

Method: 基于冻结的MERT编码器构建心理声学条件化的序列对比transformer轻量级投影头，实现架构集成的心理声学条件化

Result: Spearman相关系数达到0.65，优于现有感知指标；在Cover Song Identification和Music Genre Classification等MIR任务上，对抗攻击下的鲁棒准确率平均提升9.15%

Conclusion: 该工作开创了架构集成的心理声学条件化方法，产生的表示与人类感知更加对齐，对音乐对抗攻击具有显著鲁棒性

Abstract: Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks that are often imperceptible to humans, primarily due to a
misalignment between model feature spaces and human auditory perception.
Existing defenses and perceptual metrics frequently fail to adequately capture
these auditory nuances, a limitation supported by our initial listening tests
showing low correlation between common metrics and human judgments. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Perceptually-Aligned MERT Transformer (PAMT), a novel
framework for learning robust, perceptually-aligned music representations. Our
core innovation lies in the psychoacoustically-conditioned sequential
contrastive transformer, a lightweight projection head built atop a frozen MERT
encoder. PAMT achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.65 with
subjective scores, outperforming existing perceptual metrics. Our approach also
achieves an average of 9.15\% improvement in robust accuracy on challenging MIR
tasks, including Cover Song Identification and Music Genre Classification,
under diverse perceptual adversarial attacks. This work pioneers
architecturally-integrated psychoacoustic conditioning, yielding
representations significantly more aligned with human perception and robust
against music adversarial attacks.

Result: 评估显示编辑描述中每个部分（动作、类别、时序）都很重要，系统能够有效执行声音事件编辑任务

Conclusion: 重组合是音频处理中一个重要且实用的应用方向

Abstract: Editing complex real-world sound scenes is difficult because individual sound
sources overlap in time. Generative models can fill-in missing or corrupted
details based on their strong prior understanding of the data domain. We
present a system for editing individual sound events within complex scenes able
to delete, insert, and enhance individual sound events based on textual edit
descriptions (e.g., ``enhance Door'') and a graphical representation of the
event timing derived from an ``event roll'' transcription. We present an
encoder-decoder transformer working on SoundStream representations, trained on
synthetic (input, desired output) audio example pairs formed by adding isolated
sound events to dense, real-world backgrounds. Evaluation reveals the
importance of each part of the edit descriptions -- action, class, timing. Our
work demonstrates ``recomposition'' is an important and practical application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机风险评估框架需要已知不同原因下事故发生的条件概率，但计算这些概率的数据有限，且现有框架缺乏风险缓解控制方法。

Method: 基于无人机动力学，使用可达性分析对所有可行轨迹进行概率风险评估，并制定控制优化问题来最小化修改现有控制律以满足风险边界要求。

Result: 仿真实验显示，PRReach控制器相比经典控制器，离线风险降低达24%，在线风险降低达53%。

Conclusion: PRReach方法利用公开可用的无人机动力学模型和开源空间数据，能够实现离线飞行前和在线飞行中的风险评估与缓解，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present a new approach for designing risk-bounded controllers for Uncrewed
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Existing frameworks for assessing risk of UAV
operations rely on knowing the conditional probability of an incident occurring
given different causes. Limited data for computing these probabilities makes
real-world implementation of these frameworks difficult. Furthermore, existing
frameworks do not include control methods for risk mitigation. Our approach
relies on UAV dynamics, and employs reachability analysis for a probabilistic
risk assessment over all feasible UAV trajectories. We use this holistic risk
assessment to formulate a control optimization problem that minimally changes a
UAV's existing control law to be bounded by an accepted risk threshold. We call
our approach PRReach. Public and readily available UAV dynamics models and open
source spatial data for mapping hazard outcomes enables practical
implementation of PRReach for both offline pre-flight and online in-flight risk
assessment and mitigation. We evaluate PRReach through simulation experiments
on real-world data. Results show that PRReach controllers reduce risk by up to
24% offline, and up to 53% online from classical controllers.

Abstract: Memristors are an emerging technology that enables artificial intelligence
(AI) accelerators with high energy efficiency and radiation robustness --
properties that are vital for the deployment of AI on-board spacecraft.
However, space applications require reliable and precise computations, while
memristive devices suffer from non-idealities, such as device variability,
conductance drifts, and device faults. Thus, porting neural networks (NNs) to
memristive devices often faces the challenge of severe performance degradation.
In this work, we show in simulations that memristor-based NNs achieve
competitive performance levels on on-board tasks, such as navigation \& control
and geodesy of asteroids. Through bit-slicing, temporal averaging of NN layers,
and periodic activation functions, we improve initial results from around
$0.07$ to $0.01$ and $0.3$ to $0.007$ for both tasks using RRAM devices, coming
close to state-of-the-art levels ($0.003-0.005$ and $0.003$, respectively). Our
results demonstrate the potential of memristors for on-board space
applications, and we are convinced that future technology and NN improvements
will further close the performance gap to fully unlock the benefits of
memristors.

TL;DR: 提出IZR和IZE两种新方法，通过引入松弛容差水平来高效解决随机约束下的系统可行性判定问题，相比现有方法显著减少模拟次数


<details>

Motivation: 现有IZ方法使用固定容差水平导致不必要的模拟，而IZ-free方法在系统性能接近阈值时表现不佳，需要更高效的统计有效方法

Method: IZR引入一组松弛容差水平，使用两个子程序分别识别明显可行和明显不可行的系统；IZE为每个系统和约束引入两个松弛容差水平，一个匹配原始容差，一个基于性能估计

Result: 理论证明IZR和IZE能以期望概率确定系统可行性，实验表明相比现有方法显著减少所需观测次数

Conclusion: IZR和IZE方法通过动态调整容差水平，在保持统计有效性的同时提高了计算效率，解决了随机约束下系统可行性判定的关键问题

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding feasible systems with respect to
stochastic constraints when system performance is evaluated through simulation.
Our objective is to solve this problem with high computational efficiency and
statistical validity. Existing indifference-zone (IZ) procedures introduce a
fixed tolerance level, which denotes how much deviation the decision-maker is
willing to accept from the threshold in the constraint. These procedures are
developed under the assumption that all systems' performance measures are
exactly the tolerance level away from the threshold, leading to unnecessary
simulations. In contrast, IZ-free procedures, which eliminate the tolerance
level, perform well when systems' performance measures are far from the
threshold. However, they may significantly underperform compared to IZ
procedures when systems' performance measures are close to the threshold. To
address these challenges, we propose the Indifference-Zone Relaxation (IZR)
procedure, IZR introduces a set of relaxed tolerance levels and utilizes two
subroutines for each level: one to identify systems that are clearly feasible
and the other to exclude those that are clearly infeasible. We also develop the
IZR procedure with estimation (IZE), which introduces two relaxed tolerance
levels for each system and constraint: one matching the original tolerance
level and the other based on an estimate of the system's performance measure.
By employing different tolerance levels, these procedures facilitate early
feasibility determination with statistical validity. We prove that IZR and IZE
determine system feasibility with the desired probability and show through
experiments that they significantly reduce the number of observations required
compared to an existing procedure.

Abstract: Driven by growing concerns over air quality and energy security, electric
vehicles (EVs) has experienced rapid development and are reshaping global
transportation systems and lifestyle patterns. Compared to traditional
gasoline-powered vehicles, EVs offer significant advantages in terms of lower
energy consumption, reduced emissions, and decreased operating costs. However,
there are still some core challenges to be addressed: (i) Charging station
congestion and operational inefficiencies during peak hours, (ii) High charging
cost under dynamic electricity pricing schemes, and (iii) Conflicts between
charging needs and passenger service requirements.Hence, in this paper, we
present a comprehensive review of data-driven models and approaches proposed in
the literature to address the above challenges. These studies cover the entire
lifecycle of EV systems, including charging station deployment, charging
scheduling strategies, and large-scale fleet management. Moreover, we discuss
the broader implications of EV integration across multiple domains, such as
human mobility, smart grid infrastructure, and environmental sustainability,
and identify key opportunities and directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理同时包含有界随机扰动和无界模型不确定性的复杂系统，导致状态分布未知、形状任意且可能发散，造成不可预测和不安全的行为

Method: 采用L1自适应控制架构，在概率测度空间提供Wasserstein度量证书，并将这些分布证书融入高层协方差控制中

Conclusion: 该方法为不确定非线性随机过程提供了可预测且安全的协方差控制解决方案，具有更好的实用性和验证便利性

Abstract: We present a methodology for predictable and safe covariance steering control
of uncertain nonlinear stochastic processes. The systems under consideration
are subject to general uncertainties, which include unbounded random
disturbances (aleatoric uncertainties) and incomplete model knowledge
(state-dependent epistemic uncertainties). These general uncertainties lead to
temporally evolving state distributions that are entirely unknown, can have
arbitrary shapes, and may diverge unquantifiably from expected behaviors,
leading to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors. Our method relies on an
$\mathcal{L}_1$-adaptive control architecture that ensures robust control of
uncertain stochastic processes while providing Wasserstein metric certificates
in the space of probability measures. We show how these distributional
certificates can be incorporated into the high-level covariance control
steering to guarantee safe control. Unlike existing distributionally robust
planning and control methodologies, our approach avoids difficult-to-verify
requirements like the availability of finite samples from the true underlying
distribution or an a priori knowledge of time-varying ambiguity sets to which
the state distributions are assumed to belong.

Conclusion: L1-DRAC为不确定随机过程提供了具有理论保证的分布鲁棒控制框架，成功整合了数据驱动方法和传统鲁棒控制的优势。

Abstract: Data-driven machine learning methodologies have attracted considerable
attention for the control and estimation of dynamical systems. However, such
implementations suffer from a lack of predictability and robustness. Thus,
adoption of data-driven tools has been minimal for safety-aware applications
despite their impressive empirical results. While classical tools like robust
adaptive control can ensure predictable performance, their consolidation with
data-driven methods remains a challenge and, when attempted, leads to
conservative results. The difficulty of consolidation stems from the inherently
different `spaces' that robust control and data-driven methods occupy.
Data-driven methods suffer from the distribution-shift problem, which current
robust adaptive controllers can only tackle if using over-simplified learning
models and unverifiable assumptions. In this paper, we present $\mathcal{L}_1$
distributionally robust adaptive control ($\mathcal{L}_1$-DRAC): a control
methodology for uncertain stochastic processes that guarantees robustness
certificates in terms of uniform (finite-time) and maximal distributional
deviation. We leverage the $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control methodology to
ensure the existence of Wasserstein ambiguity set around a nominal
distribution, which is guaranteed to contain the true distribution. The uniform
ambiguity set produces an ambiguity tube of distributions centered on the
nominal temporally-varying nominal distribution. The designed controller
generates the ambiguity tube in response to both epistemic (model
uncertainties) and aleatoric (inherent randomness and disturbances)
uncertainties.

Method: 基于贝叶斯框架，引入新的定量可诊断性定义，开发主动故障识别策略设计控制输入以改善故障识别

Result: 在两水箱系统和火星卫星等复杂不连续动力学系统上的数值研究表明，该方法显著降低故障率，识别延迟更短

Conclusion: 主动故障识别策略相比纯被动技术能更有效地克服控制序列带来的根本限制，提升故障识别性能

Abstract: We study fault identification in discrete-time nonlinear systems subject to
additive Gaussian white noise. We introduce a Bayesian framework that
explicitly accounts for unmodeled faults under reasonable assumptions. Our
approach hinges on a new quantitative diagnosability definition, revealing when
passive fault identification (FID) is fundamentally limited by the given
control sequence. To overcome such limitations, we propose an active FID
strategy that designs control inputs for better fault identification. Numerical
studies on a two-water tank system and a Mars satellite with complex and
discontinuous dynamics demonstrate that our method significantly reduces
failure rates with shorter identification delays compared to purely passive
techniques.

Abstract: The pinching-antenna systems (PASS), which activate small dielectric
particles along a dielectric waveguide, has recently emerged as a promising
paradigm for flexible antenna deployment in next-generation wireless
communication networks. While most existing studies assume rectangular indoor
layouts with full coverage waveguide, practical deployments may involve
geometric constraints, partial coverage, and non-negligible waveguide
attenuation. This paper presents the first analytical investigation of PASS in
a circular indoor environment, encompassing both full coverage and partial
coverage waveguide configurations with/without propagation loss. A unified
geometric-propagation framework is developed that jointly captures
pinching-antenna placement, Internet of Things (IoT) device location
distribution, and waveguide attenuation. Closed-form expressions for the outage
probability and average achievable rate are derived for four scenarios, with
accuracy validated via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The analysis reveals
that, under the partial coverage waveguide scenario with propagation loss, the
system performance demonstrates a non-monotonic trend with respect to the
waveguide length, and the optimal length decreases as the attenuation
coefficient increases. Numerical results further quantify the interplay between
deployment strategy, waveguide propagation loss, and coverage geometry,
offering practical guidelines for performance-oriented PASS design.

Conclusion: 芬兰公共细胞网络能够满足铁路网络控制的严格性能要求，为从GSM-R向公共4G/5G网络迁移提供了技术支撑

Abstract: There is growing interest in using public cellular networks for specialized
communication applications, replacing standalone sector-specific networks. One
such application is transitioning from the aging GSM-R railway network to
public 4G and 5G networks. Finland is modernizing its railway communication
system through the Digirail project, leveraging public cellular networks. To
evaluate network performance, a nationwide measurement campaign was conducted
in two modes: Best Quality and Packet Replication. However, Best Quality mode
introduces artificial delays, making it unsuitable for real-world assessments.
In this paper, railway network delays are modeled using machine learning based
on measurements from the Packet Replication mode. The best-performing model is
then employed to generate a dataset estimating network delays across Finland's
railway network. This dataset provides a more accurate representation of
network performance. Machine learning based network performance prediction is
shown to be feasible, and the results indicate that Finland's public cellular
network can meet the stringent performance requirements of railway network
control.

Abstract: Nowadays, the majority of wearable thermal feedback systems designed for use
in virtual reality applications are not compatible or not integrated to
standard controllers and are based on temperature control. The objectives of
the present work is to enable integration with existing controllers, in this
case Valve Index controllers, and to propose an alternative approach to
managing thermal stimulation with Peltier modules by controlling heat flow
instead of temperature. We introduce StimulHeat as a wireless, low power
thermal feedback system, based on the continuous relationship between heat and
current injection in thermoelectric device (TED). First, we designed an
optimized TED driver capable of injecting a continuous, bidirectional current
into the TED, thereby driving it as a heater or cooler. Subsequently, this
driver was implemented in an electronic board to include temperature and heat
flow control loops, as well as Bluetooth Low Energy interface for remote
control. A mechanical integration was conducted, in the form of a controller
extension which is non-intrusive and can be clipped to Valve Index controllers
to enclose the TED, temperature sensors and electronics. Finally, we present a
user study validating StimulHeat for use in Virtual Reality, utilizing a
Unity-built virtual environment with our open-source package.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most successful modern control
methods. It relies on repeatedly solving a finite-horizon optimal control
problem and applying the beginning piece of the optimal input. In this paper,
we develop a modular framework for improving efficiency and robustness of
quantum optimal control (QOC) via MPC. We first provide a tutorial introduction
to basic concepts of MPC from a QOC perspective. We then present multiple MPC
schemes, ranging from simple approaches to more sophisticated schemes which
admit stability guarantees. This yields a modular framework which can be used
1) to improve efficiency of open-loop QOC and 2) to improve robustness of
closed-loop quantum control by incorporating feedback. We demonstrate these
benefits with numerical results, where we benchmark the proposed methods
against competing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反馈线性化(FBL)虽然能将非线性系统转换为线性系统，但对于有状态约束的问题，原始系统的简单状态约束在FBL后变为复杂的非线性约束，反而增加了控制难度。

Method: 提出在应用FBL之前先对系统动态进行增强以捕获状态约束，虽然这会导致在状态约束边界处出现相对阶不定义的问题，但通过使用切换FBL控制器来克服这一挑战。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能够在FBL框架内有效处理状态约束，保持了线性化的优势同时避免了约束复杂化。

Conclusion: 通过系统动态增强和切换控制器的结合，成功解决了FBL在处理状态约束时面临的约束复杂化问题，为有约束非线性系统的控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Feedback Linearisation (FBL) is a widely used technique that applies feedback
laws to transform input-affine nonlinear dynamical systems into linear
dynamical systems, allowing for the use of linear controller design methods
such as pole placement. However, for problems with state constraints,
controlling the linear system induced by FBL can be more challenging than
controlling the original system. This is because simple state constraints in
the original nonlinear system become complex nonlinear constraints in the FBL
induced linearised system, thereby diminishing the advantages of linearisation.
To avoid increasing the complexity of state constraints under FBL, this paper
introduces a method to first augment system dynamics to capture state
constraints before applying FBL. We show that our proposed augmentation method
leads to ill-defined relative degrees at state constraint boundaries. However,
we show that ill-defined relative degrees can be overcome by using a switching
FBL controller. Numerical experiments illustrate the capabilities of this
method for handling state constraints within the FBL framework.
