### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机性补丁过滤的少样本学习方法（SPFF），用于解决食物图像分类中因视觉复杂性和多样性导致的误分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物图像的视觉复杂性和多样性（如不同装饰、光照和视角）导致少样本学习模型难以聚焦关键特征，从而误分类。

Method: SPFF通过随机过滤补丁嵌入，保留与类别表示相关性高的补丁，并使用相似性矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像的关系。

Result: 在Food-101、VireoFood-172和UECFood-256基准测试中，SPFF表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPFF能有效聚焦食物类别特征，过滤无关补丁，提升少样本分类性能。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

### [2] [Puppeteer: Rig and Animate Your 3D Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10898)
*Chaoyue Song,Xiu Li,Fan Yang,Zhongcong Xu,Jiacheng Wei,Fayao Liu,Jiashi Feng,Guosheng Lin,Jianfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer是一个自动化3D模型绑定和动画生成的框架，通过预测骨骼结构和优化动画流程，显著提升了效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代交互应用需要动态3D内容，但静态模型到动画的转换依赖专家干预，成为内容创作的瓶颈。

Method: 系统使用自回归变换器预测骨骼结构，结合注意力架构推断蒙皮权重，并通过可微分优化生成动画。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，方法在骨骼预测和蒙皮质量上显著优于现有技术，且能处理多样化的3D内容。

Conclusion: Puppeteer解决了3D动画生成的自动化问题，提供了高效、高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: DINOv3在多种视觉任务中表现优异，显著超越现有自监督和弱监督基础模型。

Conclusion: DINOv3为视觉任务提供了可扩展的解决方案，推动了自监督学习的发展。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变形攻击检测是确保人脸识别系统可靠性的关键，本文旨在通过多模态学习提供可理解的文本描述。

Method: 采用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）框架，设计了十种文本提示，并在公开数据集上进行了广泛实验。

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [5] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉语言模型的可解释甲骨文破译方法，结合部首分析和象形语义理解，显著提升了零样本破译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文因其稀有性、抽象性和象形多样性，破译难度大，现有深度学习方法忽视字形与语义的关联，导致泛化性和可解释性不足。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略，从部首识别到象形分析，设计部首-象形双重匹配机制，并构建了包含47,157个汉字的象形破译数据集。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到Top-10准确率，零样本破译能力优异，并提供逻辑分析过程。

Conclusion: 该方法为未破译甲骨文提供考古参考，具有数字人文和历史研究的应用潜力。

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的自动标记方法，用于TBDXA扫描，准确率达99.5%，并用于研究身体组成与健康标记的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBDXA扫描是一种低成本全身成像技术，但手动标记关键点耗时且易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用1,683个手动标注的TBDXA扫描训练深度学习模型，并在外部测试集上验证其准确性。

Result: 模型在外部测试集上达到99.5%的关键点正确率，并成功用于分析35,928次扫描的健康标记关联。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅验证了现有健康标记与身体组成的关系，还提出了新假设，为相关研究提供了工具支持。

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [7] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多模态融合方法MANGO，通过可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新的交叉注意力机制，实现了显式、可解释的多模态学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制，难以捕捉模态间的本质特征和复杂关联。

Method: 提出可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新机制（MMCA、IMCA、LICA），构建基于Normalizing Flow的模型。

Result: 在语义分割、图像翻译和电影分类任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MANGO方法显式且高效地捕捉多模态数据的复杂关联，性能优越。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [8] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结合少量真实图像与合成图像是否能提升西瓜病害分类模型的性能，发现混合使用显著提高了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型在农业中生成高分辨率合成图像，但缺乏对结合真实与合成图像效果的研究。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-L模型，比较五种训练数据集（纯真实、纯合成、不同比例混合及增加随机图像）。

Result: 混合数据集（H3-H4）显著提升了F1分数（从0.65到1.00），表明少量真实图像与大量合成图像的结合效果最佳。

Conclusion: 合成图像无法完全替代真实图像，需混合使用以优化作物病害分类模型性能。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [9] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于合成数据的框架，用于提升大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业泄漏检测等安全关键领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私、数据敏感性和事件罕见性，真实数据稀缺，传统微调方法在工业场景中不可行。

Method: 通过高质量合成数据生成管道，结合参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，提升VLMs和目标检测器的性能。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了VLMs和检测器（如YOLO、DETR）的性能，使其在未见泄漏场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据是解决安全关键领域数据稀缺问题的有效途径，结合轻量级适配方法，为工业环境提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [10] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）是一种新兴的视图合成方法，具有快速训练/渲染和高质量视觉效果的优点。本文提出了一种名为EntropyGS的因子化和参数化熵编码方法，用于压缩3DGS高斯属性，实现了约30倍的比特率降低，同时保持相似的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS的高斯创建和视图渲染任务通常需要在不同时间或设备上分离，因此高斯属性的存储/传输和压缩成为必要。本文旨在通过分析高斯属性的统计特性，提出高效的压缩方法。

Method: 首先对3DGS高斯属性进行相关性和统计分析，发现球谐AC属性遵循拉普拉斯分布，而旋转、缩放和不透明度可用高斯混合模型近似。基于此，提出了一种因子化和参数化的熵编码方法EntropyGS，根据属性类型自适应量化。

Result: EntropyGS在基准数据集上实现了约30倍的比特率降低，同时保持与输入3DGS数据相似的渲染质量，且编码和解码时间快速。

Conclusion: EntropyGS是一种高效的3DGS高斯属性压缩方法，通过统计分析和自适应熵编码，显著降低了存储和传输需求，同时保持了高质量的渲染效果。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Conclusion: 展示了基础模型和多模态融合在解析复杂组织生态系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

TL;DR: MRFD是一种无需训练的解码方法，通过多区域融合减少视觉语言模型的幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中因区域信息验证能力不足导致的幻觉问题。

Method: 利用交叉注意力识别显著区域，生成初始响应，基于Jensen-Shannon散度计算可靠性权重，并通过一致性感知融合预测。

Result: 实验表明，MRFD显著减少幻觉并提高事实性，无需模型更新。

Conclusion: MRFD是一种有效的解码方法，可提升视觉语言模型的区域一致性表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于外观的视线估计（PoG）在个体差异和头部姿态变化下的鲁棒性问题，提出了动态校准策略以提高估计器的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PoG估计器因个体差异和头部姿态变化而表现不佳，需改进校准策略以提高准确性。

Method: 构建MobilePoG基准数据集，分析校准点和头部姿态多样性对估计精度的影响，提出动态校准策略。

Result: 实验表明，校准过程中引入更多头部姿态变化可提升估计器的鲁棒性，动态校准策略优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 动态校准策略能有效减少PoG估计器对头部姿态变化的敏感性，提升用户体验和估计精度。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的TAS框架，结合三维特性和语义过程，用于花样滑冰跳跃动作识别，并展示了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 花样滑冰跳跃识别需要专业知识，现有TAS方法因数据不足和忽略三维特性而受限。

Method: 提出VIFSS方法，结合对比学习和动作分类，并构建FS-Jump3D数据集；引入细粒度标注方案。

Result: 方法在元素级TAS上达到92% F1@50，且在数据有限时表现优异。

Conclusion: 框架有效解决了现有TAS的局限性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相位一致性加权最小绝对偏差（PCWLAD）的亚像素模板匹配方法，用于提高多模态光学图像的匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态光学图像匹配受非线性辐射和几何变形差异影响，导致匹配精度下降。

Method: 方法包括粗匹配（使用SSIM）和细匹配（使用WLAD），并结合相位一致性和结构滤波。

Result: 在三种数据集上测试，PCWLAD在匹配正确率和RMSE上优于现有方法，平均匹配精度约0.4像素。

Conclusion: PCWLAD方法在多模态图像匹配中表现出色，软件和数据集已公开。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将单人及多人动态分开处理，无法捕捉真实场景中的自然交互和协调。

Method: InterSyn包含两个模块：INS模块联合建模单人及交互行为，REC模块优化角色间的动态协调。

Result: 实验表明，InterSyn生成的动作序列在文本对齐性和多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InterSyn为自然动作合成设定了新基准，未来将开源代码以促进研究。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

Conclusion: 讨论了未来研究方向，强调了OoD分割在提升系统鲁棒性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Conclusion: 综述总结了强化学习与生成模型交叉领域的开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Conclusion: 强调了指令选择中概念知识与视觉技能权衡的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Motivation: 当前研究多关注单一超微结构识别，难以满足实际诊断需求，需同时量化多种特征。

Method: 基于三个深度学习模型：超微结构分割、肾小球滤过屏障区域分类和电子致密沉积物检测模型。

Result: 在115名患者中验证，自动量化结果与病理报告一致，具备高精度和高通量特性。

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Conclusion: SpaRC-AD在安全关键场景中表现出色，证明了雷达融合在精确运动理解和长时程轨迹预测中的有效性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过共同生成图像及其对应的场景内在属性（如深度、分割图）来提升图像空间一致性和真实性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型因缺乏对场景结构和空间布局的充分信息，常产生空间不一致和扭曲的图像。

Method: 利用预训练估计器从图像数据集中提取场景内在属性，并通过自编码器将其聚合为单一潜变量；基于预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM），同时去噪图像和内在属性域，共享信息以保持一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能纠正空间不一致性，生成更自然的场景布局，同时保持基础模型（如Stable Diffusion）的保真度和文本对齐。

Conclusion: 通过共同生成图像和内在属性，模型能隐式捕捉场景结构，生成更一致和真实的图像。

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

TL;DR: NSegment+是一种新的数据增强框架，通过解耦图像和标签变换，处理语义分割中的隐式标签噪声，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集中的隐式标签噪声（如模糊边界和标注者差异）会影响模型性能，传统数据增强方法可能放大这些问题。

Method: NSegment+仅对标签施加弹性变形，保持图像不变，从而学习对标签不一致的鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上（Vaihingen、LoveDA等），NSegment+平均提升mIoU达1.75至3.39。

Conclusion: 处理隐式标签噪声对提升语义分割性能至关重要，NSegment+是一种有效方法。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于姿态驱动的质量控制数据增强框架（PQ-DAF），通过扩散模型和视觉语言模型提升少样本驾驶员分心检测的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在真实场景中泛化能力不足，主要因数据标注成本高和训练与部署域差异大。

Method: 使用渐进条件扩散模型（PCDMs）生成多样训练样本，并通过视觉语言模型（CogVLM）过滤低质量样本。

Result: 实验表明PQ-DAF显著提升了少样本条件下的模型泛化性能。

Conclusion: PQ-DAF为数据稀缺场景下的驾驶员分心检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

### [31] [Translation of Text Embedding via Delta Vector to Suppress Strongly Entangled Content in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10407)
*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过修改文本嵌入空间中的向量来抑制扩散模型中与特定词汇强关联的内容，显著提升了生成图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中特定词汇与内容强关联的问题（如生成‘查理·卓别林’时无法避免‘胡子’）。

Method: 引入delta向量修改文本嵌入，并通过零样本方法获取该向量；进一步提出SSDV方法，将delta向量融入交叉注意力机制，优化个性化模型中的抑制效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性指标上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效抑制了不必要内容的生成，提升了图像生成的精确性和可控性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SC-Lane是一种新颖的3D车道检测框架，通过动态融合多坡度特征和保持时间一致性，显著提升了高度图估计的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定坡度锚点，难以适应多样化的道路几何形状，因此需要一种更灵活且鲁棒的高度图估计方法。

Method: 提出Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature模块动态预测权重，融合多坡度特征；Height Consistency模块确保时间一致性。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中，SC-Lane以64.3%的F-score达到最优性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-Lane通过动态坡度适应和时间一致性，为3D车道检测提供了更鲁棒和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

TL;DR: NanoControl提出了一种高效的可控文本到图像生成方法，通过低秩适应模块和KV-Context增强机制，显著减少了计算开销和参数增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DiTs的可控文本到图像生成方法依赖ControlNet范式，导致参数和计算成本过高。

Method: 采用Flux作为主干网络，设计LoRA风格的控制模块和KV-Context增强机制。

Result: NanoControl仅增加0.024%参数和0.029% GFLOPs，实现了高效可控生成。

Conclusion: NanoControl在减少计算开销的同时保持了生成质量和可控性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA是一个大规模视觉问答数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空推理，填补了现有视觉语言模型在动态场景理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基于静态图像文本对训练，无法满足动态交通场景的精确时空推理需求。

Method: 构建STRIDE-QA数据集，包含100小时多传感器驾驶数据，提供1600万QA对和285K帧图像，支持对象中心和自我中心推理。

Result: 微调后的视觉语言模型在空间定位和未来运动预测上表现显著提升（55%和28%），而通用模型接近零分。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA为开发更可靠的自动驾驶视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Result: 在YouTube-VIS数据集上表现优异，显著优于现有方法，避免了灾难性遗忘并提升了分割和分类性能。

Conclusion: CRISP为持续视频实例分割提供了一种有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD-SA有效解决了双模态标注的高成本问题，同时提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Conclusion: 该方法降低了CAD系统的依赖和人工标注成本，支持建筑行业中小企业的数字化转型，促进标准化和可持续发展。

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Result: V1-like层在图像失真任务中与人类感知判断相关性最高，且对中等噪声、模糊和稀疏性表现最佳。

Conclusion: 视觉系统可能针对特定失真水平优化，生物启发模型可无监督学习感知度量。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

Motivation: 现有在线视频超分辨率方法仅利用相邻前一帧进行时间对齐，限制了长时视频建模能力。SSMs具有线性计算复杂度和全局感受野，可提升效率和性能。

Method: TS-Mamba通过构建视频轨迹选择相似token，利用轨迹感知移位Mamba聚合模块（TSMA）进行信息聚合，设计了基于Hilbert扫描的移位SSMs块以增强空间连续性。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的VSR测试数据集上，TS-Mamba在大多数情况下优于六种基准模型，且计算复杂度降低22.7%（以MACs计）。

Conclusion: TS-Mamba通过长时轨迹建模和低复杂度Mamba实现了高效时空信息聚合，性能优越且计算复杂度低。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Conclusion: 领域随机化与自编码器质量控制结合，可显著减少标记数据需求，推动新解剖结构或成像技术研究。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TweezeEdit是一种无需调优和反转的图像编辑框架，通过正则化整个去噪路径而非依赖反转锚点，实现高效的语义保留和目标对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编辑图像时过度依赖目标提示，导致源图像语义保留不足且编辑路径冗长。

Method: TweezeEdit通过梯度驱动正则化，在一致性模型的指导下，直接注入目标提示语义，缩短编辑路径。

Result: 实验表明，TweezeEdit在语义保留和目标对齐上优于现有方法，仅需12步（1.6秒/次），适合实时应用。

Conclusion: TweezeEdit提供了一种高效、一致的图像编辑方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅技术在场景优化中缺乏几何约束，导致高频纹理和锐利不连续区域的模糊重建。

Method: 通过自适应混合四重子样本计算像素颜色，并引入动态梯度分析的权重策略和梯度差分约束。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的细节保留效果，同时在实时渲染效率上保持优异表现。

Conclusion: 该方法在结构相似性（SSIM）和感知质量（LPIPS）上均显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP-5M数据集和Med-GLIP框架为医学图像定位提供了统一且可推广的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

Motivation: 遥感图像中显著目标检测面临目标尺度变化大和对比度低的挑战，现有方法难以有效整合全局和局部特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，GCRPNet在性能上达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: GCRPNet通过结合长程依赖和区域特征增强，显著提升了显著目标检测的效果。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PSScreen通过创新的特征学习和对齐方法，有效解决了多数据集训练中的挑战，提升了疾病筛查的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法因依赖有限且不匹配的异常样本而性能不佳，需要更有效的语义监督。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，RAP将FPR95降低7.05%，AUROC提高1.71%，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAP通过动态检索增强提示，显著提升了OOD检测性能，验证了其模块和动机的有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

Result: 在多种3D感知任务中表现优于QAT，检测、分割和占用预测任务均有提升，同时减少微调权重。

Conclusion: PTQAT是一种通用高效量化方法，平衡性能与资源消耗，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

Conclusion: HM-Talker通过混合运动表示和身份无关学习，显著提升了说话头部视频的生成效果。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

TL;DR: HumanSense是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在人类中心场景下感知和交互能力的基准，发现现有模型在复杂交互任务中仍有改进空间，并提出多阶段强化学习提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs缺乏细粒度评估框架，难以满足人类中心场景的需求，如理解复杂意图和提供共情反馈。

Method: 引入HumanSense基准，结合视觉、音频和文本输入，采用多阶段强化学习增强推理能力。

Result: 补充多模态输入显著提升性能，Omni模型表现更优；推理能力是关键，强化学习带来显著改进。

Conclusion: HumanSense为MLLMs提供评估框架，强调推理能力的重要性，并提出无训练方法提升非推理模型性能。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

TL;DR: EvTurb利用事件流解耦大气湍流中的模糊和倾斜效应，通过两步网络实现高效湍流去除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致图像模糊和几何倾斜，现有方法难以处理其复杂性。

Method: 提出EvTurb框架，通过事件积分减少模糊，利用方差图消除倾斜。

Result: 实验表明EvTurb优于现有方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: EvTurb为湍流去除提供了新思路，并发布了首个真实数据集TurbEvent。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的自动驾驶系统易受对抗补丁攻击，现有黑盒攻击方法因评价指标和低分辨率数据限制，实际攻击效果不佳。

Method: 提出PASR指标和LCSL损失函数，结合PSPP数据预处理，优化高分辨率数据集的攻击效果。

Result: P$^3$A在未见模型和高分辨率数据集上优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: P$^3$A框架显著提升了对抗补丁攻击的实际效果和可迁移性。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级上采样模块FGA，通过傅里叶特征和注意力机制提升超分辨率重建的高频细节，减少伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法（如子像素卷积）在重建高频细节时表现不佳且易引入伪影，FGA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FGA结合了傅里叶特征MLP、跨分辨率相关注意力层和频域L1损失，以提升高频细节和频谱一致性。

Result: 实验显示FGA在五种超分辨率骨干网络中平均PSNR提升0.12~0.14 dB，频谱一致性提升29%，尤其在纹理丰富数据集上效果显著。

Conclusion: FGA是一种高效、可扩展的上采样替代方案，能有效减少伪影并保留细节。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

TL;DR: FIND-Net是一种新型金属伪影减少（MAR）框架，结合频域和空间域处理，显著减少伪影并保留结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属植入物在CT成像中产生的高密度伪影严重影响图像质量，现有深度学习方法难以同时抑制伪影和保留结构细节。

Method: FIND-Net集成了快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）层和可训练高斯滤波，将MAR视为频域和空间域的混合任务。

Result: 在合成数据集上，FIND-Net在MAE、SSIM和PSNR上均优于现有方法；在真实临床CT扫描中也表现出色。

Conclusion: FIND-Net在MAR任务中表现出优越性能，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Chamfer Guidance的无训练指导方法，通过少量真实样本提升生成图像的多样性和质量，并在下游任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前条件图像生成模型在生成质量上的进步牺牲了多样性，限制了其作为合成训练数据的实用性。

Method: 利用少量真实样本（如2或32张）通过Chamfer Guidance方法优化生成数据的质量和多样性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和地理多样性基准测试中，生成质量保持或提升的同时多样性显著增加，下游分类任务准确率提升高达15-16%。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著提升了生成数据的实用性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

TL;DR: ChatENV是一个交互式视觉语言模型，结合卫星图像和传感器数据，用于环境监测和分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型忽视环境传感器的因果信号，依赖单一来源的标注，缺乏交互式场景推理能力。

Method: 构建包含177k图像的数据集，使用GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0标注，并基于Qwen-2.5-VL模型进行微调。

Result: 在时间和假设推理任务中表现优异（BERT-F1 0.903），优于现有时间模型。

Conclusion: ChatENV是一个强大的、基于传感器的环境监测工具。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Method: 分析图像采集过程中的参数和细微变换，研究这些参数如何被编码到视觉表示中，并评估其对语义预测的影响。

Result: 发现这些参数会被系统性地编码到视觉表示中，且对语义预测有显著影响，具体效果取决于参数与语义标签的相关性。

Conclusion: 视觉编码器对图像采集参数和细微变换敏感，这种敏感性可能对语义预测产生积极或消极的影响。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Conclusion: 结合姿态估计和BLSTM的方法高效且准确，适用于小数据集和短序列。

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

Conclusion: SemPT通过属性级知识共享和动态推理策略，显著提升了视觉迁移学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Conclusion: 通过跨视图对齐和两阶段训练，AddressVLM显著提升了细粒度地址定位的性能。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

Conclusion: HyperTea首次将CNN、RNN和HGNN结合用于红外小目标检测，显著提升性能。

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种联合重建多回波时间（TE）数据的方法，用于胎儿脑MRI的T2映射，以减少运动伪影和扫描时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑MRI的T2映射在0.55T中场强下具有潜力，但现有方法因运动伪影和长扫描时间而受限。

Method: 结合隐式神经表示和物理约束正则化，联合重建多TE数据，共享信息并保持解剖和定量T2保真度。

Result: 在模拟胎儿脑和成人数据集上表现优异，并首次展示了0.55T下的胎儿T2映射结果。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了每个TE所需的扫描次数，为胎儿脑T2映射提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LVLM的FS-IAD方法缺乏工业知识和推理能力，无法媲美专业质检员。

Result: IADGPT在异常检测、定位和推理任务中表现优异，实验验证其性能提升。

Conclusion: IADGPT框架为解决FS-IAD任务提供了有效方法，未来将公开数据集。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级视图转换框架TUNet，利用预训练扩散模型生成高质量新视角图像，解决了现有方法模糊和泛化差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张图像合成新视角是一个挑战性任务，现有方法需要微调或从头训练扩散模型，成本高且效果不佳。

Method: 使用相机姿态条件化的U-Net（TUNet）预测目标视角的潜在表示，并提出融合策略以保留细节。

Result: 在MVImgNet上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能高效利用预训练扩散模型，生成高质量新视角图像。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合事件相机和RGB相机的方法（MCFNet），通过动态范围信息和运动线索融合，提升复杂交通环境下的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在复杂光照条件下动态范围受限，导致全局对比度降低和高频细节丢失，影响目标检测效果。

Method: 提出MCFNet，包括事件校正模块（ECM）、事件动态上采样模块（EDUM）和跨模态融合模块（CMM），实现时空对齐和自适应特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，MCFNet显著优于现有方法，mAP50提升7.4%，mAP提升1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet通过多模态融合有效解决了复杂光照下的目标检测问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CountCluster的方法，通过优化对象交叉注意力图在早期时间步的聚类，以更准确地生成符合输入提示中对象数量的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在生成图像时难以准确反映输入提示中指定的对象数量，尤其是在早期时间步的结构特征被忽视。

Method: CountCluster方法在推理时根据注意力分数将对象交叉注意力图划分为k个聚类，定义理想分布并优化潜在变量以对齐目标分布。

Result: 该方法在对象数量准确性上平均提升了18.5%，并在多种提示下表现出优越的数量控制性能。

Conclusion: CountCluster无需外部工具或额外训练，有效提升了扩散模型生成图像中对象数量的准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

Conclusion: 神经网络方法可有效解决卫星资源限制，实现实时SAR数据处理与目标分类。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Conclusion: 该框架通过改进跨视角图像匹配，为跨视角定位提供了更准确和可解释的解决方案，并推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Result: DCPE加速了LlamaGen-B的训练速度42%，并提升了FID和IS性能。

Conclusion: DCPE是一种即插即用的方法，能有效利用代码本先验信息，提升自回归模型的训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Motivation: 现有研究局限于日常活动，而实际应用需应对视觉风格和语义内容的域偏移，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 构建EgoCross基准，覆盖四个挑战性领域，包含约1000个QA对，支持OpenQA和CloseQA格式，并进行实验验证。

Result: 多数现有模型在非日常生活领域泛化能力不足，但通过微调和强化学习等方法可能改进。

Conclusion: EgoCross为推进域自适应、鲁棒的自我中心视频理解提供了基础，数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

TL;DR: DARC是一种新型模型驱动的群配准框架，用于高效构建无偏、高保真的3D图谱，并支持多种应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动方法在大规模3D数据集上存在局限性，而模型驱动方法虽理论扎实但面临可扩展性问题，DARC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DARC采用坐标下降策略和中心性激活函数，支持多种图像差异度量，高效处理任意数量的3D图像。

Result: DARC生成了无偏、高保真的图谱，并在一次性分割和形状合成应用中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DARC为图谱构建及其应用提供了灵活、通用且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

TL;DR: 论文分析了主流视觉语言模型在时空物理推理任务上的不足，并提出了一种结合监督微调和规则强化学习的方法，显著提升了模型性能，但泛化能力仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空物理推理是理解现实物理世界的基础能力，但现有视觉语言模型在此任务上的表现尚未充分探索，亟需改进。

Method: 采用监督微调结合规则强化学习的方法对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行优化。

Result: 优化后的模型在时空物理推理任务上表现显著提升，超越了主流专有模型。

Conclusion: 尽管模型性能有所提升，但其在新物理场景下的泛化能力仍有限，需要进一步研究新方法。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个新的大规模基准数据集，专注于检测高度真实和语义复杂的AI生成视频，填补了现有检测方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的超真实视频对社会信任和数字完整性构成严重威胁，现有检测基准在真实性、规模和复杂性上不足。

Method: AEGIS包含10,000多个精心筛选的真实和合成视频，涵盖多种先进生成模型，并提供多模态注释。

Result: 实验表明，现有视觉语言模型在AEGIS最具挑战性的子集上检测能力有限。

Conclusion: AEGIS为开发更鲁棒、可靠的视频真实性检测方法提供了关键基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

TL;DR: BLADE是一种创新的联合训练框架，通过自适应块稀疏注意力机制和稀疏感知的步蒸馏方法，显著加速视频生成模型的推理速度，同时提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高质量视频生成中表现优异，但其迭代去噪过程慢且长序列的二次注意力成本高，导致推理瓶颈。现有加速策略难以有效结合。

Method: 提出BLADE框架，包括自适应块稀疏注意力机制（ASA）和基于轨迹分布匹配（TDM）的稀疏感知步蒸馏方法。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Wan2.1-1.3B模型上，BLADE分别实现8.89x和14.10x的加速，且VBench-2.0评分显著提升。

Conclusion: BLADE有效解决了视频生成模型的推理瓶颈，同时提升了生成质量，为高效高质量视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

Method: 设计TriFlowSR框架，明确实现LR与参考HR图像的模式匹配，并引入Landmark-4K数据集。

Result: 实验表明，TriFlowSR能更有效利用参考HR图像的语义和纹理信息。

Conclusion: TriFlowSR是首个针对UHD地标场景的扩散式RefSR方法，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Motivation: 现有被动活体检测方法在区分真实面部与多种攻击（如照片、屏幕显示、面具和视频重放）时效果有限，需要更主动且鲁棒的方法。

Method: 设计了用户交互场景，要求参与者缓慢将面部靠近摄像头，结合光流分析和神经网络分类器处理RGB帧和光流数据。

Result: 该方法通过提取面部体积信息，显著提高了对真实面部与攻击的区分能力。

Conclusion: 提出的交互式光流分析方法在活体检测中表现出更高的可靠性，优于传统被动方法。

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对X射线血管造影的自监督学习方法VasoMIM，通过结合血管解剖知识改进传统MIM，显著提升了血管分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线血管造影中血管分割的准确性对临床应用至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且传统MIM方法因类别不平衡难以捕捉血管解剖结构。

Method: VasoMIM框架包含解剖引导的掩蔽策略和解剖一致性损失，前者优先掩蔽血管区域，后者增强血管语义一致性。

Result: 在三个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VasoMIM为X射线血管造影分析提供了有效解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

Method: 提出OF-Diff方法，首次基于布局提取对象先验形状，并引入双分支扩散模型和扩散一致性损失，无需真实图像即可生成高保真图像。此外，使用DDPO优化扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明，OF-Diff在关键质量指标上优于现有方法，多态和小目标类别的性能显著提升（如飞机、船只和车辆的mAP分别提高8.3%、7.7%和4.0%）。

Conclusion: OF-Diff通过改进对象保真度和多样性，为高精度遥感图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand

Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks

balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more

Conclusion: 该方法在遮挡和非遮挡区域均提升了预测性能，具有强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: AdaptFED扩展了焦点调制在联邦学习中的应用，为自适应、可扩展和泛化的基于Transformer的联邦系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有视频生成技术难以满足物理规律的要求，限制了真实感和准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为更真实、符合人类偏好的视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

TL;DR: ToonComposer是一个生成模型，将中间帧生成和上色统一为一个阶段，通过稀疏草图注入和卡通适配方法提升效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卡通和动漫制作需要大量手动工作，现有AI方法分阶段处理导致错误累积和伪影。

Method: ToonComposer结合稀疏草图注入和空间低秩适配器，利用现代视频基础模型，支持单草图和多草图输入。

Result: ToonComposer在视觉质量、运动一致性和生产效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ToonComposer为AI辅助卡通制作提供了更高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

TL;DR: STream3R是一种基于Transformer的3D重建方法，通过流式框架和因果注意力处理图像序列，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图重建方法依赖昂贵的全局优化或简单的内存机制，难以处理长序列或动态场景。

Method: 采用解码器-only Transformer，结合因果注意力和几何先验，实现高效流式处理。

Result: 在静态和动态场景基准测试中表现优异，兼容LLM式训练基础设施。

Conclusion: 展示了因果Transformer模型在实时3D感知中的潜力。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在遥感领域具有潜力，但需针对地球观测数据的独特特性进行适配。

Method: 提出了MAESTRO方法，基于掩码自编码器，优化了融合策略和目标归一化方案，并引入光谱先验作为自监督信号。

Result: 在四个地球观测数据集上评估，MAESTRO在多时相动态任务中达到新SOTA，同时在单时相任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MAESTRO为遥感数据的自监督学习提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ESSENTIAL方法，通过结合情景记忆和语义记忆解决视频类增量学习中的记忆效率与性能权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频类增量学习方法在记忆效率和性能之间存在矛盾，要么存储密集样本导致内存不足，要么存储稀疏样本牺牲性能。

Method: ESSENTIAL结合情景记忆（存储稀疏特征）和语义记忆（存储可学习提示），通过新型记忆检索模块整合两者，实现从稀疏特征中提取密集特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，ESSENTIAL显著减少内存占用同时保持优异性能。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL有效平衡了记忆效率和性能，为视频类增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨领域模型依赖领域特定组件和多阶段训练，限制了实用性和扩展性。本文旨在通过单阶段训练构建统一模型。

Method: 提出Pose-in-Context (PiC)和Human-in-Context (HiC)，后者结合姿态与网格表示，采用最大-最小相似性提示采样策略和双分支上下文注入网络架构。

Result: HiC在泛化能力、数据规模和性能上优于PiC，展示了统一跨领域模型的潜力。

Conclusion: HiC为构建灵活且可扩展的统一跨领域3D人体运动模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子隐式神经表示（QINR）在架构设计、量子力学特性利用和训练效率等方面仍存在挑战。本文旨在通过QVF解决这些问题，并探索其在视觉和几何学习中的潜力。

Method: QVF使用神经振幅编码将数据嵌入量子态向量，采用全纠缠的可学习参数化量子电路设计，并在实希尔伯特空间中执行量子操作，确保训练稳定性和快速收敛。

Result: 实验证明，QVF在视觉表示精度上优于现有量子方法和经典基线，尤其在高频细节学习方面表现突出。

Conclusion: QVF为量子隐式神经表示提供了一种高效稳定的新方法，展示了在2D和3D视觉任务中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

TL;DR: MAGUS是一个模块化框架，通过解耦的认知和决策阶段统一多模态理解与生成，支持灵活扩展和高性能跨模态转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在整合自回归语言模型和扩散模型时的灵活性和可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用多智能体协作的模块化设计，分为认知阶段（Perceiver、Planner、Reflector）和决策阶段（Growth-Aware Search机制）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越GPT-4o等强基线。

Conclusion: MAGUS为多模态任务提供了一种无需联合训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

Method: 基于公开数据（2020-21至2023-24赛季），开发位置特定的集成模型。

Result: OpenFPL在2024-25赛季测试中表现媲美商业服务，且在高回报球员预测上更优。

Conclusion: OpenFPL为玩家提供长期和短期规划支持，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Conclusion: xRFM是一种高效且可解释的表格数据预测方法，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球普遍缺乏体育活动的问题，探索移动健康（mHealth）干预的潜力，尤其是基于行为科学的个性化干预。

Method: 13,463名Fitbit用户随机分为四组：对照组（无干预）、随机组（随机选择干预）、固定组（基于预设逻辑干预）和RL组（基于RL算法干预）。

Result: RL组在1个月和2个月时的步数显著高于其他组，且效果持续。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于行为科学的RL算法可以规模化地个性化数字健康干预，有效提升体育活动水平。

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

Motivation: 需求计划者更重视预测的稳定性和一致性，而非仅追求准确性提升。模型预测的剧烈波动会增加人工干预，降低对ML模型的信任。

Method: 通过案例研究评估Chronos、DeepAR等先进模型在M5和Favorita数据集上的稳定性和准确性，重点关注集成模型的表现。

Result: 集成模型在保持或提升准确性的同时显著提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: 建议进一步研究生产系统中模型预测的稳定性问题，强调稳定性与准确性的平衡。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Motivation: 当前CAD工作流程需要大量领域专业知识和手动建模，而大型语言模型（LLM）为自动化参数化3D建模提供了新机会，但直接将设计意图转化为可执行CAD代码仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出CAD-RL框架，结合CoT冷启动和目标驱动的强化学习后训练，采用三种任务特定奖励，并引入三种优化策略以稳定学习。

Conclusion: CAD-RL为自动化CAD建模提供了高效解决方案，并通过ExeCAD数据集支持训练和基准测试。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT通过优化计算效率，为LLM在复杂推理任务中的强化微调提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

Result: 提出的方法在保持通用性的同时，显著提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: 方差缩减技术是提高多目标强化学习样本效率的有效方法，适用于复杂决策场景。

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Conclusion: EM算法在过拟合模型中的行为与初始权重密切相关，且总体和有限样本结果存在直观联系。

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Conclusion: 有影响力的基准测试可作为训练课程，其新颖性是衡量推理模型泛化能力的关键，从而推动AI发展。

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Result: D-Wave采样覆盖更多局部谷，但与Gibbs采样重叠较少；未显著提升采样质量，但显示出潜在改进空间。

Conclusion: D-Wave采样未显著改善RBM训练，但结合经典与量子方法可能有潜力。

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

Motivation: 肝硬化患者AKI发生率高且预后差，现有预测工具准确性不足且难以与ICU工作流程结合。

Method: 回顾性分析MIMIC-IV数据库，提取48小时内实验室和生理数据，使用多种算法训练并评估。

Result: LightGBM表现最优（AUROC 0.808），关键预测因子与已知机制一致。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确预测AKI风险，高阴性预测值支持低风险患者安全降级，需进一步外部验证。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Conclusion: ICL在密码函数学习中表现出色，为Transformer模型的归纳能力和泛化性提供了新的验证。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

*Lisa Haxel,Jaivardhan Kapoor,Ulf Ziemann,Jakob H. Macke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT框架通过持续适应模型消除脑机接口（BCI）的校准需求，结合群体预训练和在线微调，显著提升解码精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑机接口因神经信号漂移和用户差异导致的精度下降问题，减少频繁校准的需求。

Method: EDAPT框架先通过多用户数据训练基线解码器，再通过监督微调持续个性化模型。

Result: 在三个BCI任务的九个数据集中，EDAPT显著优于静态方法，解码精度随数据总量提升。

Conclusion: EDAPT为免校准BCI提供实用路径，降低部署障碍。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

Conclusion: 该方法充分利用偏移特性，实现了优于现有方法的适应性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

Result: 框架在预测区间覆盖率和长度上优于传统方法，提供了短期精确和长期宽泛的预测。

Conclusion: 通过量化不确定性，该方法支持基于证据的药物剂量决策，优化症状控制并提高生活质量。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

Conclusion: SynBrain揭示了跨试验和被试的功能一致性，其合成信号捕捉了生物神经变异性的可解释模式。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

Motivation: 医疗环境中需要快速适应新任务或疾病，同时保护隐私，FedKEI旨在通过知识转移提升效率。

Method: 采用全局聚类和双层优化方案，学习跨集群和集群内的权重，个性化知识转移。

Result: 在皮肤病、胸部X光和视网膜OCT数据集上，FedKEI优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedKEI能有效适应新疾病，为联邦学习提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: CLIP-Fed结合预聚合和后聚合防御策略，利用多模态大语言模型和频率分析构建服务器数据集，通过原型对比损失和KL散度对齐全局模型与CLIP的知识。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-10-LT上，CLIP-Fed平均降低ASR（2.03%和1.35%），同时提升MA（7.92%和0.48%）。

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed有效解决了异构数据分布下的后门防御问题，显著提升了防御效果和模型性能。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，新方法显著优于现有公平聚类基线。

Conclusion: 福利中心化聚类方法优于传统公平聚类方法，提供了更优的聚类结果。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

Conclusion: eMamba为边缘设备提供了高效的Mamba模型部署方案，兼具性能和资源效率。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Result: 实验验证了所提评估框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为ITL方法提供了标准化评估工具，有助于理解标注者行为。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

Motivation: LLM推理因内存占用和带宽需求大而效率低下，而计算能力的发展远超内存和带宽的提升，因此需要新算法来平衡计算与内存操作。

Method: XQuant量化并缓存层输入激活X，动态重计算Keys和Values，减少内存使用；XQuant-CL进一步利用跨层相似性实现极端压缩。

Result: XQuant实现7.7倍内存节省且困惑度下降<0.1；XQuant-CL实现10倍内存节省且困惑度仅下降0.01。

Conclusion: XQuant通过利用硬件计算能力消除内存瓶颈，超越现有KV缓存量化方法，接近FP16精度。

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SC2Arena基准测试和StarEvolve框架，用于全面评估大型语言模型在复杂决策任务（如《星际争霸II》）中的表现，填补了现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能完全捕捉《星际争霸II》的复杂性（如完整游戏背景、多样化动作空间和所有可玩种族），因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出SC2Arena基准测试，支持所有可玩种族和低层动作空间，并优化文本观察以解决空间推理问题；同时设计StarEvolve框架，采用Planner-Executor-Verifier结构和评分系统，结合高质量游戏数据进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，StarEvolve在战略规划任务中表现优异，SC2Arena为开发通用智能体提供了新见解。

Conclusion: SC2Arena和StarEvolve填补了现有基准测试的不足，为复杂决策任务的研究提供了更全面的工具和方法。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM在过参数化模型中提升泛化能力，但对其在张量化或尺度不变模型中的行为研究不足。本文提出Norm Deviation概念，分析SAM的范数动态，并基于此提出DAS方法，实验证明其性能优于SAM且计算开销更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SAM在更一般的张量化或尺度不变模型中的行为，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入Norm Deviation概念，通过梯度流分析其动态，提出DAS方法显式模拟SAM的隐式正则化行为。

Result: DAS在张量补全、噪声训练、模型压缩和参数高效微调中表现优于SAM，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: DAS通过显式控制范数偏差，有效提升性能并降低计算成本，为优化方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RealAC是一个生成现实且可操作反事实解释的框架，通过自动保持特征间依赖关系并支持用户冻结属性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法通常依赖手工约束或领域知识，难以捕捉复杂非线性关系，且缺乏用户定制化能力。

Method: RealAC通过对齐事实与反事实实例的特征联合分布来保持依赖关系，并允许用户冻结不希望改变的属性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，RealAC在因果性、依赖保持和现实性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RealAC提供了一种因果感知且用户中心的反事实生成解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-Node是一种自解释的图神经网络框架，通过为每个节点生成解释，提高了GNN在医学图像分类中的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的决策过程不透明，限制了其在需要高可信度的临床应用中的使用。现有解释方法多为后验且全局性，无法提供局部推理的细节。

Method: X-Node为每个节点构建结构化上下文向量，包含可解释的线索（如度、中心性等），并通过轻量级Reasoner模块生成解释向量，用于重构嵌入、生成自然语言解释并反馈到GNN中。

Result: 在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST数据集上，X-Node保持了分类准确性，同时生成了可信的节点级解释。

Conclusion: X-Node在保持性能的同时，显著提升了GNN的可解释性，适用于高风险的临床场景。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG是一种联邦图学习框架，通过生成对抗网络和互信息机制解决数据不平衡问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习中，非独立同分布数据和类别不平衡问题会损害模型性能，尤其是少数类别的识别能力。

Method: 提出GraphFedMIG框架，采用分层生成对抗网络，通过互信息机制指导生成器优化，专注于少数类特征生成。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG有效解决了联邦图学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

Motivation: 未观测的混杂因素会干扰因果效应估计，这一问题在推荐系统中因忽略某些特征而同样存在，影响系统性能。

Method: 通过模拟研究和实例分析，探讨了推荐系统中混杂问题的来源及其影响。

Result: 研究发现，常见的推荐系统实践会引入混杂因素，降低系统性能。

Conclusion: 论文建议采取具体措施减少或避免混杂因素对推荐系统的影响。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Motivation: 传统求解器在处理参数化约束优化问题时效率较低，尤其是在批量求解时。$\Pi$net旨在提供一种高效、可靠的替代方案。

Method: $\Pi$net利用算子分裂实现快速前向投影，并通过隐函数定理进行反向传播，确保约束满足。

Conclusion: $\Pi$net为参数化约束优化问题提供了一种高效、可行的解决方案，并在多车辆运动规划中展示了实用性。

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

Result: 通过仅使用图像数据为简单摆系统生成结构化潜在状态空间模型，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更通用的控制算法和估计技术提供了新途径，尤其在机器人领域有广泛应用。

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一的频谱框架，用于分析和量化解释的平滑性、忠实性及其权衡，并量化了ReLU网络对高频信息的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU网络在视觉数据中广泛使用，但其梯度解释存在噪声且难以解释，现有方法（如GradCAM）通过生成替代模型平滑解释，但牺牲了忠实性。

Method: 引入频谱框架，系统分析解释的平滑性与忠实性，并量化ReLU网络对高频信息的贡献，通过正则化方法识别权衡。

Result: 分析表明替代平滑方法会扭曲解释，导致‘解释差距’，并通过实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释的平滑性与忠实性提供了理论基础，并量化了权衡关系。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four

Conclusion: 深度强化学习可以显著提升NMC算法的性能，为解决组合优化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法难以在不重新训练的情况下生成满足任务特定约束的联合相关样本。

Result: 在图像对生成、对象操作和多机器人运动规划中表现出色，耦合效果提升且约束满足。

Conclusion: PCD有效解决了联合生成中的约束问题，计算成本低。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 解决长时程强化学习中奖励稀疏和奖励偏差的问题，特别是在软件工程任务中多轮推理和规则验证的挑战。

Method: 提出SWE-oriented RL Framework，支持多轮交互和Docker执行，并设计G-RA方法，仅在长期奖励满足阈值时累积即时奖励。

Result: 实验显示G-RA显著提升了任务完成率（47.6%→93.8%和22.0%→86.0%）和修改率（19.6%→23.8%和12.0%→42.0%）。

Conclusion: G-RA通过平衡奖励累积解决了长时程强化学习中的奖励偏差问题，为实际应用提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优异的异常检测性能、效率和扩展性。

Conclusion: FreeGAD无需训练即可实现高效、可扩展的图异常检测。

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion: 改进模态融合策略和消除捷径信号对提升多模态讽刺检测性能至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

Result: 在14个基准空间转录组切片上的实验表明，SPHENIC性能优于现有方法3.31%-6.54%。

Conclusion: SPHENIC通过改进拓扑学习和空间嵌入优化，显著提升了空间聚类任务的性能。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土地覆盖变化对地球系统过程有重要影响，但目前预测土地覆盖变化的能力滞后于其他地球系统模型的进展。

Method: 将土地覆盖变化预测视为数据合成问题，利用扩散模型进行十年尺度的不透水面预测，并与基线模型对比。

Result: 在12个大都市区的实验中，模型在分辨率≥0.7×0.7km²时的平均绝对误差（MAE）低于基线模型。

Conclusion: 生成式模型能够从历史数据中捕捉时空模式，为未来土地覆盖变化预测提供可行方法，未来研究将进一步整合地球物理属性和驱动变量。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from

$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when

objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the

MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御措施（如主机补丁和网络过滤）在可扩展性、兼容性和部署过程中存在不足，无法有效应对大规模网络设备中的漏洞威胁。

Method: REFN通过强化学习（RL）驱动在线网络奖励，结合Agentic RAG知识蒸馏和RL From VNF Pipeline，训练LLMs生成网络过滤器，并通过在线验证确保鲁棒性。

Result: 在22类1天或n天漏洞测试中，REFN表现出高效性（准确率提高21.1%）、快速性（平均补丁时间为3.65小时）和可扩展性（支持10K设备）。

Conclusion: REFN为利用LLMs快速预防大规模漏洞利用提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

Method: 利用GPU加速仿真，生成大量天线数据，比较不同机器学习模型性能。

Result: GPU显著提升计算性能，开源软件在精细分辨率下与商业软件结果相似。

Conclusion: GPU和开源软件为天线设计和机器学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

### [173] [Pass@k Training for Adaptively Balancing Exploration and Exploitation of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10751)
*Zhipeng Chen,Xiaobo Qin,Youbin Wu,Yue Ling,Qinghao Ye,Wayne Xin Zhao,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Pass@k奖励的强化学习方法（RLVR），通过分析Pass@k训练的优势，解决了探索与利用的平衡问题，并展示了其在提升模型探索能力方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法采用Pass@1作为奖励，导致策略倾向于保守行为，陷入局部最优。Pass@k作为奖励的潜力及其与探索能力的关系尚未被充分研究。

Method: 使用Pass@k作为奖励训练策略模型（Pass@k Training），并通过分析推导其优势函数，设计高效的训练过程。

Result: Pass@k Training显著提升了模型的探索能力，并揭示了探索与利用可以相互促进的关系。初步实验验证了优势函数设计的有效性。

Conclusion: Pass@k Training为RLVR提供了一种新的研究方向，优势函数设计展示了未来潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前三维生成模型在药物发现中受限于公开可用的蛋白质-配体复合物数据稀缺，导致模型过拟合训练集偏差。

Method: IBEX利用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论量化样本信息密度，结合Scaffold Hopping任务提升模型能力，并通过L-BFGS优化步骤精细调整构象。

Result: IBEX将零样本对接成功率从53%提升至64%，Vina评分从-7.41 kcal/mol优化至-8.07 kcal/mol，并在多项指标上达到最优。

Conclusion: IBEX通过改进信息利用和优化策略，显著提升了药物设计中的生成性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

TL;DR: DECAF-GAD是一个解决图异常检测（GAD）中公平性问题的框架，通过解耦敏感属性和表示学习，提升公平性同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN-based GAD模型可能放大训练数据中的偏见，导致不公平结果，而现有公平性研究多针对节点分类任务，而非广泛用于异常检测的自编码器结构。

Method: 提出DECAF-GAD框架，基于结构因果模型（SCM）解耦敏感属性，设计专用自编码器架构和公平性导向的损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DECAF-GAD在异常检测性能和公平性指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD有效解决了GAD中的公平性问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中（如医疗和推荐系统），传统的RMAB算法假设平稳性，但实际动态往往非平稳，导致算法失效。

Method: 提出RMAB算法，结合滑动窗口强化学习和UCB机制，学习动态变化。

Result: 算法实现了$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$的遗憾界。

Conclusion: RMAB为非平稳RMAB问题提供了首个理论框架，解决了传统算法的局限性。

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Result: 研究结果为在线GP算法选择合适标准提供了实用指南。

Conclusion: 本文为在线GP算法的数据点缩减和接受标准提供了统一比较和实用建议。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

Motivation: 数据最小化（DM）是GDPR等法规的核心原则，但在机器学习（ML）应用中常被忽视，导致实践混乱。

Method: 引入一个统一的DMML框架，包括数据流程、对手模型和最小化点，并系统梳理相关文献。

Result: 首次提供了一个结构化概述，帮助实践者和研究者有效应用DM原则。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了DM原则在AI/ML中的统一理解和广泛应用。

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Conclusion: 该协议为数据归属任务提供了一种高效且可信的验证方法，适用于广泛的线性函数验证任务。

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

Motivation: AI驱动的药物设计缺乏实验先验知识，导致生成的分子可能违反隐式约束（如致突变性）。

Method: 构建\ourdataset数据集，包含3200万对自然语言事实和实体表示（如SMILES或refseq ID），并训练LLM、CLIP和LLava架构联合推理文本和设计目标。

Result: 使用\ourdataset预训练的模型在TDC任务中表现优于更大的模型，并在GuacaMol中生成更安全的分子。

Conclusion: \ourdataset能有效提升AI药物设计的先验知识，生成更安全且有效的分子。

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

Motivation: 探索稳定匹配问题的参数化近似性，以解决NP-hard和W[1]-hard问题，为实际应用提供理论支持。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明了Min-BP-SMI和Min-BP-SRI在参数β下的W[1]-hard性，并提出了Max-SMTI的FPT-近似方案。

Result: Min-BP-SMI和Min-BP-SRI难以近似，而Max-SMTI在特定参数下存在FPT-近似方案。

Conclusion: 稳定匹配问题的参数化近似性研究揭示了其计算复杂性，并为特定问题提供了可行的近似算法。

Abstract: We study parameterized approximability of three optimization problems related
to stable matching: (1) Min-BP-SMI: Given a stable marriage instance and a
number k, find a size-at-least-k matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of
blocking pairs; (2) Min-BP-SRI: Given a stable roommates instance, find a
matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (3) Max-SMTI:
Given a stable marriage instance with preferences containing ties, find a
maximum-size stable matching.
  The first two problems are known to be NP-hard to approximate to any constant
factor and W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$, making the existence of an EPTAS
or FPT-algorithms unlikely. We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to
$\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\beta$. This means that unless
FPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\beta$. The
last problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33
and W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and
present an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter "number of agents with
ties".

Abstract: We consider the problem of routing for logistics purposes, in a contested
environment where an adversary attempts to disrupt the vehicle along the chosen
route. We construct a game-theoretic model that captures the problem of optimal
routing in such an environment. While basic robust deterministic routing plans
are already challenging to devise, they tend to be predictable, which can limit
their effectiveness. By introducing calculated randomness via modeling the
route planning process as a two-player zero-sum game, we compute immediately
deployable plans that are diversified and harder to anticipate. Although
solving the game exactly is intractable in theory, our use of the double-oracle
framework enables us to achieve computation times on the order of seconds,
making the approach operationally viable. In particular, the framework is
modular enough to accommodate specialized routing algorithms as oracles. We
evaluate our method on real-world scenarios, showing that it scales effectively
to realistic problem sizes and significantly benefits from explicitly modeling
the adversary's capabilities, as demonstrated through ablation studies and
comparisons with baseline approaches.

Abstract: Equilibria of realistic multiplayer games constitute a key solution concept
both in practical applications, such as online advertising auctions and
electricity markets, and in analytical frameworks used to study strategic
voting in elections or assess policy impacts in integrated assessment models.
However, efficiently computing these equilibria requires games to have a
carefully designed structure and satisfy numerous restrictions; otherwise, the
computational complexity becomes prohibitive. In particular, finding even
approximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more
players is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for
computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from
poor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or
lack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose
a formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial
complementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial
branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative
analysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show
the relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of
computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods.

Abstract: Global localization is essential for autonomous robotics, especially in
indoor environments where the GPS signal is denied. We propose a novel
WiFi-based localization framework that leverages ubiquitous wireless
infrastructure and the OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for large-scale indoor
environments. Our approach integrates signal propagation modeling with osmAG's
geometric and topological priors. In the offline phase, an iterative
optimization algorithm localizes WiFi Access Points (APs) by modeling wall
attenuation, achieving a mean localization error of 3.79 m (35.3\% improvement
over trilateration). In the online phase, real-time robot localization uses the
augmented osmAG map, yielding a mean error of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas
(8.77\% improvement over KNN fingerprinting) and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted
areas (81.05\% improvement). Comparison with a fingerprint-based method shows
that our approach is much more space efficient and achieves superior
localization accuracy, especially for positions where no fingerprint data are
available. Validated across a complex 11,025 &m^2& multi-floor environment,
this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor robotic
localization, solving the kidnapped robot problem. The code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/XuMa369/osmag-wifi-localization.

Motivation: 解决在动态环境中生成无碰撞轨迹时，初始猜测难以获取的问题。

Method: 利用空间-时间凸集图（ST-GCS）生成最优轨迹，无需初始猜测，并探索了通用约束的适配策略。

Result: ST-GCS在静态环境中与标准GCS效果相同，在动态环境中能生成最优无碰撞轨迹。

Conclusion: ST-GCS是一种高效的方法，适用于动态环境中的轨迹规划。

Abstract: In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories
through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal
constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult.
Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of
Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance
collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver.
We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and
document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the
framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard
GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating
in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.

Result: 在Atalante外骨骼上验证，展示了更强的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: HDDPC框架为外骨骼提供了高效、统一的运动规划解决方案。

Abstract: Robust bipedal locomotion in exoskeletons requires the ability to dynamically
react to changes in the environment in real time. This paper introduces the
hybrid data-driven predictive control (HDDPC) framework, an extension of the
data-enabled predictive control, that addresses these challenges by
simultaneously planning foot contact schedules and continuous domain
trajectories. The proposed framework utilizes a Hankel matrix-based
representation to model system dynamics, incorporating step-to-step (S2S)
transitions to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments. By integrating
contact scheduling with trajectory planning, the framework offers an efficient,
unified solution for locomotion motion synthesis that enables robust and
reactive walking through online replanning. We validate the approach on the
Atalante exoskeleton, demonstrating improved robustness and adaptability.

Result: 实验证明ReconVLA在模拟和真实场景中均表现优异，实现了精确操作和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReconVLA通过隐式接地方法有效解决了视觉注意力分配问题，提升了任务表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

Conclusion: BEASST通过智能不确定性驱动导航，在复杂环境中实现了高效稳定的源搜索。

Abstract: This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive
Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking
in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to
efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal
strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral
Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an
objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking
based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides
theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and
practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across
DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length
and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven
navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious
exploration.

Conclusion: FAVOR方法显著提升了少样本识别能力，并增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large reasoning models enables learning from
feedback on their outputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where
fine-tuning data is limited. However, its application in multi-modal human
activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work
extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with
multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement
learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on
few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual
reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable
explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human
activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR.
Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image,
each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then
evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized
using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the
MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few
samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and
five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该框架提升了外骨骼的语义理解和协作能力，为家庭护理场景提供了更安全的辅助支持。

Abstract: Upper-limb exoskeletons are primarily designed to provide assistive support
by accurately interpreting and responding to human intentions. In home-care
scenarios, exoskeletons are expected to adapt their assistive configurations
based on the semantic information of the task, adjusting appropriately in
accordance with the nature of the object being manipulated. However, existing
solutions often lack the ability to understand task semantics or
collaboratively plan actions with the user, limiting their generalizability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces a semantic-aware framework that
integrates large language models into the task planning framework, enabling the
delivery of safe and intent-integrative assistance. The proposed approach
begins with the exoskeleton operating in transparent mode to capture the
wearer's intent during object grasping. Once semantic information is extracted
from the task description, the system automatically configures appropriate
assistive parameters. In addition, a diffusion-based anomaly detector is used
to continuously monitor the state of human-robot interaction and trigger
real-time replanning in response to detected anomalies. During task execution,
online trajectory refinement and impedance control are used to ensure safety
and regulate human-robot interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method effectively aligns with the wearer's cognition, adapts to
semantically varying tasks, and responds reliably to anomalies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉被视为被动光学感知，而主动光学感知（如LiDAR）在机器人感知任务中潜力巨大，但低成本LiDAR数据稀疏限制了其应用。

Method: 利用非重复扫描LiDAR（NRS-LiDAR）特性，提出反射校准和动态场景转换方法，构建密集反射图像生成框架。

Result: 开发了LiDAR反射图像密集化数据集和专用网络，应用于闭环检测和交通车道识别等任务。

Conclusion: 该工作重新定义了主动视觉的边界，为低成本LiDAR的广泛应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive
optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as
measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation
now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active
optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of
active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance
from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination
conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such
as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities,
typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge
with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their
broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an
innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse
data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR
(NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration
and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the
reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key
contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR
reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for
NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane
detection using the generated dense reflectance images.

Abstract: Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable
of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world
environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence
(AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied
agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open

embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In
this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered
embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We
investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms,
detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution,
and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For
embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating
on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning
in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of
embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing
decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved,
challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey,
potentially as the further research directions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

Result: 在R2R-CE和RxR-CE基准测试中，CorrectNav模型分别达到65.1%和69.3%的成功率，优于之前最佳模型。

Conclusion: Self-correction Flywheel范式显著提升了模型的错误校正能力和导航性能，适用于动态障碍物避障和长指令跟随。

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

Motivation: 重型WMR在严格国际标准和易受干扰的环境下，黑盒DNN方法的部署存在挑战，需要一种兼顾高精度和鲁棒性的控制策略。

Method: 设计了一个分层控制策略，包括DNN作为主控制策略和两个安全层（低层RAC和高层监控），以应对不同级别的干扰。

Result: 实验验证了该策略在6000 kg WMR上的有效性，实现了系统稳定性和安全性。

Conclusion: DNN与RAC的结合为重型WMR提供了一种高效且安全的控制方案，满足了实际应用需求。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low
computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However,
the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty
wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international
standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical
control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with
differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and
deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance
under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach
a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined
threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary
control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)
policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring
stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system
robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a
high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during
operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently
severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would
jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC
policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while
adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg
WMR.

Abstract: Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a
larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,
maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,
many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in
some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic
research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in
the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by
researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart
system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot
interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that
reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is
solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a
modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers
and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of
the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa
Motoman GP4.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂机器人冗余管理提供了通用且用户友好的解决方案，减少了专家设计的依赖。

Abstract: Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial
robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform
multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving
reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks
(SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified
framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting
their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework
that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from
user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic
Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies
without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as
precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate
our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a
dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned
SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs,
balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This
approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy
management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and
reducing the need for expert design.

Result: KDPE在模拟单臂任务和真实机器人实验中表现优于Diffusion Policy。

Conclusion: KDPE通过核密度估计有效提升了策略的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has
been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches
tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with
generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on
a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.
While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that
may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,
the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of
generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,
it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work
focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either
with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.
Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that
filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while
keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,
we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for
actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper
state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on
simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

Result: 理论证明和实验表明，CVIRO在定位精度和一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CVIRO通过联合估计和可观测性保持，显著提升了UWB辅助VIO系统的性能。

Abstract: Ultra Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation
accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade
localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two
main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system
observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to
improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system
based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the
system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and
enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.
Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant
error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO
algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,
thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and
experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and
consistency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a
challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address
this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both
real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped
quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks
autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing
multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a
trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This
approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected
trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment
scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of
policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a
Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future
trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and
curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in
simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in
simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while
real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate
the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.

### [203] [Why Report Failed Interactions With Robots?! Towards Vignette-based Interaction Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10603)
*Agnes Axelsson,Merle Reimann,Ronald Cumbal,Hannah Pelikan,Divesh Lala*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出使用民族志小故事（vignettes）来揭示人机交互（HRI）中的失败案例，弥补现有研究的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs提升了人机交互质量，但与人人交互相比仍存在不足，且失败案例因情境而异，难以泛化。

Method: 提出并描述了一种基于个人经验的民族志小故事撰写方法，用于记录多学科视角下的失败案例。

Result: 民族志小故事能有效揭示罕见失败、促进机器人能力透明化，并记录研究中遗漏的意外行为。

Conclusion: 建议将民族志小故事作为现有交互评估方法的补充工具。

Abstract: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent
of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal
when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of
failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be
generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been
implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique
overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight
these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the
methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on
our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the
strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a
multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of
robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted
from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing
interaction evaluation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仿真平台缺乏对磁性材料的专门支持，导致不同专业水平的研究人员难以使用。

Method: 利用SOFA框架开发了一个仿真界面，支持定义材料属性、施加磁场并实时观察变形，同时集成了直观控制和应力分析功能。

Result: 通过四个基准模型（梁、三指和四指夹持器、蝴蝶）验证了工具的功能性，且软件易用性高。

Conclusion: 未来将通过实验验证和与行业标准有限元求解器的对比，进一步提升仿真精度。

Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized
simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic
fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic
materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise
levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface
using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed
to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material
properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real
time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it
aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four
benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -
demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible
to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine
accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard
finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of
magnetic soft robots.

Method: 使用神经网络生成的显著性地图识别关键区域，并将其融入现有探索策略中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著影响机器人的探索行为，提高效率。

Conclusion: 通过识别显著性区域，可以优化自主探索策略，提升探索效果。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a widely studied problem where a robot
incrementally builds a map of a previously unknown environment. The robot
selects the next locations to reach using an exploration strategy. To do so,
the robot has to balance between competing objectives, like exploring the
entirety of the environment, while being as fast as possible. Most exploration
strategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,
they do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than
others, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a
method that identifies \emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high
interest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network
that, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate
whether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not. We use
saliency areas to bias some widely used exploration strategies, showing, with
an extensive experimental campaign, that this knowledge can significantly
influence the behavior of the robot during exploration.

Result: 框架提供了一种透明且标准化的方法，用于识别、建模和传达感知风险。

Conclusion: SET框架旨在提升自主系统的安全保证，增强公众对其的理解和信任。

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交机器人在多种社交场景中的应用需求增加，模拟人类与机器人互动中的主观自我披露行为变得尤为重要。目前缺乏相关计算模型的研究。

Method: 开发了一种基于情感识别文献的多模态注意力网络，使用自收集的视频语料库进行训练，并设计了新的损失函数——尺度保持交叉熵损失。

Result: 最佳模型在F1分数上达到0.83，比基线模型提升了0.48。

Conclusion: 该研究为社交机器人识别互动伙伴的自我披露行为提供了重要进展，对社交机器人的社会认知能力至关重要。

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架（A2C算法），用于优化低地球轨道卫星的轨道参数，以实现精确的地面覆盖，并在计算效率和收敛速度上优于PPO算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道日益拥挤，卫星部署和运行面临碰撞风险增加的问题，需要智能化的轨道规划方法。

Method: 使用A2C算法在自定义的OpenAI Gymnasium环境中模拟轨道动力学，通过调整五个轨道参数实现目标覆盖。

Result: A2C算法在累积奖励和收敛速度上显著优于PPO（5.8倍奖励，31.5倍更快收敛），并能满足多样化任务需求。

Conclusion: 强化学习为低地球轨道任务规划提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，验证了A2C在连续轨道控制中的优越性。

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

Motivation: 由于ESN的参数选择和架构调整对性能影响复杂，且缺乏经验可能导致优化困难，因此需要理解这些因素的作用。

Method: 通过四种不同领域的基准任务（时间序列预测、模式生成、混沌系统预测和时间序列分类）进行实验，分析ESN的性能变化。

Result: 实验展示了ESN在不同架构、设计和参数选择下的性能表现，为初学者提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 本文为ESN的配置和参数选择提供了实用规则，填补了初学者在经验上的不足。

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REALISM的监管框架，用于协调多运营商共享微出行服务，通过公平评分机制优化车辆调度，提升城市目标达成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享微出行（如共享单车和电动滑板车）的快速发展带来了道路拥堵和车辆部署不公等社会问题，现有监管框架假设对运营商进行侵入式控制，实际不可行。

Method: 设计了REALISM框架，通过Shapley值评估运营商对城市目标的贡献，并优化公平评分模型，采用交替优化方法实现运营商与监管机构的互动。

Result: 基于芝加哥电动滑板车数据的实验表明，该方法在车辆使用公平性上提升至少39.93%，城市平均需求满足率提升1.82%。

Conclusion: REALISM框架有效解决了多运营商共享微出行服务的协调问题，提升了公平性和需求满足率。

Abstract: Shared micromobility (e.g., shared bikes and electric scooters), as a kind of
emerging urban transportation, has become more and more popular in the world.
However, the blooming of shared micromobility vehicles brings some social
problems to the city (e.g., overloaded vehicles on roads, and the inequity of
vehicle deployment), which deviate from the city regulator's expectation of the
service of the shared micromobility system. In addition, the multi-operator
shared micromobility system in a city complicates the problem because of their
non-cooperative self-interested pursuits. Existing regulatory frameworks of
multi-operator vehicle rebalancing generally assume the intrusive control of
vehicle rebalancing of all the operators, which is not practical in the real
world. To address this limitation, we design REALISM, a regulatory framework
for coordinated scheduling in multi-operator shared micromobility services that
incorporates the city regulator's regulations in the form of assigning a score
to each operator according to the city goal achievements and operators'
individual contributions to achieving the city goal, measured by Shapley value.
To realize the fairness-aware score assignment, we measure the fairness of
assigned scores and use them as one of the components to optimize the score
assignment model. To optimize the whole framework, we develop an alternating
procedure to make operators and the city regulator interact with each other
until convergence. We evaluate our framework based on real-world e-scooter
usage data in Chicago. Our experiment results show that our method achieves a
performance gain of at least 39.93% in the equity of vehicle usage and 1.82% in
the average demand satisfaction of the whole city.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR模型广泛应用，但易受对抗攻击影响，研究旨在验证攻击鲁棒性并提高其隐蔽性。

Method: 通过放松优化目标（从完全抑制到部分抑制）来降低攻击的感知性，并探索防御方法。

Result: 部分抑制攻击可提高隐蔽性，低通滤波器可能成为有效防御手段。

Conclusion: 攻击隐蔽性可通过优化目标调整提升，低通滤波器是潜在防御方案。

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an
extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the
possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially
suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of
these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility.
We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete
suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the
imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these
attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an
effective defence.

Motivation: 1/f波动广泛存在于多种系统中，但缺乏统一的解释机制。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过扩展Kuramoto模型模拟随机同步，以及频率选择性共振，结合AM/DM机制生成1/f谱。

Result: 数值模拟表明，AM/DM机制能稳定产生1/f谱，且Kuramoto临界点非必需。该机制在音乐、地震和天体物理数据中均适用。

Conclusion: 解调是1/f波动的通用路径，为自然和工程系统中的普遍性提供了简单解释。

Abstract: We propose a universal physical mechanism for the emergence of 1/f
fluctuations, observed across a wide range of systems. In particular, we verify
this on acoustic cases. The mechanism is based on amplitude modulation (AM) and
demodulation (DM), where the 1/f spectral law arises not in the raw waveform
but in its demodulated amplitude envelope. Two distinct yet complementary
processes generate the required AM: (i) stochastic synchronization among
oscillators, modeled via an extended Kuramoto framework that captures perpetual
synchronization-desynchronization cycles, and (ii) frequency-selective
resonance, modeled by spectral accumulation of eigenmodes in acoustic or
structural environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both
mechanisms, acting separately or in combination, robustly produce 1/f spectra
over several decades when DM is applied, and that the classical Kuramoto
critical point is not necessary for their emergence. We demonstrate the
cross-domain relevance of this AM/DM framework through analyses of musical
performances, seismic records, and astrophysical time series, revealing a
common underlying structure. This work establishes demodulation as a general
route to 1/f fluctuations, providing a simple and scalable explanation for its
ubiquity in both natural and engineered systems.

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of animal sounds, offers a non-invasive method to
monitor ecosystems. Extracting embeddings from audio-pretrained deep learning
(DL) models without fine-tuning has become popular for obtaining bioacoustic
features for tasks. However, a recent benchmark study reveals that while
fine-tuned audio-pretrained VGG and transformer models achieve state-of-the-art
performance in some tasks, they fail in others. This study benchmarks 11 DL
models on the same tasks by reducing their learned embeddings' dimensionality
and evaluating them through clustering. We found that audio-pretrained DL
models 1) without fine-tuning even underperform fine-tuned AlexNet, 2) both
with and without fine-tuning fail to separate the background from labeled
sounds, but ResNet does, and 3) outperform other models when fewer background
sounds are included during fine-tuning. This study underscores the necessity of
fine-tuning audio-pretrained models and checking the embeddings after
fine-tuning. Our codes are available:

Conclusion: AHEAD-DS和YAMNet+为听力设备场景识别提供了标准化数据和高效模型，支持边缘部署。

Abstract: Scene recognition of audiologically relevant environments is important for
hearing aids; however, it is challenging, in part because of the limitations of
existing datasets. Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or
audiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine
learning models. Deploying these models on resource-constrained edge devices
presents another challenge. Our solution is two-fold: we leverage several open
source datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for scene recognition of
audiologically relevant environments, and introduce YAMNet+, a sound
recognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available
dataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model
comparison. YAMNet+ is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones
connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with
hearing aid functionality; serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene
recognition. YAMNet+ achieved a mean average precision of 0.83 and accuracy of
0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories of
audiologically relevant environments. We found that applying transfer learning
from the pretrained YAMNet model was essential. We demonstrated real-time
sound-based scene recognition capabilities on edge devices by deploying YAMNet+
to an Android smartphone. Even with a Google Pixel 3 (a phone with modest
specifications, released in 2018), the model processes audio with approximately
50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms
per 1 second of audio. Our website and code

Motivation: 构音障碍者因运动控制受损导致语音清晰度下降，传统数据集难以满足个性化TTS模型训练需求。

Method: 采用领域迁移任务框架，结合教师-学生模型和课程学习，通过音频增强优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，模型生成的合成语音显著减少构音错误，保持高说话人保真度和韵律自然性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构音障碍者的个性化语音合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dysarthric speakers experience substantial communication challenges due to
impaired motor control of the speech apparatus, which leads to reduced speech
intelligibility. This creates significant obstacles in dataset curation since
actual recording of long, articulate sentences for the objective of training
personalized TTS models becomes infeasible. Thus, the limited availability of
audio data, in addition to the articulation errors that are present within the
audio, complicates personalized speech synthesis for target dysarthric speaker
adaptation. To address this, we frame the issue as a domain transfer task and
introduce a knowledge anchoring framework that leverages a teacher-student
model, enhanced by curriculum learning through audio augmentation. Experimental
results show that the proposed zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model effectively
generates synthetic speech with markedly reduced articulation errors and high
speaker fidelity, while maintaining prosodic naturalness.

Result: 交替使用两种模型显著提升了PESQ、STOI和CBAK评分，并通过图形分析展示了其优势。

Conclusion: PuttNet作为后处理模型有效减少了语音增强的伪影，交替使用策略优于单独重复使用任一模型。

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from
noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech
enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred
to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a
post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by
speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an
`Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating
between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to
improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ),
objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK)
scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating
Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

automatic motive segmentation in Korean folk songs by fine-tuning a speech
transcription model on audio lyric with motif boundary annotation. Applying
this to 856 songs, we extracted motif count and duration entropy as structural
features. Statistical analysis revealed that these features vary systematically
according to the social function of the songs. Songs associated with collective
labor, for instance, showed different structural patterns from those for
entertainment or personal settings. This work offers a scalable approach for
quantitative structural analysis of oral music traditions.

Conclusion: FSW数据集和数据增强策略显著提升了真实场景下的深度伪造语音检测性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the
widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms.
While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public
datasets, their performance degrades significantly in cross-domain scenarios.
To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake
Speech Wild (FSW) dataset, which includes 254 hours of real and deepfake audio
from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we
establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised
learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We
also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM
robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by
augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we
significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance,
achieving an average equal error rate (EER) of 3.54% across all evaluation
sets.

Abstract: The field of speech separation, addressing the "cocktail party problem", has
seen revolutionary advances with DNNs. Speech separation enhances clarity in
complex acoustic environments and serves as crucial pre-processing for speech
recognition and speaker recognition. However, current literature focuses
narrowly on specific architectures or isolated approaches, creating fragmented
understanding. This survey addresses this gap by providing systematic
examination of DNN-based speech separation techniques. Our work differentiates
itself through: (I) Comprehensive perspective: We systematically investigate
learning paradigms, separation scenarios with known/unknown speakers,
comparative analysis of supervised/self-supervised/unsupervised frameworks, and
architectural components from encoders to estimation strategies. (II)
Timeliness: Coverage of cutting-edge developments ensures access to current
innovations and benchmarks. (III) Unique insights: Beyond summarization, we
evaluate technological trajectories, identify emerging patterns, and highlight
promising directions including domain-robust frameworks, efficient
architectures, multimodal integration, and novel self-supervised paradigms.
(IV) Fair evaluation: We provide quantitative evaluations on standard datasets,
revealing true capabilities and limitations of different methods. This
comprehensive survey serves as an accessible reference for experienced
researchers and newcomers navigating speech separation's complex landscape.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何将多模态大语言模型（mLLMs）应用于边界表示（B-rep）CAD对象的高级编辑任务，提出了一种名为B-repLer的微调模型，解决了3D数据缺乏和表示复杂性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管mLLMs在图像和文本任务中表现出色，但在3D分析和编辑任务中表现有限，尤其是B-rep CAD对象的编辑，缺乏标注数据和表示复杂性是主要挑战。

Method: 提出B-repLer，一种专为B-rep设计的微调mLLM，结合新型多模态架构和现有CAD工具，自动生成所需推理数据集。

Result: B-repLer能够理解文本提示并对B-rep进行语义编辑，生成有效输出，实现了多种复杂度的文本驱动编辑任务。

Conclusion: B-repLer展示了mLLMs在3D CAD编辑中的潜力，为无需外部标注的自动化编辑提供了新方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as
a universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many
specialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across
many applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes
them suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards
specialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and
editing tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as
well as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate
whether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary
Representation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for
precisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the
representation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no
publicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD
construction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can
understand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce
valid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically
designed to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in
conjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required
reasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively
evaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various
complexity, which were not previously possible.

recordings spanning over 24 days. Adhering to long time-scale symptom
fluctuations, we highlight the extended context window of 30 minutes. We
present an optimized pre-training loss function for neural electrophysiological
data that corrects for the frequency bias of common masked auto-encoder loss
functions due to the 1-over-f power law. We show in a downstream task the
decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms with leave-one-subject-out

TL;DR: VR空间推理课程与传统方法效果相当，但更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEM中空间推理能力对少数群体尤为重要，但现有课程未普及。VR可能提供高效教学工具。

Method: 将传统课程模块改编为VR课程，结合教育支架和实时反馈，进行三周实验，对比VR与非VR课程效果。

Result: VR课程显著提升空间能力，效果与传统课程相当，但时间更短。学生反馈积极，晕动症较少。

Conclusion: VR是高效的空间推理教学工具，适合推广。

Abstract: Background: Spatial reasoning has been identified as a critical skill for
success in STEM. Unfortunately, under-represented groups often have lower
incoming spatial ability. Courses that improve spatial skills exist but are not
widely used. Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested as a possible tool for
teaching spatial reasoning since students are more accurate and complete
spatial tasks more quickly in three dimensions. However, no prior work has
developed or evaluated a fully-structured VR spatial skills course. Objectives:
We seek to assess the effectiveness of teaching spatial reasoning in VR, both
in isolation as a structured training curriculum and also in comparison to
traditional methods. Methods: We adapted three modules of an existing
pencil-and-paper course to VR, leveraging educational scaffolding and real-time
feedback in the design. We evaluated our three-week course in a study with
$n=24$ undergraduate introductory STEM students, capturing both quantitative
spatial ability gains (using pre- and post test scores on validated
assessments) and qualitative insights (from a post-study questionnaire). We
also compared our VR course to an offering of a baseline non-VR course (using
data collected in a previous study). Results and Conclusions: Students who took
our VR course had significant spatial ability gains. Critically, we find no
significant difference in outcomes between our VR course (3 meetings of 120
minutes each) and a baseline pencil and paper course (10 meetings of 90 minutes
each), suggesting that spatial reasoning can be very efficiently taught in VR.
We observed cybersickness at lower rates than are generally reported and most
students reported enjoying learning in VR.

Conclusion: ParseJargon为跨学科交流提供实用工具，具广泛教育应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective interdisciplinary communication is frequently hindered by
domain-specific jargon. To explore the jargon barriers in-depth, we conducted a
formative diary study with 16 professionals, revealing critical limitations in
current jargon-management strategies during workplace meetings. Based on these
insights, we designed ParseJargon, an interactive LLM-powered system providing
real-time personalized jargon identification and explanations tailored to
users' individual backgrounds. A controlled experiment comparing ParseJargon
against baseline (no support) and general-purpose (non-personalized) conditions
demonstrated that personalized jargon support significantly enhanced
participants' comprehension, engagement, and appreciation of colleagues' work,
whereas general-purpose support negatively affected engagement. A follow-up
field study validated ParseJargon's usability and practical value in real-time
meetings, highlighting both opportunities and limitations for real-world
deployment. Our findings contribute insights into designing personalized jargon
support tools, with implications for broader interdisciplinary and educational
applications.

Motivation: 探讨AI是否需发展内部情感状态（AE）以实现更全面的情感智能（AEI），推动通用人工智能（AGI）发展。

Method: 综述了AE在机器学习中的表现，分析了情感调制的架构，总结了AE建模与整合机制。

Result: 提出了AE对AI的潜在优势，并指出当前缺乏清晰的情感实现框架。

Conclusion: AE可能对AI未来发展有益，但需关注伦理与安全风险。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has enabled Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to
recognise, interpret, and respond to human emotions - a capability also known
as Artificial Emotional Intelligence (AEI). It is increasingly seen as an
important component of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We discuss
whether in order to peruse this goal, AI benefits from moving beyond emotion
recognition and synthesis to develop internal emotion-like states, which we
term as Artificial Emotion (AE). This shift potentially allows AI to benefit
from the paradigm of `inner emotions' in ways we - as humans - do. Although
recent research shows early signs that AI systems may exhibit AE-like
behaviours, a clear framework for how emotions can be realised in AI remains
underexplored. In this paper, we discuss potential advantages of AE in AI,
review current manifestations of AE in machine learning systems, examine
emotion-modulated architectures, and summarise mechanisms for modelling and
integrating AE into future AI. We also explore the ethical implications and
safety risks associated with `emotional' AGI, while concluding with our opinion
on how AE could be beneficial in the future.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成式AI（GenAI）在教育中的应用如何重塑学生学习方式，强调了自我调节学习（SRL）的重要性，并提出了一种分层系统模型来分析SRL行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GenAI在教育中的普及，理解学生如何在这种新环境中进行自我调节学习变得至关重要。现有方法对SRL的线性假设忽略了其动态和非线性特性，因此需要更准确的分析方法。

Method: 研究采用隐马尔可夫模型（HMMs）分析高等教育学生在GenAI辅助学术写作中的数字痕迹数据，将SRL建模为分层系统（从观察到隐藏的战术和策略）。

Result: 研究发现三类不同的学习者群体，各自采用不同的SRL策略，且这些策略与任务表现显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究为SRL建模提供了新方法，并为设计适应性学习技术以支持GenAI增强的教育环境提供了依据。

Abstract: The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into education is reshaping how
students learn, making self-regulated learning (SRL) - the ability to plan,
monitor, and adapt one's learning - more important than ever. To support
learners in these new contexts, it is essential to understand how SRL unfolds
during interaction with GenAI tools. Learning analytics offers powerful
techniques for analyzing digital trace data to infer SRL behaviors. However,
existing approaches often assume SRL processes are linear, segmented, and
non-overlapping-assumptions that overlook the dynamic, recursive, and
non-linear nature of real-world learning. We address this by conceptualizing
SRL as a layered system: observable learning patterns reflect hidden tactics
(short, purposeful action states), which combine into broader SRL strategies.
Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), we analyzed trace data from higher education
students engaged in GenAI-assisted academic writing. We identified three
distinct groups of learners, each characterized by different SRL strategies.
These groups showed significant differences in performance, indicating that
students' use of different SRL strategies in GenAI-assisted writing led to
varying task outcomes. Our findings advance the methodological toolkit for
modeling SRL and inform the design of adaptive learning technologies that more
effectively support learners in GenAI-enhanced educational environments.

Motivation: 静态草图难以准确表达相对运动，需理解设计师在运动探索中的认知现象以改进设计工具。

Method: 32名参与者完成控制任务和两个焦点任务（运动探索和概念生成），EEG数据用Python处理并分析。

Result: inter-BRPD以更少参数捕捉心理努力，统计验证其可靠性和有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为概念设计支持工具的开发提供了新视角。

Abstract: Conceptual design is a cognitively complex task, especially in the
engineering design of products having relative motion between components.
Designers prefer sketching as a medium for conceptual design and use gestures
and annotations to represent such relative motion. Literature suggests that
static representations of motion in sketches may not achieve the intended
functionality when realised, because it primarily depends on the designers'
mental capabilities for motion simulation. Thus, it is important to understand
the cognitive phenomena when designers are exploring concepts of articulated
products. The current work is an attempt to understand design neurocognition by
categorising the tasks and measuring the mental effort involved in these tasks
using EEG. The analysis is intended to validate design intervention tools to
support the conceptual design involving motion exploration. A novel EEG-based
metric, inter-Band Relative Power Difference (inter-BRPD), is introduced to
quantify mental effort. A design experiment is conducted with 32 participants,
where they have to perform one control task and 2 focus tasks corresponding to
the motion exploration task (MET) and the concept generation task (CGT),
respectively. EEG data is recorded during the 3 tasks, cleaned, processed and
analysed using the MNE library in Python. It is observed from the results that
inter-BRPD captures the essence of mental effort with half the number of
conventionally used parameters. The reliability and efficacy of the inter-BRPD
metric are also statistically validated against literature-based cognitive
metrics. With these new insights, the study opens up possibilities for creating
support for conceptual design and its evaluation.

Abstract: More and more people, especially females, create and view beauty videos
covering topics like makeup tutorials and vlogs on social media platforms.
Understanding the communication strategies that creators use in these videos
and how they affect viewers' engagement can help spread beauty knowledge. By
coding 352 beauty videos in Rednote, this study presents a comprehensive
taxonomy of communication strategies used by the creators, such as using home
as the video background and displaying makeup effects when starting the
narrative at the beginning. We further label and computationally classify six
categories of comments that reveal viewers' engagement with beauty videos. The
regression analyses reveal the effects of beauty video communication strategies
on viewers' engagement; for example, calling viewers to take action at the end
tends to attract more comments that debate the product's efficacy. We discuss
insights into fostering the creation of beauty videos and the communication of
beauty knowledge.

Result: 通过14个QA案例验证了MCP2OSC在OSC消息处理中的有效性，展示了其潜力。

Conclusion: MCP2OSC为多媒体设备提供了一种基于LLM的通用控制机制新思路。

Abstract: Text prompts enable intuitive content creation but may fall short in
achieving high precision for intricate tasks; knob or slider controls offer
precise adjustments at the cost of increased complexity. To address the gap
between knobs and prompts, a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and a
unique set of prompt design criteria are presented to enable exploring
parametric OSC (OpenSoundControl) control by natural language prompts.
Demonstrated by 14 practical QA examples with best practices and the
generalized prompt templates, this study finds Claude integrated with the
MCP2OSC server effective in generating OSC messages by natural language,
interpreting, searching, and visualizing OSC messages, validating and debugging
OSC messages, and managing OSC address patterns. MCP2OSC enhances human-machine
collaboration by leveraging LLM (Large Language Model) to handle intricate OSC
development tasks, and by empowering human creativity with an intuitive
language interface featuring flexible precision controls: a prompt-based OSC
tool. This study provides a novel perspective on the creative MCP application
at the network protocol level by utilizing LLM's strength in directly
processing and generating human-readable OSC messages. The results suggest its
potential for a LLM-based universal control mechanism for multimedia devices.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a multi-modal, interdisciplinary field
focused on designing, studying, and improving the interactions between people
and computer systems. This involves the design of systems that can recognize,
interpret, and respond to human emotions or stress. Developing systems to
monitor and react to stressful events can help prevent severe health
implications caused by long-term stress exposure. Currently, the publicly
available datasets and standardized protocols for data collection in this
domain are limited. Therefore, we introduce a multi-modal dataset intended for
wearable affective computing research, specifically the development of
automated stress recognition systems. We systematically review the publicly
available datasets recorded in controlled laboratory settings. Based on a
proposed framework for the standardization of stress experiments and data
collection, we collect physiological and motion signals from wearable devices
(e.g., electrodermal activity, photoplethysmography, three-axis accelerometer).
During the experimental protocol, we differentiate between the following four
affective/activity states: neutral, physical, cognitive stress, and
socio-evaluative stress. These different phases are meticulously labeled,
allowing for detailed analysis and reconstruction of each experiment. Meta-data
such as body positions, locations, and rest phases are included as further
annotations. In addition, we collect psychological self-assessments after each
stressor to evaluate subjects' affective states. The contributions of this
paper are twofold: 1) a novel multi-modal, publicly available dataset for
automated stress recognition, and 2) a benchmark for stress detection with 89\%
in a binary classification (baseline vs. stress) and 82\% in a multi-class
classification (baseline vs. stress vs. physical exercise).

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective
emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary
study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological
features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with
continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated
Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and
electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking
videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random
Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically
controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all
candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited
reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving
a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous
reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect
often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising
for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and
reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot
interaction systems.

Conclusion: 不同生理指标反映不同空间行为特征，为虚拟社交行为的多模态评估提供依据。

Abstract: Proxemics, the study of spatial behavior, is fundamental to social
interaction and increasingly relevant for virtual reality (VR) applications.
While previous research has established that users respond to personal space
violations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific
physiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain
understudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to
personal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening
facial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence
these responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design
manipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression
(neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart
rate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were
individually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR
responses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the
approach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged
proximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing
than the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV,
reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort
ratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that
different physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic
responses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV
responds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing
comprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化车辆虽提升安全与舒适，但也带来驾驶员分心、情境意识下降等新风险，需动态管理。

Method: 提出DEV框架，基于驾驶员、环境和车辆的动态交互，实时评估风险并调整自动化水平。

Result: 框架支持平滑过渡和有效协作，引入核心指标（驾驶员参与度、环境复杂性、车辆参与度）量化风险。

Conclusion: DEV框架为多学科研究提供统一视角，推动动态、风险感知的驾驶自动化系统发展。

Abstract: The increasing integration of automation in vehicles aims to enhance both
safety and comfort, but it also introduces new risks, including driver
disengagement, reduced situation awareness, and mode confusion. In this work,
we propose the DEV framework, a closed-loop framework for risk-aware adaptive
driving automation that captures the dynamic interplay between the driver, the
environment, and the vehicle. The framework promotes to continuously adjusting
the operational level of automation based on a risk management strategy. The
real-time risk assessment supports smoother transitions and effective
cooperation between the driver and the automation system. Furthermore, we
introduce a nomenclature of indexes corresponding to each core component,
namely driver involvement, environment complexity, and vehicle engagement, and
discuss how their interaction influences driving risk. The DEV framework offers
a comprehensive perspective to align multidisciplinary research efforts and
guide the development of dynamic, risk-aware driving automation systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了皮肤电活动（EDA）如何反映驾驶员在不同交通条件和自适应巡航控制（ACC）使用下的认知分心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解EDA指标是否及如何反映驾驶员的认知分心，以及交通条件和ACC使用对其的影响。

Method: 参与者驾驶模拟器，在不同认知分心（有无心算任务）和交通条件（三种复杂度）下自由使用ACC，分析三种EDA指标（SCL、SCR振幅、SCR频率）。

Result: 所有EDA指标均受认知分心和ACC使用显著影响，交通条件影响SCL和SCR振幅，但不影响SCR频率。

Conclusion: EDA指标能反映驾驶员因认知分心、驾驶环境和自动化使用导致的心理负荷变化。

Abstract: In this simulator study, we investigate whether and how electrodermal
activity (EDA) reflects driver cognitive distraction under varying traffic
conditions and adaptive cruise control (ACC) use. Participants drove in six
scenarios, combining two levels of cognitive distraction (presence/absence of a
mental calculation task) and three levels of driving environment complexity
(different traffic conditions). Throughout the experiment, they were free to
activate or deactivate ACC (ACC use, two levels). We analyzed three EDA-based
indicators of cognitive distraction: SCL (mean skin conductance level), SCR
amplitude (mean amplitude of skin conductance responses), and SCR rate (rate of
skin conductance responses). Results indicate that all three indicators were
significantly influenced by cognitive distraction and ACC use, while
environment complexity influenced SCL and SCR amplitude, but not SCR rate.
These findings suggest that EDA-based indicators reflect variations in drivers'
mental workload due not only to cognitive distraction, but also to driving
environment and automation use.

TL;DR: 研究通过模拟驾驶实验，探讨了不同交通条件和自适应巡航控制（ACC）使用下，驾驶员认知分心对注视参数的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解认知分心如何通过注视参数反映，并分析交通复杂性和ACC使用对注视行为的影响。

Method: 参与者完成六种驾驶场景，结合认知分心（有无心算）和交通复杂性，自由使用ACC，分析注视中心百分比和注视分散度。

Result: 交通复杂性增加垂直注视分散度，ACC使用使注视集中到道路中心；认知分心减少道路中心注视，增加垂直分散度。心算期间注视集中度短暂增加。

Conclusion: 注视参数能有效反映认知分心，交通复杂性和ACC使用对注视行为有显著影响。

Abstract: In this simulator study, we investigate how gaze parameters reflect driver
cognitive distraction under varying traffic conditions and adaptive cruise
control (ACC) use. Participants completed six driving scenarios that combined
two levels of cognitive distraction (with/without mental calculations) and
three levels of driving environment complexity. Throughout the experiment,
participants were free to activate or deactivate an ACC. We analyzed two
gaze-based indicators of driver cognitive distraction: the percent road center,
and the gaze dispersions (horizontal and vertical). Our results show that
vertical gaze dispersion increases with traffic complexity, while ACC use leads
to gaze concentration toward the road center. Cognitive distraction reduces
road center gaze and increases vertical dispersion. Complementary analyses
revealed that these observations actually arise mainly between mental
calculations, while periods of mental calculations are characterized by a
temporary increase in gaze concentration.

TL;DR: ParcoursVis是一种渐进式视觉分析工具，用于大规模探索电子健康记录序列，通过渐进算法快速显示近似结果并逐步优化，支持处理数千万患者数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具因处理整个数据集耗时较长，限制了交互性和数据规模。ParcoursVis旨在克服这一限制，支持更大规模数据分析，尤其是罕见医疗条件或意外患者路径的探索。

Method: 采用渐进算法，快速生成初始近似结果（冰柱树可视化），并通过迭代更新逐步优化。

Result: 能够处理数千万患者数据，每个患者包含数千事件，比同类系统高出3-5个数量级。

Conclusion: ParcoursVis为医疗数据分析提供了高效工具，支持大规模探索，并提出了开发渐进式系统的设计指南。

Abstract: We present ParcoursVis, a Progressive Visual Analytics tool designed to
explore electronic health record sequences of patients at scale. Existing tools
process and aggregate the whole dataset upfront before showing the
visualization, taking a time proportional to the data size. Therefore, to
remain interactive, existing tools are limited to data sizes that can be
processed in under a few seconds to meet the latency constraints of human
attention. To overcome this limitation and scale to larger sizes, ParcoursVis
relies on a progressive algorithm that quickly shows an approximate initial
result of the aggregation, visualized as an Icicle tree, and improves it
iteratively, updating the visualization until the whole computation is done.
With its architecture, ParcoursVis remains interactive while visualizing the
sequences of tens of millions of patients, each described with thousands of
events; three to five orders of magnitude more than similar systems. Managing
large datasets allows for exploring rare medical conditions or unexpected
patient pathways, contributing to improving treatments. We describe the
algorithms we use and our evaluation concerning their scalability, convergence,
and stability. We also report on a set of guidelines to support visualization
designers in developing scalable progressive systems. ParcoursVis already
allows practitioners to perform analyses on two large real medical datasets.
Our prototype is open-source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化差异、语言障碍和低社会经济地位导致重新安置人群难以获得医疗服务，现有研究多关注问题而非社区优势。

Method: 通过两次社区参与式设计工作坊，与30名美国苗族社区成员合作。

Result: 识别出社区已有的四种资产，如代际健康支持和基于故事的沟通方式。

Conclusion: 参与式设计工作坊可促进基于资产的方法，为技术设计提供启示。

Abstract: Individuals resettled in a new environment often face challenges in accessing
adequate healthcare services, particularly within the complex processes of
outpatient clinic care. Cultural differences, language barriers, and low
socioeconomic status contribute to these difficulties. While previous studies
have identified barriers and proposed technology-mediated solutions for
resettled populations, many focus on addressing deficits rather than building
on the strengths these communities already possess, which limits the
sustainability and relevance of these solutions in everyday life. We conducted
two community-based participatory design workshops with 30 Hmong community
members in a large metropolitan area in the US. Through this process, we
identified four types of assets the community has gradually developed,
including intergenerational support for health management and
storytelling-based communication practices that facilitate relatable and
culturally grounded interactions. We show how participatory design workshops
can foster asset-based approaches, and discuss design implications for
technologies that leverage patients' existing strengths to support their health
management during outpatient visits.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种概率模拟框架，用于量化地震结构健康监测（SSHM）在提升电力网络（EPN）韧性中的价值，结果显示SSHM可显著加速恢复并减少韧性缺失（LoR）达21%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电力网络恢复依赖耗时且不精确的人工检查，导致修复优先级不合理和服务中断延长，SSHM能提供更准确及时的损伤评估，但其系统级韧性效益尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究框架包括基于网络配置、灾害强度、脆弱性函数和损伤-功能映射的地震损伤建模，结合资源约束和修复时间的恢复模拟，并通过图论孤岛检测和最优潮流分析评估系统功能。

Result: 结果显示，通过SSHM提升损伤感知能力可显著加速恢复，并将LoR降低高达21%。

Conclusion: 该研究为关键基础设施中SSHM的部署提供了基于证据的决策支持。

Abstract: Post-earthquake recovery of electric power networks (EPNs) is critical to
community resilience. Traditional recovery processes often rely on prolonged
and imprecise manual inspections for damage diagnosis, leading to suboptimal
repair prioritization and extended service disruptions. Seismic Structural
Health Monitoring (SSHM) offers the potential to expedite recovery by enabling
more accurate and timely damage assessment. However, SSHM deployment incurs
costs, and its system-level resilience benefit remains underexplored. This
study proposes a probabilistic simulation framework to quantify the value of
SSHM for enhancing EPN resilience. The framework includes seismic damage
modeling based on network configuration, hazard intensity, fragility functions,
and damage-functionality mappings, combined with recovery simulations
incorporating resource constraints, repair and transfer durations. System
functionality is evaluated using graph-based island detection and optimal power
flow analysis. Resilience is quantified via the Lack of Resilience (LoR) metric
derived from the functionality restoration curve. SSHM is incorporated by
altering the quality of damage information used in repair scheduling. Different
monitoring scenarios (e.g., no-SSHM baseline, partial SSHM, full SSHM with
various accuracies) are modeled using confusion matrices to simulate damage
misclassification. Results show that improved damage awareness via SSHM
significantly accelerates recovery and reduces LoR by up to 21%. This work
supports evidence-based decisions for SSHM deployment in critical
infrastructure.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合安全分析师和领域专家意见的方法，通过蒙特卡洛模拟和动态优先级矩阵，更客观地优先处理STPA分析中的不安全控制行为（UCAs），并应用于eVTOL项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STPA分析中UCAs数量庞大且优先级管理困难，现有方法在客观性和结果沟通上存在挑战。

Method: 结合安全分析师和领域专家意见，评估UCAs严重性、控制器影响因子，并引入蒙特卡洛模拟减少主观性，开发动态优先级矩阵。

Result: 在eVTOL项目中识别出318个UCAs，其中110个被列为高优先级，需优先处理以提升系统安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了UCAs优先级的客观性，并改善了结果沟通，适用于复杂系统的安全分析。

Abstract: Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a widely recommended method for
analysing complex system safety. STPA can identify numerous Unsafe Control
Actions (UCAs) and requirements depending on the level of granularity of the
analysis and the complexity of the system being analysed. Managing numerous
results is challenging, especially during a fast-paced development lifecycle.
Extensive research has been done to optimize the efficiency of managing and
prioritising the STPA results. However, maintaining the objectivity of
prioritisation and communicating the prioritised results have become common
challenges. In this paper, the authors present a complementary approach that
incorporates inputs from both the safety analysts and domain experts to more
objectively prioritise UCAs. This is done by evaluating the severity of each
UCA, the impact factor of each controller or decision maker that issues the
UCA, and the ranking provided by the subject matter experts who assess the UCA
criticalities based on different factors. In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation
is introduced to reduce subjectivity and relativity, thus enabling more
objective prioritisation of the UCAs. As part of the approach to better
communicate the prioritisation results and plan the next steps of system
development, a dynamic-scaling prioritisation matrix was developed to capture
different sets of prioritised UCAs. The approach was applied to a real project
to improve the safe operations of Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing
(eVTOL). The results highlighted critical UCAs that need to be prioritised for
safer eVTOL operation. 318 UCAs were identified in total. Based on the
application of the prioritisation methodology, 110 were recognized as
high-priority UCAs to strengthen the system design.

Result: 该策略成功跟踪强度最小值，显著降低纳米粒子的残余状态方差，有效降低其质心温度。

Conclusion: LQG控制可扩展到量子领域，为未来量子态制备实验提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this work, we develop and analyze adaptive feedback control strategies to
stabilize and confine a nanoparticle at the unstable intensity minimum of an
optical double-well potential. The resulting stochastic optimal control problem
for a noise-driven mechanical particle in a nonlinear optical potential must
account for unavoidable experimental imperfections such as measurement
nonlinearities and slow drifts of the optical setup. To address these issues,
we simplify the model in the vicinity of the unstable equilibrium and employ
indirect adaptive control techniques to dynamically follow changes in the
potential landscape. Our approach leads to a simple and efficient Linear
Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller that can be implemented on fast and
cost-effective FPGAs, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility. We
demonstrate that this strategy successfully tracks the intensity minimum and
significantly reduces the nanoparticle's residual state variance, effectively
lowering its center-of-mass temperature. While conventional optical traps rely
on confining optical forces in the light field at the intensity maxima,
trapping at intensity minima mitigates absorption heating, which is crucial for
advanced quantum experiments. Since LQG control naturally extends into the
quantum regime, our results provide a promising pathway for future experiments
on quantum state preparation beyond the current absorption heating limitation,
like matter-wave interference and tests of the quantum-gravity interface.

Motivation: 随着可再生能源在电力系统中的渗透率增加，系统调峰压力加剧，需求侧资源（如空调负荷）因其调节潜力和快速响应能力受到关注。

Result: 仿真验证了模型和方法的有效性，实现了用户舒适度与经济效益的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为FFACs参与DR提供了可行方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the continuous increase in the penetration of renewable energy in the
emerging power systems, the pressure on system peak regulation has been
significantly intensified. Against this backdrop, demand side resources
particularly air conditioning loads have garnered considerable attention for
their substantial regulation potential and fast response capabilities, making
them promising candidates for providing auxiliary peak shaving services. This
study focuses on fixed frequency air conditioners (FFACs) and proposes an
optimization model and solution method for their participation in demand
response (DR) programs. First, a probabilistic response model for FFACs is
developed based on the Markov assumption. Second, by sampling this
probabilistic model, the aggregate power consumption of an FFAC cluster under
decentralized control is obtained. Subsequently, a robust optimization model is
formulated to maximize the profit of an aggregator managing the FFAC cluster
during DR events, taking into account the aggregated response power. The model
explicitly considers temperature uncertainty to ensure user comfort in a robust
sense. Finally, leveraging the structure of the proposed model, it is
reformulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved
using a commercial optimization solver. Simulation results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and solution approach.

Method: 结合知识图谱嵌入台风路径向量，构建确定性网络预测风电，并通过去噪网络和随机微分方程（SDE）采样误差。

Result: 在9个海上风电场数据上验证，SCDM在台风条件下优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SCDM方法有效提升了台风条件下海上风电预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Offshore wind power (OWP) exhibits significant fluctuations under typhoon
conditions, posing substantial challenges to the secure operation of power
systems. Accurate forecasting of OWP is therefore essential. However, the
inherent scarcity of historical typhoon data and stochasticity of OWP render
traditional point forecasting methods particularly difficult and inadequate. To
address this challenge and provide grid operators with the comprehensive
information necessary for decision-making, this study proposes a score-based
conditional diffusion model (SCDM) for probabilistic forecasting of OWP during
typhoon events. First, a knowledge graph algorithm is employed to embed
historical typhoon paths as vectors. Then, a deterministic network is
constructed to predict the wind power under typhoon conditions based on these
vector embeddings. Finally, to better characterize prediction errors, a
denoising network is developed. At the core of this approach is a
mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE), which transforms complex
error distributions into a standard Gaussian, enabling the sampling of
forecasting errors using a reverse-time SDE. The probabilistic forecasting
results are reconstructed by combining deterministic forecasts with sampled
errors. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world data from a cluster
of 9 offshore wind farms. Results demonstrate that under typhoon conditions,
our approach outperforms baseline models for both deterministic and
probabilistic metrics, verifying the effectiveness of the approach.

Abstract: An innovative multi-functional static-passive electromagnetic skin (SP-EMS)
solution is proposed to simultaneously support, in reflection, two independent
wave-manipulation functionalities with a single meta-atoms arrangement on the
EMS aperture when illuminated by two EM sources operating at the same
frequency, but working in different polarization states. Towards this end, a
simple reference meta-atom is designed first to enable an accurate and
independent control of each polarization component of the local reflection
tensor. Successively, the macro-scale synthesis of multi-polarization (MP)
SP-EMSs (MP-SP-EMSs) is carried out by solving a global optimization problem
where a cost function, which mathematically codes separate requirements for
each polarization, is minimized with a customized version of the
system-by-design (SbD) technique. Representative results from a set of
numerical and experimental tests are reported to assess the feasibility of a
multi-function EMS based on polarization diversity as well as the effectiveness
and the robustness of the proposed method for the synthesis of MP-SP-EMSs.

Abstract: Sustainability is paramount in modern cellular networks, which face
significant energy consumption challenges from rising mobile traffic and
advancements in wireless technology. Cell-switching, well-established in
literature as an effective solution, encounters limitations such as inadequate
capacity and limited coverage when implemented through terrestrial networks
(TN). This study enhances cell-switching by integrating non-terrestrial
networks (NTN), including satellites (used for cell-switching for the first
time), high altitude platform stations (HAPS), and uncrewed aerial vehicles
(UAVs) into TN. This integration significantly boosts energy savings by
expanding capacity, enhancing coverage, and increasing operational flexibility.
We introduce a multi-tier cell-switching approach that dynamically offloads
users across network layers to manage energy effectively and minimize delays,
accommodating diverse user demands with a context aware strategy. Additionally,
we explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative
AI, in optimizing network efficiency through data compression, handover
optimization between different network layers, and enhancing device
compatibility, further improving the adaptability and energy efficiency of
cell-switching operations. A case study confirms substantial improvements in
network power consumption and user satisfaction, demonstrating the potential of
our approach for future networks.

Abstract: Platooning has emerged as a promising strategy for improving fuel efficiency
in automated vehicle systems, with significant implications for reducing
emissions and operational costs. While existing literature on vehicle
platooning primarily focuses on individual aspects such as aerodynamic drag
reduction or specific control strategies, this work takes a more comprehensive
approach by bringing together a wide range of factors and components that
contribute to fuel savings in platoons. In this literature review, we examine
the impact of platooning on fuel consumption, highlighting the key components
of platoon systems, the factors and actors influencing fuel savings, methods
for estimating fuel use, and the effect of platoon instability on efficiency.
Furthermore, we study the role of reduced aerodynamic drag, vehicle
coordination, and the challenges posed by instability in real-world conditions.
By compiling insights from recent studies, this work provides a comprehensive
overview of the latest advancements in platooning technologies and highlights
both the challenges and opportunities for future research to maximize fuel
savings in real-world scenarios.
