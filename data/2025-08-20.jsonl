In\nthis paper, we ask whether reactive users, who are cognizant of the influence\nof the content they consume, can prevent such changes by adaptively adjusting\ntheir content consumption choices. To this end, we study users' opinion\ndynamics under two types of stochastic policies: a passive policy where the\nprobability of clicking on recommended content is fixed and a reactive policy\nwhere clicking probability adaptively decreases following large opinion drifts.\nWe analytically derive the expected opinion and user utility under these\npolicies. We show that the adaptive policy can help users prevent opinion\ndrifts and that when a user prioritizes opinion preservation, the expected\nutility of the adaptive policy outperforms the fixed policy. We validate our\ntheoretical findings through numerical simulations. These findings help better\nunderstand how user-level strategies can challenge the biases induced by\nrecommendation systems."}

COCO\nemploys three key algorithmic innovations to address systematic and stochastic\nerrors: (1) Contextual Rollback Mechanism - a stateful restart protocol that\npreserves execution history and error diagnostics, enabling informed\nre-computation rather than naive retry; (2) Bidirectional Reflection Protocol -\na mutual validation system between monitoring and execution modules that\nprevents oscillatory behavior and ensures convergence; (3) Heterogeneous\nCross-Validation - leveraging model diversity to detect systematic biases and\nhallucinations through ensemble disagreement metrics. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark multi-agent tasks demonstrate 6.5\\% average performance improvement,\nestablishing new state-of-the-art for autonomous workflow reliability."}

Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions\nof cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each\ncoalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation\ncan be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete\nmechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley\nvalue, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it\nassumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.\nInfinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized\nthrough new axioms and mechanisms.

There are two\nprominent problems in the transient stability analysis of GFLC-LIS. The angular\ndynamic of LIS increases the complexity of transient stability analysis, and\nthe nonlinear, possibly negative damping of GFLC makes it difficult to\nguarantee the conservative of the traditional methods. These problems make the\ntraditional methods inapplicable. In this paper, the transient stability\nanalysis of GFLC LIS is investigated to provide an accurate estimation of the\nattraction boundary and critical clearance time (CCT).

A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to\nnavigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,\ncorridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and\nhumans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These\nassumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described\ninformally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for\ncomparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners\nto find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc\nrepresentation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting\nto start research in this area.

In this\npaper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that\ngenerates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by\nstrategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a\nmulti-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial\nexamples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and\npropagates the result to the next stage.

To address the combinatorial\nnature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured\nsubset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding\noptimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of\naudio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a\nuser study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat\nprediction sets."}

These blast holes need to\nbe inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and\nproperties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in\nmaterial handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow\nand expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological\nproperties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for\nthe development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - \"DIPPeR\". In\nthis paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a\nrobust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based\nnavigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first\nprocesses point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting\nthe cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D\ncone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D\ndomain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.\nWe then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while\nsuppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for\ndown-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable\nautonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection\nparameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity\nand hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This\nallows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal\npoint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system\nin both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests.

Our framework enables\nindividual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional\nexpression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four\nlightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent\nspaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively.

Key findings demonstrate that\nthe LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects\noutliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming\nexact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)\nwere highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those\nwith successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas\nfailure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460).

The insight behind\nDictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for\nunseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the\nnormal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,\nDictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -\nto simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from\nnormal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region\nfeatures from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature\ncannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly.

The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions.

Among\nthem, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its\nconsistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice\ndue to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both\ntraining and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply\napplying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we\nrevisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow\nQ-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action\ngeneration during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary\nmodels, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates\nDQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While\nconventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step\ngeneration, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates\ndirect, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for\nmulti-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster\nand more robust training and inference.
